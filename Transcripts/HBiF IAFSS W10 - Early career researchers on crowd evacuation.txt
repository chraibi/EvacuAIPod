Introduction by Enrico Ronchi

So I hope you can all hear me. My name is Enrico Ronchi, and I want to all welcome you to our 10th event of our webinar series of the UN behavior in fires permanent group of the International Association of Fire Safety Science, and I am leading this group together with Dr ER kigosi from rmit in Australia. 
Unfortunately, we had to accommodate many times zones around the world, so we had to pick a time this time that fit more East Coast, us and North America and Europe and part of Asia. So it's middle of the night in Australia. So of course you could not be year, and I also want to acknowledge Arthur roer from L University, who is the PHD student that is helping me in setting up everything for this webinar series. 
We have a set of ongoing activities in our group and the. webinar s is one of them. The other main activity in which we are engaged is the set up of a resarch agenda in the field of Ying Fire And for those of you that are signed up to the mailing list of the group, you probably seen that recently we have published our first paper that presents an overview on the field. 
So to join our group is actually free and you just sign up and you can remain updated on our activity. I hope Arthur can help me with the posting this in the chat. I think yes, I already did so. Thanks a lot, Arthur, always efficient. 
So today we have a very nice and interesting presentation with the Dr. Oain tavana as a first Speaker who completed is PhD at UL University in December 2023, and he focused on microscopic pedestrian movement and crowd Dynamics and. receiv received in 2021 a g award and works now as a fire engineer at idro. 
Then we have Dr y Tong, a post postdoctor research at the University of Edinburgh, specializing in crowd modeling and emergency behavior, and his research explores how attributes influence individual and crowd Behavior through VR experiments and competi methods. And then we have kadia B from Caron University, focusing on privacy and you be emergencies, and she contributed to research on genetic privacy, accessibility, misinformation, vacation reporting. 
So, as you know, the event of today is fully dedicated to early career researchers. So I think we should support people that are entering our field and are have the young energy to bring new insights into the field of UN behav in fire. So since we have three speakers, the format for today is that we will have about 12 minutes each for each speaker. 
And we will start with oin, then Kad and then Yuna, and then we will take questions at the end. So in the meanwhile, during the presentations, you're welcome to write your comments or questions in the chat and we will then take them at the end. So I now stop my sharing and I ask our first Speaker, who is Hussein, to please share a slides and go ahead with his presentation. 
And I don't think we can hear your saying. Yet you can't see my screen. Now we can hear you. Yes, oh okay, perfect, can you see my screen as well? Not yet we saw it for a second. But let's stop Shar, start sharing again. Okay, it's now yeah, loing, yes, here we are. 


Presentation by Hossein Tavanarezaei

Please go ahead, but it's is it in present. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good, perfect. Thank you very. 
Much for your nice introduction, enrio and happy International women's day. My name is H tavana and in this presentation I will talk about the new experimental methods and parameters for microscopic models of croud mov movement, which is a high overview of my PhD research at Aller University. 
I did my bachelor in civil engineering and my master in highand transportation engineering and just finished my PhD at allate University in fire safety Engineering in December 2023, and currently I work as in the Fire Safety Division of hyra. When I was a first year Master student, a fire happened in Plus go and many people, actually many firefighters, die, and I was thinking of how we can improve the safety in emergencies for all. 
So I decided to do a Research in Crowd movement field in Crowd field to with the ultimate goal of making the world a. safer and more convenient place for all. So we designed a series of experiments with fish B neck and narrow B neck to see which one is more efficient and if Financial Buton are more efficient, which Financial Buton has the most efficiency and the speed trajectories of each person, evacuation, time, flow, Etc. 
Were extracted and finally it was understood that funnel shap Buton next are more efficient than narrow Buton and the most efficient fin Buton was so. From this slide I will talk about my PhD research. Crowd movement models have many simplifications, use the data usually gathered in the middle of 20th century and use speed flow density relationships that are valid. 
Indeed, as you can see in this figure that's taken from a study by at all, you can see speed flow. The speed density relationships are varied from s study to another study and. it is even questioned by their own, by their own Originators. 
So we need to use an up toate model with up toate data to be able to simulate and reproduce the movement of the population of buildings today or in the future, rather than using a constant flu rate for all population and a constant evacuation time for all spaces. 
The main aim of this study was to leverage experimental data to explore the parameters of the movement of individuals moving in a crowd and their inter relationships, to inform the development of a mathematical model of crowd movement, and the objectives were to develop a deep understanding of microscopic movement characteristics of individuals in consisted space, using interdisciplinary overview to investigate movement parameters, their inter relationships and influencing factor in single file and wider flu, using empirical insights, empirical data to explore the movement parameters of the stop. 
Start working behavior of individuals using empirical data, and to re to review and refine the movement adaption model of pedestrian Dynamics. Movement adaption model was firstly introduced and developed by Dr Peter Thompson and has the potential to be further developed to reproduce the movement of people with different characteristics and different abilities, like different ages or disabilities, Etc. And finally, to summarize the outcomes in a form that may be used to inform mathematical models. 
In other word, I wanted to inform the development of the movement adaption model, which considers the physics of individuals and considers the biomechanics of movement rather than speed flow, density, relationships or simplifications, like forces or discrete space or time, and the objectives were to find to determine the appropriate parameters and find the differential inter relationships between the parameters. Movement adaption model considers the maximum occupied by maximum occupied Space by. 
Individuals by considering their steps and the contact distance between themselves the a basic equation of this model is defined th in this equation, interperson distance equals to step extent plus contact buffer, which Step extent is the maximum back heel to front to distance of an individual, which is slightly less than the step length plus foot length, and contact buffer is the minimum distance between two consecutive pedestrians, which is the front of the person behind the back heel of the person in front. 
Finally, we can produce the flow rate by dividing speed to interperson distance, which is the reverse of density in a single file. To confirm the basic equation and further development of the model, a serious of experiments were conducted at L University and 59 participants attended that in a single file and wider flow, a cirquit was created using chairs and dropes were. used to confine this. 
Four met part of the path and three cameras were placed to collect data, one outside the path, one inside the path and one above different starting densities. We had different starting densities to see the effect of the density on different gate characteristics in both single file and wi flow trials and the participants were instructed to work as they naturally do, given the number of people around themselves, in a single file and in wider flow, as you can see here. They could work side by side, but they were not permitted to overtake each other in different trials. 
Another series of experiments were held at University College Dublin with 16 participants in groups of four participants. One researcher worked in front of the group. Another person was behind the group to produce the same situation for all in a 14 M path three. 
Cod receivers were set up and pedestrians participants weree six sensors, one on shoulder, on arm, on feet and leg of participants, and these three receivers made us made us enable to collect the data in 10 m of the path and the trials were in an uninterrupted work and in a work with stop in the middle of that, in the middle of the path that I will call it interrupted trials. 
The reason of having two different kind of experiments was to compare different, collect different methods for collecting data and to compare different experimental conditions. In UCD we density in sorry in Lo we had density and in UCD the speed of people was controlled by the researcher was in front of the group. Also to analyze and characterize the interrupted trials, we needed a dat. We needed to data with a high accuracy. Different analysis were. 
Done and different inter relationships were extracted, and here in this slide you can see two of the most important factors: step extent versus speed and contact buffer versus speed in a single file and in uninterrupted work in UCD. As you can see in both trials, step extent increased by increasing speed. However, for a given speed in lower speeds, you see participants in UCD to Greater steps. 
That was because of the different experimental conditions where in UCD experiments, pedestrians were under less pressure to go ahead to take a step and they could stop, have they preferred distance with the person in front and then they could take their steps, and in lond University they had to shuffle forward when they had a small space in front of themselves, as you can see here, because of the nature of the experiment, also in the contact buffer versus. 
Speed. You can see contact buffer was constant in both scenarios, up to 04 meter per second for the Lo and up to 7 m per second for UCD, and that it increased. It increased linearly by increasing the speed. Again, you can see in loan, we had less contact buffer. 
Also, it was negative that is showing the overlap between the F between the front foot of the follower of the person behind and back heel of the person in front. All these analysis were done also in wider flow to understand the differences between single file and why they flow, and we found some differences. To find the root of those differences. 
The participants, the people in trial were separated, were categorized in two groups, one direct leader and followers of direct leader, where the people didn't have any offset with the person in front and the followers. of an offset leader or offset leaders, where pedestrians had an offset with the person in front, as you can see here, and it was found that the root of these differences is coming from offset leader group. 
Also, the differences between men and women in rocketing Crow were investigated, and it was found that women tended to keep more distance with the person in front by taking less frequent steps but greater steps. However, these differences were not statistically significant. I think the most interesting part of my research was characterizing the stop start walking Behavior or an uninterrupted work, and in this slide you can see how it happens. 
The red line is the right foot, the blue line is the left foot and the green line is the shoulder of participants, and we got data in XY Z and time in spreadsheets to characterize data first the. trajectories of participants with the heat map of speed was extracted. However, we needed some Concepts and some characterization of the sard working Behavior to be able to characterize and quantify that. 
So by using the concepts in transportation engineering, we characterized the stop process to perception reaction time and slow down time and the startup to Startup time delay similar to traffic vehicle traffic theory, vehicle traffic theory perception reaction time was the time taken for an individual to understand the speed changes of the person in front is happening, to perceive that, to understand that and decide and start reacting. 
Slowdown time was the time taken from the reaction to the fullest stop and startup time delay was the time difference between consecutive pesterian to start working again using signal processing methods and low pass butter worth filter the data and use interperson distance and relative interperson. speed to be able to analyze this data and characters stop a start working process. 
You see different times here what happened and here is one sample considering both interperson distance and relative interperson speed in a Time window before the full stop of both the leader, the person in front, started reducing their speed. And you see, interperson distance is decreasing and also relative interperson speed is decreasing at the point that the follower, the person behind, started reacting. 
The relative inter person speed reaches its own minimum wi the inter personent distance is still decreasing and at the fullest stop, inter personent distance is almost constant. And also relative inter personent speed up and down is because of the natural body movement and natural body sway in overall, in average perception, reaction time was found to be 48 seconds. The Slowdown time was 50,8 seconds and startup. time delay was 39 seconds. 
Overally different relationships between different gate characteristics and distances with speed was found in both single file and wider flow, and novel mety was developed to characterize stop start working behavior, and different components were Quantified and the model was updated based on the result of this study. However, I just present Ed a high overview of that and if you're interested in you can email me and have a discussion on that. 
And at the end, I would like to acknowledge my supervisory team, Dr K Boyce, Dr Peter Thompson and Dr Denis M gra, and also I would like to thank to Dr hak Fran and Professor Daniel nson for sharing the experimental D data and for their thoughts in different stages of this work, and this is my email and looking forward discussing on this. Thank you. Thank youin for your interesting. presentation as mentioned. 
We will take all questions at the end, but in the meanwhile, as mentioned. If anyone has any comments or question, you can also put them in the chat and I will moderate them at the end. I suggest we go ahead in the meanwhile with the second speaker of today. I think we have Hadad first as second or you go first. Okay, that's fine. You go first. So please put in presentation mode your presentation. 


Presentation by Yunhe Tong

Yeah already very good. So the floor is yours, you okay. Thank youo and thank you everyone. My name is currently I'm a PO dog at University Edinburgh working on using social psychology knowledge to understand patran behavior in evacuations and help evacuation management. It's my pleasure to give a talk today. My topic is how psychological factors shape of diine good choice in emergency emergencies inside from empirical investigations. 
When it comes to the prodr rout Choice, there are two categories of factors that influence human decision making, which have been extensively studied. The first category is individual characteristics, including age, gender, root preference, and the second category is the root attributes, including datain cers familiarities. 
Here in this talk, I want to bring your attention that the psychological factors are important as well, which can help as understand the human decision making, but also can help create more cured P Dynamics models, but it has received less attention as it deserves in the talk. I will use three examples to demonstrate the influence of psychological factors on patrian Choice. The first example is we call diming importance of environmental kills. 
Previous research have done a lot of work in single choice, where people only need to make one decision. Here in this scenario, we consider the root Choice. sequences where people have to make more than one decisions and we assume that earlier choices can impact subsequent ones. We also found that previous research has established that a Lar number and the more complex root decisions along a path increases the cognative load. 
Also, there's a concept called decision fatiga in psychological research, which refers to the quality of decisions made by individual decreases after a long session. Involving many decisions that means the quality of decisions decrease with the increasing quantity of decisions. So, based on this fact, we made the following hypothesis: the sensitivity of patrin to environmental information diminish at the number of decisions they have to make consecutively increases. 
To test our hypothesis, we create a scenario and showing in this figure. It shows the top view of the building and here the yellow Circle represent the participants and they don't have any knowledge. about the building. They have to rely on the movements or others represented by the red circle to make a decision, and you can see the building. There are lots of Junctions. 
At each Junction we assume the participants how to decide whether to follow the crowd or not, and also you may notice that the simulator pedet will go around the building in a circle U that means if the participant decide to follow the crowd, they won't never get out the building until they decide to stop following and choose the set root where they can find the exit. Here is how the event looks like this. 
This is the control by the participants and they can move the move, this character using their keyboard and they can decide whether to follow the crow or not. They choose the follow and we speed up and if they choose. to follow. They just follow the C unless they decide not to follow and finally they can find the exit after we conduct the environment. We got the data. 
We create a mathematic model U to co to incorporate the hypothesis in our model, and we found that the model, considering on the diminishing information, can fit the impairment data better than the model, without considering the hypothesis, which has supported our hypothesis. Here's the first example and another example we call increasing adherence to pre plan route. 
The scenario here is that we assume people have planned their route, but when they are working along their Planet route they encounter a congestion. And now they have two options. The first option is to wait and stti their planner route. The other options is to choose the alternative route, and both options will take them the same time to reach. their desired destination. We consider two conditions. The first condition we call it low investment. 
That means you are just beginning the journey. You don't have. You haven't make any investment to your planet route, and in contrast we have condition B called high investment. You have already been working far well in your plan route. That means you have already investment AOW to your plan route, and our hypothesis is, as pedestrians invest more in a plan route by working along it, that they tend to adhere to that route and increases. 
And we also can find some relevant theory in psychological research, which called commitment and consistency, which refers to the Align Behavior with cor values for internal Harmony. It can simplify decision making and process by using past decisions as GS, but it also will lead to negative consequences such as the pl continuation bars, which means. people are more likely to stick to plant, despite changing circumstance. 
Stes, for example, par May maintain their planed causing accidents, even if changing could prevent disasters. So here we made the hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using online survey and with same we provide the participants with the back, with the condition on low investment where participants just start their journey and ha investment where participant have working far well along their plan route and we ask them which route to choose. 
They either can stick to their plan route or they can choose another route, and both sub are equally good. Take the same time for them to read the detination. Also, we optionally provideed the participants with quantitative information. Then here our results, and we found that participants tend to choose the alternative route rather than the ConEd plan route. We also find that they are more. 
Likely to stake the plan root where they were closer to the detonation. Our hypothesis have been supported by the servey data. And the last example is about response to the movements of the crowd. By reviewing previous research we found some diverse result on that TR whether follow the crow or not. In some models we found some research just assume people will follow the crowd. 
But for some other models they just assume people try to avoid others with making ex choices even about the s% of the consequence that the code researchers how different SS. Some people think it will reduce patri evacuation efficiency. 
Some people think is help optim optimize the aing system and in contrast, in empirical fings about whether people follow the crow, people have different assumptions, different findings, and some people found that the direction preferred by majority doesn't have a s significant. effect and some others found that people spontaneously tend to follow others and others found that they not follow the majority. Instead they follow the minority. 
So, based on this, we made our hypothesis that how people respond to the movements of CR depends on the context, and we assume three different contal factors. The first one we call it spal information, to indicate whether we provide with special information. The second one we call croud State. It shows the congestion level of simulate prodction around the exit. You can see the figure. 
If the C state is bsy, that means c will abstract the participants. That means the participants how to wait if they want to go through the exit. And another we call free. That means there only few people around the exit and the participants can move through the crow freely. and the second one we call Crow split, which shows the distribution of the individual cross exit and un distribution. Un distribution and0 to one split. 
Z to split refer to other people will choose the same exit. And then here is example how we conduct the enironment and here the training section. They how to formulate themselves with how to control the movements of the part of the character and provide this them with the map. And they will observe the movs others and decide which a it to take and the results. 
We found that P TR have innate tenden to avoid Crow and with spatial information is avilable. It influence more than the coud. And also we found that petan avoid and absolutely emper the exit, even if it otherwise has theable properties. Now let make summary. I use three example to demonstrate how psychological factors influence. ping decision making, evacuations di Mission Reliance on environmental kill and the increase adherent to pre plan route. 
Also War the rebound to the others movements. Here I want to summary the highlights. The first one is psychological factors significance in pedan behavior and also we found the small but detectable effect size in spe specific scenarios, and I want to bring attention again. Understand the influence of psychologic factors cannot just what, but why people behave in certain ways. Thank you, I answer question at the end. Thanks un for your nice presentation. 
As mentioned earlier, if you have questions, we will take them at the end and you can write them in the chat. So it's now time for kadia to present her work. So kadia, can you please share your screen? Yes, before I go ahead and do that, can you hear me? Okay, yes, very well. perfect. Okay, excellent, let's see, here is it up looks good. 


Presentation by Khadija Baig

Yes, all good. Please go ahead, excellent, well, hi everybody. 
Today I'll be talking about my research on the design, development and evaluation of an evacuation reporting template. This research was conducted with the national research Council of Canada as part of an internship through Carlton University Ottawa. ER drills, as we know them, are pre planned reenactments of evacuations, most obviously used for legal reasons. Data gathered during drills can also be used for training, research and performance assessment purposes. 
Unfortunately, this data collection is often Inc consistent or incomplete. For example, while some reports might contain detailed observations, others might simply state that a drill has occurred. This limits how useful this data actually is. To this end, we argue that one barrier to effective drill recording is the lack of a standardized reporting template, such a. template would provide consistency, facilitate effective comparisons across different events and provide a systematic means to comprehensive data collection. 
To address this, we developed an evacuation reporting template for large multi site organizations. This was done over several iterations. I'm going to briefly walk us through this process. First, we conducted a literature review to understand the qualities of a good evacuation report. We use the results of this review and an existing form from our organization as a starting point to draft a new template. 
Next, we used a survey to elicit feedback on our Forum from 30 fire safety experts and users. This was implementation test one. We used the feedback to revise the form and then conducted a second Implement implementation test with 11 experts and users. After the second test, we finalized the form, creating our final template. The final template was then adapted by a. major organization after it was used in practice. 
We conducted three follow up interviews with safety officers who had either already used the template or were going to do so for additional insights. In our research, we found that good evacuation reporting forms are usable, covering General usability attributes like how easy it is to complete and how long it takes to do so, request relevant information only the necessary details of the incident being reported and request information that is accessible to the person filling out the form. We use these metrics for our initial design and to evaluate the form through our surveys and our interviews. 
Now let's start with what's essential to query for during an evacuation. We identified five categories of key incident requirements. First, we have base conditions. These are just the circumstances under which the evacuation occurred, like the date, the time, the weather. next, we have building information, so the descriptions of a building's physical characteristics, like how many occupants it can hold or its egress attributes. 
Next, we have the context or scenario under which the evacuation was initiated, like whether it was planned, planned or unplanned, for example, Performance also should be measured. This includes numeric metrics like evacuation time or qualitative information like occupant and Personnel Behavior. Finally, we have reflection. This involves subjective, qualitative observations by individuals involved in the evacuation, which may provide critical insights. 
Now that we've covered key incident data requirements, I'll touch briefly upon usability was divided into two sections. First, we had the usability of the form itself. This was a paper form that we were designing, so we had to be careful with designing the structure, making sure there wasn't too much content on a page, margins, font size, all those sort of. details. 
Next, we had to consider the usability of the items on the Forum or the for Fields. They needed to be easy and ideally quick to complete with language that was clear and minimal room for misunderstanding. We created a preliminary template that met the key information and usability requirements and then conducted two surveys for iterative improvement. In the survey, participants were provided with an evacuation scenario at a typical in person workplace pre pandemic. 
They were asked to fill out the template based on the scenario and then fill out the survey based on their experience of using it, providing both qualitative and quantitative feedback. This took about 15 to 20 minutes. As mentioned earlier, we used the metrics of relev usability and information accessibility to design our survey questions. First we asked about the general perceptions of evacuation forms, for example, how strongly do participants agree? 
That they've been frustrated while filling out one of these forms or that these forms are useful. Participants were also asked to provide specific feedback on each section of the form, so they were presented one section at a time and were asked the same questions across all of them. Examples of these questions include: how easy was it to understand the section, or is it easy to obtain the information for the section? 
Finally, we asked about participant perceptions of the form as a whole. In the next slide I'm going to go over some results for this particular sort of question, which also demonstrates the type of statements we asked as promised. Here's some sample results on how participants felt about the form overall. This graph refers to test one. Now let's walk through what the graph means. On the left we have the questions that we asked. participants. 
Next note the middle axis. Here the blue bars to the right of the axis signify where participants agreed with the statement, while the orange and the red bars to the left signified the percentage of participants that disagreed. Results were generally positive here. For the sake of time, I will only go over the first two statements. Let's start with a statement. At the top it reads: the form was easy to complete. 
Moving over to the xaxis, you can see at a glance that most participants agreed with the statement. Because of how much blue there is, this is reversed for the second statement. Most participants disagreed that the form was time consuming to complete. Even outside of these specific results, most participants agreed on the relevance of our forms content, as well as saying that they typically had access to all the information needed to complete. the form. 
Majority of the changes we made to the form were based on usability. In the first iteration, we had comments that focused on the structure and interpretation of some fields. For example, we had a section titled organizational presence that participants found difficult to complete. We restructured the section in response entirely and added extra text for clarification where appropriate. In the second iteration, we had a small number of issues surrounding Clarity and accuracy that were identified. 
Specifically, there were comments on how certain Fields could not always be accurately completed for the final version. We emphasized that these were asking for estimates. All other changes were very minor, with only a few changes to wording and no major restructuring or reorganization. Welcome to the final template. It spans the front and the back of a single page in addition to another page for comments you can't. 
See it, but the comment page has no lines on it for writing. It's just a big text box in case someone needs room to draw or needs extra room for whatever reason. I'll briefly go over the sections of our form. First we have the general information section that queries some basic conditions and building information data. Next, we have room for some organizational information, specifically Personnel that may be involved. 
After this we queried information about the evacuation. This was a mixture of quantitative and qualitative information, asking more about the evacuation context and performance metrics. On the flip side of the page we have our longest section evaluation. Most of these questions are yes or no, with some space for comments with the binary questions. We also use the section to identify if there were any challenges and provide Personnel this chance to suggest corrective actions or. 
Add more comments and finally, we have room for signatures of whoever may need to sign off on the report. The final template was adapted by our organization, the national research Council of Canada for use and evacuations. We interviewed three end users from within the organization and gain some additional and somewhat unexpected insights. 
First I'd like to note how the end users did fundamentally feel that standardized forms are necessary, as expressed by P2. I think it's very important that we have a standard form that can be used to track and record everything. Our interview is felt that the form colored covered all relevant information, comprehensively, statements like I think everything can be addressed. Supported this. The interviews also agreed that the form overall was usable, easy and quick to complete. 
For example, P3 said I like the new one. It's very precise and it's easy to. fill in has lots of information. Some participants attributed this to the improved layout of the form P1, for example, expressed that formatting just might make it appear to be a little bit more friendly. While the information we queried or the form query generally seemed accessible. Participants pointed out specific concerns about recording accurate evacuation times, especially if the evacuation was unplanned. 
This observation is supported by a previous study which shows that reported total evacuation times of drills are often likely to be either estimates or rounded. In addition, we found that the process of standardization itself might yield unexpected insights into organizational practices. For example, P2 identified an open feedback loop. We often submit tickets, but the reporting of whether it's been looked at or not does not always get back to us. 
It would be nice to have that documented. Another participant noted potential for further. standardization P1 revealed in the new one. There's a question: was the evacuation checklist completed? I went through all my notes from security training and confirmed with my building authority, and we couldn't find anything. How did you end up putting it on the form if it isn't standard something that's standardized from one end of the council to the other? 
These insights highlight how simply going through the process required taking a critical look at and re evaluating existing organizational measures. Doing so may shed light on structural or organizational issues requiring us to recognize and address that had not been identified until starting this process. Given these insights, we consider standardization might be a valuable tool. Beyond reporting and our research has highlighted the importance, benefits and needs for systematic, comprehensive documentation in the field. 
Thank you so much for your time today. I would also like to. thank my colleagues Martin amamos, Steve Gwyn and nine benu, and my supervisor, Max, for helping the research get to the point that it's today, and I look forward to chatting about the research. We have a paper under review which I'm happy to forward along when the process is complete if anyone is interested. Thank you. 


Open discussion

Thanks a lot, kadia, also for your nice presentation, and it's now time for question. So, as mentioned, I ask you to for the speakers please turn on your camera and for the audience. You can put your questions in the chat and please indicate if the question is for one of the specific speakers or more. We already have a question in the chat, so I'm going to read it's for you. 
So the question is: there are obvious advantages of virtual studies. However, the ecological validity is heavily discussed where you. able to somehow validate results. Thank you for the question. I think the question is about ecological validity. When we are talking VR is it's a topic that we need to discuss? 
Actually, I would say the we are using we in evacuation enironment have been popular than before and the lots of research how done lots of work to compare the human behavior in VR and in real scenarios, and the previous have done lot of work to show actually people will make similar R choice or decision making in Virtual environment. 
And when it come to my research, I would say, for example, in the first example, we additional use the data from another data set to validate our hypo processes. Sometimes it works, but sometimes not, because it's not always easy to get a similar data set from another environment. but I would just say this U meth method have been supported by P research on the ecological valid. We are especially in evacuation study. Thank you, thanks you. 
This is indeed a very known debated questions in our field. For those of us that work with VR H. I have a question for the first speaker for oain, so maybe we can take that first and I find very interesting approach. I'm familiar with the work that you have been doing, also because some of my colleagues in Lun have been involved, and I have a question which is more linked. 
Like I understand, this is, let's say, a first attempt to go into this kind of microscopic understanding of people movement. But what about more complex scenarios like, for instance, it's easy to look a step extent in 1D, but already if we go in 2D or if? we think about staircases, even in 3D, I mean it might be more complex to look at this. 
Have you put some thoughts about this or is there any, let's say, ideas that you had and how much this work that you have been doing can be extended to more complex? Guess was saying yeah, actually, to design the experiments, the first idea was to remove the complex, the complex, the complexity, as much as possible, and there reason for single five scenarios. 
Was that so, by removing the complexities like overtaking, like having two, three, four lines and like having stairs, we could understand what is the relation relationship between the step extent and the speed and how people take the steps when they are in a congested area. But we also had some wider flu scenarios and by characterizing that we could understand: okay, they may not be. affected from the person directly in front. 
They may be affected by the person in front of that person when they have some offset with the person in front. And yeah it can add more complexity and the model can be different if we add those things. But the first idea was just developing for more simple scenarios and then going ahead and developing for wider flow and other complex situations. Thanks for your comments. 
I think it's very reasonable, because I mean we always have to start from something and it's better to, let's say, control what can be confounding factors, and I guess the next stage of research would be to try to figure out more complex situations. I cannot see more questions in the chat, so in the meanwhile I take the opportunity to do a question to the third speaker to kadia, but I urged the. 
Everyone in the audience to write down more questions. I don't want to sound like I'm the only one speaking so very interesting work. It's something that I completely can agree with that we need more standardization in everything that is to do with a vacation, not just the vacation deals. 
But my next question is this, because very often the challenge is not only defining what a standard way of doing things should be, but to make sure the people adopt that standard. So maybe you can think, or you can comment about this, because I mean I know some of the people you work with and I'm sure they put thinking of things. Thinking about this. 
For instance, myself I'm involved in ISO and there is no such standard. So it would be very nice to, let's say, push this kind of idea to a vacation drill reporting. template, but have you thought about that? So How likely do you think this is going to be adopted? 
Not because this has the potential to be adopted, not just, let's say, in the sphere of the national research Council of Canada, right, but it could be having a much wider Outreach. Have you put some thinking into this or thought about some next steps? Hi, first of all, thank you for your question. Yes, that is an interesting question. Our goal with this, hopefully our goal with this, is the intent that the form is easily adaptable. 
I think that one of the key points of this is that we don't expect the form in its entirely entirety to be adapted everywhere. I think every jurisdiction and organization has its own sort of regulatory and legal requirements, so we've kind of presented the form as a sort of starting. point I think in terms of next steps. Digitization is probably a good Next Step, because I think that there are. 
We had in some of our interviews. We had some of officers talk about how they wish that they could seamlessly sort of integrate this with like an online ticket system. 
So I think the challenge here really is, and something to think about is you know getting the word out, so to speak, that you know there has been a process that has been done and we do have this template and just take a look at it and you might notice some things that may have fallen through the cracks, and so I think that's the real challenge here, but hopefully, once this paper is published, we'll be able to get that out. 
But yeah, I think I think I'm not sure. Did I answer that? question. I think it's a good starting point. I don't know if any of your cter have more thoughts on this, but I would be very keen in trying to push something like this in like one of the standardization organization like ISO or similar organizations, because this is exact the type of efforts that we need. 
I mean someone that, let's say, raise the questions of inconsistency in what we are doing in a given area, means that yeah, we need to have a standard, and but again, the standard will be can be the best standard in this world, but if it's not used, then it's not a standard. 
So the main mission is indeed to try to push it forward, but this is a very good U initial step, so I really appreciate the efforts that you did together with your colleagues as mentioned, feel free to. anyone that wants to make more questions, either in the chat or you're also free to ask if you want to ra turn on your mic and ask otherwise. 
I have in the meanwhile, another question for Yun this time H, which is more like I. It's very interesting to look at your studies and we saw your VR scenario was very good to see it through the. You know the actual scene in this virtual reality game and one thing I notices was it's mostly people walking and doing way findings, but there is no real threat, right. 
So like there is no fire or whatever other threat, at least visually present. So my question was more like how do you think this will you think would relate to a crowd evacuation scenario, so not just a way finding task. So when you have a threat, yeah, sorry. can repeat question again. 
So I mean in your scenario we could see that you had people moving around and doing wave, finding task, but it was no real threat. Right there is no, there was no fire there, no smoke. Do you think, for instance, the fact of avoiding the crowd will be consistent in a scenario where you have a threat, so maybe want to stick to the familiar or you want to stick to other people? 
Or do you think that's something that you can generalize also to scenarios where the threat is directly visible? Actually, I don't know. I think you mention the last like it kind of like a temp pressure. When people have different levels of temp pressure, their motivation will change and they have different choice in our environment. We just give the instuction like you have to get out to the building. as quickly as possible. 
We don't mention anything about the threat. That means maybe the thre not strong and they don't have very strong motivation to the choice. But I think if we change, you know, increase the Strat, they will perform or behave in a different way. Thanks, un. I can see in the chat and also in the Q&A some questions. There is one from aruro for the third speaker for kadia. Well done this. 
Have you considered potential response biases, such as non response bias or recall bias, and how to solve or address this in the future? Yes, hi, so thanks for your question. I just wanted to ask for a clarification. Do you mean in terms of the responses we had for the surveys before? I think that's what our toura means like that's what they mean. Okay, yes, so we have considered the biases. 
So like non response bias for examples we emitted. We admitted survey responses that were incomplete from our analysis, so we didn't include those. Additionally, we had recall. Bias is a concern, because we did. We did these during the pandemic. So we asked them to recall in our scenario, asked them, we provided them a scenario with some basic details and then asked them to you know whatever details we emitted recall a recent evacuation to that end. 
We recorded. We asked them specifically when was the last evacuation you had been in, so addressing the possibility of the pup. Yes, there is that concern. Of course we are not really so we sort of had to go on best. We had participants who were experts and participants who were officers, so not everybody had the same sort of responses in terms of when they had last completed an. evacuation, for example. 
Of course, I think to address this concern we would have to run more and run more surveys with a larger number of participants to sort of validate the results to that extent. So I think conducting another sort of larger scale survey would hopefully sort of shed light on and address those concerns. I hope that answered the questions, or thanks, KY. I think this is a good answer. 
I there is one last two, actually more question, but I take one of the two also for y in the Q&A. So max Ked is curious to know about your thoughts about pre planning route and habits. How do those they interact with each other? So, for example, the people that commute routinely the same way to work but then they might deviate from the route based on traffic. So what do you think about? 
Habit versus pre plan. How will this relate to way F find. I think the pre planning the route is some kind the represent their habit in some cases. In reality, just like they have already take their regular can be their pre plan route. And also Max mention that the commu to work like they may diate from their Planet rout. 
I think it will become more complex because if the alternative route will take shorter time for you to reach the destination, it will be different. It's involves utility. So our survey is just imaginary question just to make a choice between a stick to plan rout or alternative. So I think yeah, some kind is u a kind of like habit pre plant. But in reality it's more complex also. 
I just want to give a short answer on makx, another question about the do WS actually. in the third example, we just consider the social influence. So we just focus on the contextual factors about the crow, the crow Split Crow size. So where the D is also important. Yeah, I know it's important, but we only consider social influence. Thank you, thanks you. 
I have one last question forain and then I think we should wrap up, because we are already two minutes over time h i. I just want to know if you put some thoughts on how, and I know in the crowd there of audience, there is some people that work on this what happens when you have, in this model, a population that is different than, let's say, adult standard students, like young and healthy students, like if you have a person in a wheelchair or if you have children? Have you put some thoughts on this, on how widely? 
Generalizable will be to different type of populations. I know that it's as you said you don't want you want to start from something simpler, but maybe you put some thoughts already on this. Yeah, as I mentioned, the model is not developed fully, but some FES and I try to develop that for the single file movement of older people using some external data. 
Actually we tried to consider the biomechanics of movement and the space that each person occupied. So usually it's based on the ability of taking steps and based on the space occupied at each moment and for all their adults or disabled adults, they can take a steps, but maybe the maximum occupied space of them is different with younger adults and there are some literature on that in not transportation of fire journals but in biomechanics journals like G posture or some different journals. Rel to biome mechanics. So is it the answer? 
Or yeah, I think it's. It's good that you start reflecting on this and what's the way forward for the model. So I think it's time to wrap up. Also, because we are four minutes over time. I just want to take one more time, the opportunity to thank the three speakers, hin, Yun and kadya, as mentioned. We are very happy to have had this event with the harly career researchers. 
We will try to arrange another one as well to give the opportunity to more early career researchers to share their work with the unb fire Community. With this I wrap up for today, and I thank everyone as well that followed this webinar and that keep following our webinar series, and as you know, we will post the recordings of this webinar on our YouTube channel that Arthur. has kindly shared in the chat. So thanks everyone and see you at the next webinar, byebye. Thank you very much. Yeah, great job, everyone it's.
