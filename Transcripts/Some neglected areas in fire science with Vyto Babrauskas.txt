 Hello everybody, welcome to Fire Science Show Session 43. I'm super happy to tell you that today I'm hosting a true legend of fire safety and fire science, Professor Vitanis Babrauskas. Vito is well known in the community, he's been active in fire safety for I think last five decades. He's supposedly the first PhD in fire safety engineering, which is an amazing, an amazing title, and an author of absolutely landmark handbooks, such as the Ignition Handbook and more recently Electrical Fires and Explosions Handbook. fire engineers in their profession. And more than that, he's also been involved in the development of the tools that we all use, such as cone calorimetry or furniture calorimeters, and many, many more. It's actually quite difficult to list all the achievements of his long and fruitful career. Anyway, we all know Vito, and I've invited him to the podcast to discuss his views on where the fire science is lacking or what are the white spots in fire science, because that was very interesting to me. And given he has such a long professional career, I wondered if the problems we meet today or the unresearched areas we find today were also identified already 30, 40 years ago and why the fire science has not picked on them. Actually, I think this is a quite interesting conversation that touches both the history and the future of fire safety. And many of the topics may be a little controversial or may sound controversial, but I think it's okay. We need diverse voices and sometimes you need to listen to some harsh words to move forward. So I also appreciate that. Also, what's interesting in conclusions, Vito is going back to some very simple guidance, which sounds like obvious. We need to do cost-benefit analysis. We need to have better statistics we need to have well clarified goals that are written in the law for performance-based engineering i mean these things are on the first thought you would think they're not very deep and they're like very obvious then again if you think we for first thing we don't have them, which is horrible. And the second thing, well, he's talking from five decades of experience doing that. So this gives these thoughts this additional depth to truly consider them and maybe stop a while and think about it. And I think it's a very worthy thing. So I think this does not require any more introduction. I hope I got your attention already and you're ready to listen to the interview. If you'd like to learn about Professor Bobrowska and his books and other stuff that he's providing, you can visit him at his webpage drfire.com. And for this talk, well, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski, and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Firesense Show. I'm today with Dr. Vitanis Babrauskas. Hello, Vito. I'm so happy to have you in the show. Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity to share whatever I can of my experience and my points of view within the profession. Thank you so much. I really enjoy having people who are leaders of the industry in here. And I really like for some reason to talk about people's PhDs. And you happen to be the first fire protection engineering PhD. And I would like to come back actually to the times when you've done that. I have happened to seen big parts of that. And the reason why I ask you about it is that some time ago, there was a paper by John Gales. John was actually on this podcast around episode 10, talking about it and about the historical origins of fire testing. And many of that work was based on your work for your PhD and the papers that were published in 70s in fire technology. But now with this new paper, you wrote a letter to editor. And obviously the letter and critique is interesting, but there is one sentence that has made me call you and get you on the show, because I find it brilliant. I will cite it. You write about historic origins and then a sentence. Even though we did not explicitly state this, it was basically felt in that space of a short year's fire resistance, testing would become an obsolete anachronism. Wow, mind broken. Was that the state of your mind in like 70s that it's going to go up? Because boy, it did not. Well, it was not, you know, actually, it wasn't in my personal opinion, but that was the opinion of the professors that I worked with and their colleagues. And it was felt that, you know, science is going to triumph technology and that things will become very scientific. But what I want to tell you, the story, which is very interesting, one big aspect of that is thermostructural behavior and thermostructural modeling. And you see, when I was at Berkeley in the 1970s, we had one of the people who was in my guidance committee was Professor Boris Bressler, and was a very famous man in structural engineering and fighter engineering. And he had a number of graduate students who built up the first really significant suite of computer programs for calculating thermostructural behavior of building frames. Because frames was the emphasis, because a two-by-four house does not have frames, but people worry less about that. They worry more about bigger buildings. And he was very progressive. Those students were very good. And so by the middle of the 1970s, we had this capability to go to a computer and calculate structurally what happens to building frames when fire happens upon them. Now, the very fascinating thing after that is, I don't know if you know in Europe, this story of Rip Van Winkle, where this was this man who went to sleep and then he slept for 20 years and he woke up 20 years later. Well, the same thing happened in thermostructural design. And it was extremely bizarre that after Professor Bresser retired, I think around 1980, but ever since, you know, these students finished in, I think, 75, 76, something like that. sleeping. And they had made this absolutely major scientific advance. And for the next 20 years, absolutely nothing happened. And then about 20 years later, about in the middle of 1990s, people started saying, oh, well, wait a minute, there's some science possible that you could compute what happens to a structure of a building when there's a fire in it. And so why this 20-year pause happened is, I have no explanation, It's just very strange. But then the second thing happened, which I think is also strange, is that now if you look in our fire science journals, I think generally the number one most popular topic is fire resistance modeling and various calculations or in some cases experiments and calculations on beams and columns and joints and composite structures and things like that and actually you know because i don't tend to look from a so much a professional point of view i tend to look from a society point of view that i think it's more important to be a member of society than it is to be a professional member. So from a society point of view, I ask this question, is this the right place to put that many financial resources? Because, you know, those people are doing academically good work and they are producing graduate students and the graduate students are earning the Ph.D. degrees and the system is happy that way. But are we really cost effectively making an improvement in fire safety by doing that? improvement in fire safety by doing that. And I don't think so, because I think we are doing very, very small things, very detailed things, which cost a significant amount of money, but the benefits are very small. So in my view, they shouldn't be the things that we are doing. And, you know, I will actually go one step further and talking about the buildings and say, it is very interesting when you look at any kind of science research in the fire safety science profession. Where is this taking place? Well, the overwhelming majority is for big buildings. And, of course, nowadays there is for transport also, for tunnels, things like that. But in buildings, overwhelmingly, it is for big buildings. You know, like people will write about evacuation models, and the evacuation models are always for some high-rise building. Not a single community dwelling. Yeah, exactly. But if you look at the American statistics, and I think in any country in the world, they're pretty similar, The bulk of fire deaths are within people's houses, not within big buildings. So it's obviously very important to keep big buildings safe, because if there is a big fire, there'll be a big disaster. But the point is that we need even more emphasis on houses, because that is where, if you are going to be the unfortunate victim who will die in a fire overwhelmingly that is most likely to be you know something like 80 percent will be in a house not in a big building so one of the things that i will go back in my profession and tell you a little bit about a name which you probably have never heard of, Dr. Bud Levin. And Bud Levin, when I went to work for NIST in 1977, Bud Levin was already there. He had been there a couple of years. I don't know when he started, but he was a PhD psychologist, and he was working on the human behavior aspects in fires. And what he realized in that late 1970s, very early 1980s, is that the most important area where he can make an impact is on human behavior in houses. And so he wrote a very early model called EXIT, and it's E-X-I, but then there's two letters T, T-T. And that was a very early model of how you evacuate a house. But what he realized is that it's not a simple thing because he was a psychologist, so he knew about some things about how people behave. And he knew that if, you see, most evacuation models assume that as soon as there is a fire alarm, that there are people who will progress either walking or running at a high speed from where they are to the exit. and what Dr. Levin discovered when he studied actual incidents of fires and what happened in these fires. And he worked together with also very now, I think, so much forgotten, Professor John Bryan at the University of Maryland. He's a little bit more remembered, I think, today. And Professor Bryan was a fire protection engineer, but they both shared this interest and they both did this work. Let's find out how people evacuate and how they behave in the fire and evacuation being part of how they behave in a fire. And what Bud Levin started finding out, and Professor Bryan also found out, is that it's very complex. Is that usually when there's a fire in your house, say, you do not run from the fire, you run towards the fire. So the first step is to run towards the fire and you investigate and then you may or may not take action, depending on what you find from the investigation. And then you make some decisions, and only then do you take the next step, which may be several different choices. And so we had in the 1970s and 1980s, we had these studies of what happens in fires, which are statistically the important fires, namely in houses. And then after about mid-1980s, we have forgotten that. And I went and looked through a couple of years ago, we had a series of these symposia called Human Behavior and Fires, which are very specialized. They're important scientific conferences. And they have published all the papers and you can look through the papers and you can find out what people were studying. And people were overwhelmingly studying fires not in residential houses. So it's like this stories of how, you know, the policeman and the drunk on the street and the drunk is stumbling around and he's looking for something. And the policeman says, you know, what are you doing? And the man says, well, I'm looking for something. And the policeman says, you know, what are you doing? The man says, well, I'm looking for something. And the policeman says, what are you looking for? The man says, I lost my keys. And the policeman says, where did you lose them? And the man says, over in these bushes. And the policeman says, well, why are you looking under the street lamp? And the man says, well, because the light is good there. And, you know, so that's a traditional joke of the stupid man who is looking in the wrong place. But as researchers, I think we need to understand this joke and use it appropriately that we should not be doing research under the street lamp just because the light is good there. We should be doing research where it's needed, not where it's easy and convenient to do. Now, you know, I do want to say that I'm not accusing people personally of acting unwisely because often it is the funding institutions that are the problem. on human behavior in houses, then of course the professors will study the former, not the latter, because that's what they can get paid to do. But, you know, we need to think about our funding processes because the houses are where we are losing people. And so why we're spending proportionately less effort and less money now in 2022 on this problem than we were in 1970s and 1980s. And I think that's very strange,earth problems like fires in houses. I think that's the time where the smoke sensors became a thing in houses. That's around the time where house sprinklers were invented. So there has been a lot of innovation in this regard. And then some sort of fork happened. The industry has split into like parallel worlds, maybe even more than two. One following the fire resistance and doing business as usual, testing things, applications. Other being a world of science and engineering where you would use big world of science and engineering where you would use big word performance-based engineering to design your perfect system cutters for a certain occupancy or certain building. And now I think we're in this awkward acrobatics where we try to merge this somehow together. We tried to do that. We tried to join performance-based engineering and fire testing, for example, to improve on the fire testing because we see where it is lacking more than ever. And also because on how fundamental it became for modern industry, it's not something you can just replace that easily because it's at the cornerstone of every single building being built. Well, let me say a few words about performance-based engineering, because back in the late 1990s, I actually wrote, I think it was a series of three papers on that topic, because I was very concerned about what was happening. And the context of that was that at that time, you know, many countries around the world were setting up systems of performance-based design for fire safety. And I was selected to be a U.S. representative into the process that Japan was doing to establish a performance-based guidelines over there. performance-based guidelines over there. So I got to see things very intimately, not just from United States, not just from learning of foreign countries activities, but actually from participating in that process in a country different from mine. And I got to be very concerned. And Japan happened to be a very bright, positive exception to what I saw. But what in the, everywhere else in the world that I looked at, and I think that UK was the worst from what I could see, though, and examine every country's activities, things were in bad shape. And let me just sort of tell you a little bit about what the problems were. The performance-based design is sort of by itself kind of a neutral process. It can be good, bad, or indifferent. But what I realized very soon is that what you really need to focus on is what are the criteria for assessing this performance-based design. And so the two extremes I will point out is the one that they were developing in Japan versus in the UK. In Japan, what they said I thought was just perfect. And what they said, I thought was just perfect. What they said is there's a fire safety pie and we'll divide the pie into slices. In other words, subsystems of fire safety, you know, like fire resistance, smoke, the notification systems, et cetera, et cetera. And we will establish a performance based criterion for each particular subsystem. Now, we will allow you, the designer, to make designs of various kinds according to various principles and ideas. But when you have made a design, there's going to be some sort of quantitative rule or formula for each pie slice, how to assess whether you have succeeded in having a minimum acceptable performance achieved in that design. So that was the idea in Japan, and I thought that's how things should happen. Well, in the UK, they took the extreme opposite approach. They actually wrote into the preface of their document saying that the client, meaning the architect, developer, whoever wants to build this building, and the government official shall sit down and together decide on a level of safety as the starting point of the process. And I thought to myself, this must be one of the many definitions of insanity. Because there is no way that a reasonable society should tolerate this. I mean, the same thing as if you were to say, well, I have just badly beaten up some person. well, I have just badly beaten up some person, okay? So me and the policeman will get together, and we will decide on the acceptable level of beating a citizen. And then we will go from there. I think most people realize that is not okay. In other words, in the English-speaking world, we have had a long history where we say that the rule of men, and no dishonor to women here, but that's traditional old-time statement, the rule of men has been replaced by the rule of law. by the rule of law. And that was in England way back many centuries ago when the king first allowed a parliament to be formed and for the citizens to actually have some input into how the laws are written. That it's not just the king shall say that I like you, therefore I will give you money. I don't like you, therefore I will put you in prison. Instead, we have a system of laws that tell us what can be done and what cannot be done. Well, in my view, what the British concept was to reverse this thousand years or whatever of legal progress and to go back to the role of men before there was a rule of law. I view that as total craziness. But so, you know, nowadays, performance-based design, what comes down to is the conscience of the practitioner. In other words, if you are an honest person intending to do a good safety job, you and you are working in a performance-based design system, then you are likely to do some really inappropriate things. Now, you know, what people on the opposite side will tell me, well, yeah, that may be true, but we have a peer review system that if you make a performance-based design, we'll send this out to a peer reviewer. Yeah. I say that really is not okay because, again, it's extremely based on personalities that in most cases what will happen is that people do not want to criticize somebody else's professional work because they feel that tomorrow will be, tables will be turned. But also with the peer review, if you are not clear about the goals or expectations, if they are not strict, what are you pre-reviewing? Are you pre-reviewing someone's skill in performing CFD, or are you really interviewing the safety that is being delivered on the building? Yeah, exactly. And the peer review is just a part of the process, and the issue is not with it being there or not, but the goals not being defined, right? Yeah, absolutely. being there or not, but the goal is not being defined, right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so, you know, that I think is one. And you see, it rather surprised me that I thought that when public in the late 1990s made a bunch of noise on this topic, I thought that there would be other people, that this would promote a dialogue and promote a lot of discussion within the profession. But that did not happen. So I went on to doing other things. I can't just sort of keep beating on something, but I thought we did not have a very good resolution to that. And, you know, the way things are in the U.S. today is that it's an interesting situation because performance-based design is not used a great deal. I mean, it is certainly known and accepted, but it's not used a great deal. Where it is used primarily is for very big projects. And for very big projects, And for very big projects, you generally really do need to use that because the prescriptive codes, you know, if you're going to design a sports arena or you're going to design an airport terminal or giant projects like that, that prescriptive codes are really not designed to cope very well with that type of a project. People naturally tend to need to use performance-based design. But, you know, what mostly is okay because there are the people who get the very big projects are very well-known firms, very well-established firms, and they tend to have decent people there who are very concerned about their reputation, very concerned about the firm's reputation, and try to do a very honest and correct job. But you see, what was the feeling back in the 1990s is that this thing would percolate all the way down to much smaller projects, which I don't know about other countries, but, you know, in the U.S. that has not happened. I'll tell you how it is. In Poland, it's quite interesting because we have a very, like a very strict prescriptive code. Our code is super, but there's one little point in it where it says that the smoke control should be designed so it provides sufficient conditions for evacuation of people. And that's a performance-based design statement in a prescriptive code that opened the whole world of performance-based design in smoke control, obviously based around ACET-RCEP concept, which you were already kind to criticize in one of the papers that I know. But it did democratize performance-based design up to even the smallest projects. So wherever you have smoke control, and you know that it is maybe unwise to design it letter by letter by the code because it's inefficient in that matter, economically inefficient, you can optimize it quite well with the performance-based design. So this came back all the way down to all of the projects. And now today, it is just a part of engineering. It's not anymore performance-based engineering. It's engineering. We engineer smoke control systems. is just a part of engineering. It's not anymore performance-based engineering. It's engineering. We engineer smoke control systems. We have a set of goals and we achieve them. And in a way, I think this is efficient, but it also opened a lot of dead ends, a lot of traps for people. Because when competitors could compete on the design of the systems anymore, they started competing about design fires or sooth-heal ratios. If I make simulations for my building with 10 megawatts and you do yours with 2 megawatts and your sooth-heal is for ethanol and I do polyurethane foam, well, your system is certainly better than mine. Right? So in this loop, we've lost this, or maybe we never had this capability, you know, to control the beast. The beast was unleashed. And as with your policeman and the drunk man, it started looking in the places where it was brighter or in the places where it was easiest, not necessarily in the places where it should have been. So that's fascinating. in the places where it should have been. So that's fascinating. I also know that you are largely involved in the whole of your career in forensics litigation. And I also assume that much of your work is inspired by the tragedies that happened and seeking a way out. And I've listened to some of your talks recently about the ammonium nitrate and electrical fires as well. So was it also something that was fueling research in, let's say, 70s, 80s, and you maybe do not see it now? Or what's your perspective? Well, you know, we basically learn almost nothing from real fires, and that to me is tragic. There has to be, to learn from real fires, there has to be some mechanisms for doing that. And we don't have those mechanisms. So what I think, learning from fires, you could sort of divide into two categories. Learning from very important fires or learning from routine fires. Those are kind of two ways of looking at it. Now, the one thing that to me is very interesting, and again, speaking from the U.S., if we have an airplane that falls down from the sky, we have a government agency called NTSB, which goes and has technical people that investigate that accident in great detail and find out what happened, why it happened, how to prevent it. They write reports. They have dialogue with the affected manufacturers. It's a very well-developed system. But if we have a major fire that takes place in the United States, we have absolutely no such system. such system. We nowadays typically what happens in response to the fire is that we have a federal agency called Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that comes in and investigates. But they are kind of an interesting agency because they're primarily a criminal investigation agency and they generally do not make any kind of a report on what they do. They disappear and make a report which you cannot get. So that does not really help anybody, and especially if there is no crime, then it doesn't even help put anybody in prison, and we have nothing else. But this is the major fires and what about the bulk of fires the ones that you said they're 80 percent residential? And for those we also don't have anything. Now what I'm going to tell you a little bit about the forensic practice in the U.S. and tell you what I think should be done. You see in the U.S. if you have just any, not a major fire, but any kind of a fire that is non-trivial, what will happen is that usually the building is insured. So the first thing that will happen, however, is the fire department will come and deal with the fire. And then there will be typically a lieutenant or a captain in the fire service who will write a report, and that will be the statistical report. If it's a slightly bigger fire, there will be, in addition to the statistical report, there will be a textual report, a narrative report, and that is usually there will be a different type of personnel, a fire investigator or arson squad or people like that, that will be sent out to do that. But even the specialized person from the fire department, even if it's a significant fire, you know, unless there is just a giant loss of life, typically they will, you know, spend maybe three or four hours and write their report. Now, if it's a bigger fire, the next thing that will happen is that there will be an insurance company or companies involved, and they will send a private fire investigators. And the private fire investigator may spend four days rather than four hours at the fire scene because they will be asked to find out the details of what happened, and their budget is usually much bigger than the budget at the fire department, so they don't have to run away after four hours. fire department so they don't have to run away after four hours. They can investigate more carefully and on the basis of that make a report. And it's usually a professional detailed report. The problem with that is that unless you're a forensic expert like me and you show up in a courtroom, nobody ever sees that report. So if you don't see anything, you can't learn from it. Now, what I have suggested to the profession, which people have not listened to, but still it's a good suggestion, is that there's an easy way to fix this. We have a number of insurance companies in America, and they are generally big corporations, and they are generally long-term. In other words, they don't start up and shut down and disappear in the middle of the night. They're generally invested in the long term. So they're around for a long time now. What they consider is that report is proprietary and it simply goes into a file folder where nobody else can see it. industry should get together and say that we can improve fire safety if we learn from fires. So what we should do is we should take these reports and we should take away the names and the addresses from there. And then we should find a way to distribute that information and make it publicly available and do some form of aggregation, compilation, analysis, so that the people could learn and the safety could be improved. But that is not happening. happening and the industry in America has actually taken steps backwards because back 50 years ago, the insurance industry used to have something called the National Board of Fire Underwriters. And they were a technical arm of the fire insurance business. And they had engineers, they had technical people, they had resources, they published things, they investigated things, and they published things. And it wasn't a major effort, but still it was an effort. And that disappeared. In other words, they closed that activity down. They just merged it into the purely lobbying kind of organization. There is no more anything of that work that National Board of Fire Underwriters used to do. They have computers for that now. Yeah, that's right. They did not have computers in the 1960s, but they were able to do that. So this would be a way forward. The insurance business is very widespread, you know, generally it's not localized to one area or one type of building or anything like that. So the same thing that company A learns, company B learns, and company C learns, there is nothing special in what you can learn as company B. So that kind of information, I think, should be shared on an industry basis, but it's not. So I would urge anybody that you should try to make some steps that your fire insurance companies should make some society or group or something where they can share information that takes away names and addresses but allows technical learning to take place. I will again tell you how we, in a way, went there. I will again tell you how we, in a way, went there. I'm not representing an insurer, but I represent a fire laboratory, which also deals with the same issue, having a knowledge that's forbidden because it's proprietary. And we've been there. We've done that on facades. We took reports. We've anonymized them so we don't put any bad name over any of the companies that we have served. But from that bulk of knowledge, some patterns emerge and some important knowledge can emerge that in fact leads to better design of systems and no harm can come out of there. Because if you are a company that manufactures something and that something causes a huge building to burn down, you're not going to have a great business either. So finding these issues earlier can actually not only save lives and environment, but also actually work in favor of the business of those who would be in their first thoughts hiding the information. those who would be in their first thoughts hiding the information. And I think this issue is probably as old as the fire engineering, the ability to get into data and collect it and sort it and make it meaningful, like finding ways how you could really, really use it, in fact. And I'm really glad that at least from the science perspective, organizations like NIST or UL, they're openly sharing their data. I mean, not from litigations, but from experiments. And this is a very well-welcomed thing. You've also provided with additional handbook data which could be used. And this is also a very well-received item. I know many people actually bought the book for the data with all the knowledge. But this is also a very well-received item. I know many people actually bought the book for the data with all the knowledge. But that is true. You need good data to support your engineering. And in these few decades of your career, do you think we are improving in the ways how we collect and gather data or we're running circles like chickens? Well, the data systems are quite different in each country, and I have only had the opportunity to study the data system in America. And you see, we, over the 1980s, they progressively instituted and developed our data system. It's called NFIRS, N-F-I-R-S, The data system is called NFIRS, N-F-I-R-S, National Fire Information. I forget what the rest of the letters stand for. Before that, we had nothing really other than NFPA used to very anecdotally collect data very non-systematically. But this became a systematic collection effort. But one thing that I feel, and I've written about that, a whole area that is neglected is the one question that a fire information data system can ask is how effective are the fire departments in their activities? And the NFIRS system in America has never been designed to ask those kinds of questions. So obviously we can't get any answers because those questions are not asked. But I think you could be improving the system by asking questions that would allow you to make some statistical analysis of how successful our fire departments in dealing with their fires. And I do not know why that question was never raised, but it was never raised. You know, in Australia, back, I would say now about 20 years ago, they did some research, did some specific research in order to develop something that's called Fire Brigade Intervention Manual. And what they did is they said that the activities of the fire primarily run against the clock. In other words, it takes so long to do each separate task. So what they did in Australia is they said, let us make some sort of ad hoc studies and determine how long it takes to bring up a ladder and raise it to the third floor or something like that. And how long does it take to bring a fire hose down to the basement and charge it and start putting water on the fire that's in the basement? Those kinds of questions, and the Australians actually tried to answer that. But they were going to sort of keep revising that that was going to be a living document, and near as I can tell, that kind of never happened. I think those kinds of things do differ quite a bit country by country because how a fire department is organized and how it responds in Germany is obviously different from what's happening in Australia. So you really need to do this on a national basis. And, I mean, in my own country, you know, it's a very rich country, a big country. Why is it that we have taken no interest in studying on some engineering basis how fire departments operate? You know, it's crazy that we haven't done that. Actually, you're looking at the holistic picture of fire, with firefighter being a part of the environment. I had Brian Mitchum in this podcast as well. He expressed the view that our system is built under the expectation that someone will come in and save the building, which may not necessarily be the best way to design a safe building. Maybe the building should save itself. Actually, Brian probably will kill me. I probably twisted his words a lot. Dear listeners, please go listen to what Brian said in Brian's episode because I'm not great at copying that. However, I know in my practice, the case of firefighters coming and rescuing and saving the building is something that we also include in our performance-based analysis you know there are people who calculate how much time it will take for firefighters to come to decide how many minutes so they end up their calculations at that minute because at the point the responsibility is on the firefighters not on the systems at all but now you bring the case we don't really know. We do not have real-life statistics on how efficient this arrival, water delivery, whatever it was, was in fact. And more to that, arriving at the skyscraper or all floor-down car park with deep underground does not really mean they've started action it just means they came to the site and it will be different for different buildings and here again we are at the goals of fire engineering that if you view it holistically you need to understand what will happen the building in fire that i find it really fascinating. Well, I also know this data does not exist. I do not have access to such data, and it would be spectacular to have it. Well, you know, you make a very good point about the expectation of fire service performance, because that's entirely correct, and I have not seen that discussed anywhere in my country. And you see that the big issue here in the United States is that there's a very big difference between cities and very sparsely populated rural areas. That if you live in a city and your house catches fire, you can expect the fire department to show up, say, within six minutes. Now, maybe they don't in some cases, but generally that would be a fairly typical expectation. If you are on a remote farm somewhere and you have a volunteer fire department, it may take 45 minutes for somebody to show up there. Now, if the fire department comes up after 45 minutes, the only thing they can do is irrigate a smoldering foundation. I mean, there's absolutely nothing useful they can do, even though they feel professionally obligated to go and put on this demonstration of action. We know that or we shouldn't know that. I mean, anybody, you don't have to be a fire safety expert to figure out that that's the reality. So if that's the case, why have we not required, say, fire sprinklers in all newly built rural houses ever since the 1970s? I have no answer to that, but it's a good question to ask, because if the fire department is not going to protect you and if they take 45 minutes, they are not going to protect you. That sprinkler system would be really worth the money that it costs to put it in. I think you've put that in past that we don't really go into cost benefit analysis. really go into cost-benefit analysis. Like, the cost of the sprinkler installation in a new house in a rural area, of course, it exists and it would be some amount of dollars. But benefits of that, if you take the 45 minutes arrival, are insane. It's the difference between a small ring foundation and a house that smells bad. That's the difference. Foundation versus a bad smell. So, i think this this cost benefit or this effectiveness is also not something visible in the overall system and again i i wonder how did you how did this evolve in this in the history that you observe and how disappointed are you with it? Well, you know, I think it's absolutely bizarre and unacceptable would be maybe a better term. Yeah. My profession has never paid any interest to cost-benefit ratios of any strategies. the cost-benefit ratios of any strategies. And I think it's come from some sort of maybe innate arrogance point of view. In other words, that people saying fire safety is so very, very, very important that the amount of money spent should be ignored. I think that is incorrect because for anything, the money spent is important because there's never an infinite sum of money available to do things. And you always, if you spend money on some one thing, you don't have money to spend on another thing. money on some one thing, you don't have money to spend on another thing. So it's never appropriate to say that we should just ignore how much money something costs. But, you know, I've watched the building code process in the U.S. ever since the 1970s. And the cost-benefit ratio simply does not come in the building code discussions or building code provisions that are accepted. And I think just a single professional speaking my own opinions, but I think that is very wrong. We should consider and we should reject proposals that have a poor benefits compared to the cost. And we should really promote proposals that have low cost and high benefits. But we're not doing that. And why are we not doing that? You know, there are a few exceptions, like, for instance, the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the U.S., for some of their regulations, they actually commissioned a cost-benefit studies or industry went in and commissioned cost-benefit ratio studies. But those have been extremely few examples. And in the building codes, actually, because the Consumer Product the Commission is something separate. It's not related to our building codes. In the building codes process, you just do not see that. And nor in the NFPA codes. The codes are more like worldwide. There's a lot of other countries that use them in addition to America. And we do not see the issue of cost-benefit coming into there. And I think that is really wrong, that we should be doing that. And I hope that people start getting smarter enough to accept it. There are a lot of places where we overspend money on fighter safety. But there are also places where we don't spend enough. A program to retrofit certain buildings with sprinklers would have a positive benefit-cost situation. But people generally don't push for that. So it's not all just going one way, but it's, you know, costs are just ignored. And that's unfortunate. For us, I always bring the case of excessive amounts of fire resistant walls, for example, like you don't really need four hour fire rated walls in the office. Office fire does not last that long. It's conservation of energy. I'm sorry. There's many cases in which we would overspend because something is written in the code. And often in the code, it was written because you need to have progressive increase of the requirements. So this one is one hour, two hours. Okay, this one should be four without any big proof. Or, you know, someone in the 70s said something and suddenly for the next 50 years we're doing like that in my field in smoke control you would not believe how many times in the discussions in the european commission when we try to figure out why something is in place we end up in a statement that howard morgan said so and no one ever questioned because it was howard morgan who said that so it was truth i really i really wonder how many things like this exist in our system. And actually, no, I'm actually scared because probably a lot. And now you mentioned there are solutions that could add safety. Just two or three episodes ago, I had engineer Inger Reiss from Switzerland who's dealing with tunnels. Switzerland, who's dealing with tunnels. And he said many, many smart things that maybe you should not overinvest in the safety of a tunnel, which in general is one of the safest places on the road you can be. Like you are more safe in a tunnel than on an open road. And maybe you could take this money and invest it in the safety features in the road network. Because from the network operator perspective, not a tunnel owner, but network perspective, this is a well-invested money. And same in here. I had Danielle Antonelli's, her company Kindling, working to make safety as a, not as a privilege, but as a human right, fire safety. And she's helping informal settlements, you know, people in poverty getting safety. And then you think, you know, I'm spending hours and hours doing very fine CFD for this beautiful skyscraper in Warsaw. And then there is one billion people living in poverty who do not have access to any safety. Like, I'm not even talking about sprinklers or fire detection. I'm talking about water and electricity. They may not have access to these simple tools needed to create safety. So from a building perspective, we do not have cost-benefit analysis. But from the system perspective, oh boy, we really do not invest where it's needed. Or that's my feeling sometimes. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, one thing that I would recommend to your people that are listening is that back in 2013, I published this paper called Some Neglected Areas in Fire Safety Engineering. And that is freely available because it's published in this journal called Fire Science and Technology from Tokyo, and it's freely available. You don't have to pay to download it. And I think even though it is now nine years ago, I think, well, very unfortunately, I don't see that anything positive has changed from what I wrote back then. So I think people, I'm not knocking my profession. I do want to say that. In other words, I think fire safety engineering has made big progress in the last so many decades. So it is a profession that has done improvements, but there are certain areas where you basically, you cannot have an improvement unless you focus on needing the improvement. And so my suggestion to people was to be aware of some areas which are really neglected and omitted and overlooked and see if we can raise a little bit of consciousness that a cost-effectiveness is, well, I'll just tell you what those five areas were that I wrote about. Okay, one is learning from fire incidents in a systematic way. We already talked about that, that the biggest role would be insurance companies, but also government investigation of big fires. And we don't have either of that in the U.S. Studying fires in residential houses. why did we start with that yeah yeah why did we study that in 70s and 80s and stop after that collecting statistics which are meaningful so you know this this will be very different from different countries but i think certainly collecting statistics on how effective is your fire department versus the fire department some other place would be useful developing cost effective codes and standards we just talked about that and finally we haven't talked about it, but considering the unintended consequences of fire safety provision. Let's do that, yeah. Yeah, let me say a few comments about that. About a decade ago or so, I started to volunteer some of my efforts to an organization called the Green Science Policy Institute. organization called the Green Science Policy Institute. And they basically try to promote a safer environment from a chemistry point of view. And one of the things that they were working with that I decided to help them is on the issue of flame retardants, that the flame retardants have had a very interesting history, that they have gotten to be in some categories to be very widely used and yet of minimal or zero benefit. And so, you know, I'm not saying that flame retardants are useless across the board, but I think they're useful in fewer circumstances than people realize. I think the biggest positive example is electrical circuit boards. I think electrical circuit boards should be made with flame retardant materials. And there's a very simple way to explain the science of that, and that is that these chemical flame retardants are effective if the loading of the chemical is high compared to the size of the flame that is attacking the object. Now, this is not a quantitative statement, but you can find ways of quantitating it in specific circumstances. And so we have this saga in the state of California that they mandated that upholstered furniture have foams, which have chemical flame retardants in them, and without adequately studying whether that is doing anything good. And once people have studied that, they found out that it wasn't doing something useful, and yet there were big negative issues. You know, like, for instance, it shows up in mother's breast milk, which is obviously not a place where you would want. I retarded. It lowers children's IQ. I mean, there's been studies of that sort, which is obviously very undesirable. And then it goes into the water and air and gets into the oceans and all kinds of downstream unintended consequences so there have been big concerns and there have been people that are researching the ecological aspect of that and then they don't have dialogue with the fire science people and the fire science people don't pay any attention to the ecologists. So it's been an interesting situation. And, you know, I was one of the first people to volunteer to actually help the ecologist community because I felt that some personal responsibility that my profession should be doing good. It shouldn't be doing things that have a more negative problem than positive. But it's also a very general issue. You know, we were, our profession was unreservedly recommending asbestos in anything and everything until people found out how dangerous asbestos is. And they never were thinking about the dangers of asbestos before they were happily using it. There's a whole number of examples like that where people focus narrowly on something and say, let's just go and jump and do this without thinking, is there maybe an unintended consequence and that consequence is negative, and maybe that ought to stop you. In your paper you also mention halons and this is something that's fascinating to me because from the first look, halons are magic. They stop the reactions, they stop the fire at the chemical level. We're not even talking about conservation of energy, ignition. No, they stopped the chemistry. But on the second view, and the reason why they are not used anymore, is that they are very disastrous for the oxygen layer. Like, they are as good at stopping fire as they are at destroying the ozone layer. Yeah, ozone, I meant. Okay, I understand that. But now we understand a lot more about the environmental impact of fires. So what is actually worse, a release of a halon that stops fire, or the fire itself with the emits CO2, which emits a lot of many, many different chemicals? So I really wonder if after halons were banned, there was any discussion, what this actually was, having fires or having a release of this substance? Well, you know, halogen was sort of interesting because it was a specialized niche. In other words, you did not have that for protecting houses. In other words, you did not have that for protecting houses, which we had it as for, you know, libraries, computer rooms, fire rooms, some aircraft hangers, you know, things of that sort that were very narrow technical areas. And the halogen solutions were adopted before anybody gave any thoughts that there could be anything negative other than the cost of having to pay for it. And then, you know, that realization came later. But I think today's perspective, what I think should be done, and I'm not seeing being done, is that any proposal of doing anything in fire safety, I think should be evaluated with a cost benefit assessment that, you know, if you're going to have a product standard or a building code regulation or a UL standard of some sort or anything, I think you should consider the cost benefit of what you're proposing. And that is not done. We still, we have not changed that mentality in any way that we adopt fire safety provisions unthinkingly. That just because we think fire is terrible and fire safety is a good thing, therefore, if somebody can convince us that this is a valid fire safety tool, we will use it even though there may be negative aspects and problems with it. And I think, I mean, that is a sign of an immature profession. The immature profession should consider the pluses and the minuses of what people do. And if they just are full of enthusiasm and run away with what they think is a bright idea and do not stop to consider there may be a negative aspect, it suggests immaturity. It suggests that more thinking is required. This is a fantastic summary of this discussion. And actually, I'm very surprised to find that many of the research ideas are coming back. Like you've said that thermal structural behavior modeling went to sleep, and you've also mentioned behavioral psychology, which also now is, that's a beautiful area of our science with so many brilliant people researching. And what's even more fascinating, all these ideas you did, they would also make a great PhD subject today, because we still lack knowledge. It seems every time we move forward, we find more new questions and more new problems to solve, which is maybe not the best concluding statement, but certainly great news for the new generation of fire safety engineers and scientists who come into the profession. And I'm very happy that with your insight into the last few decades of the history of fire science, we could show that many of these things have already been a little bit researched or a lot researched. And you don't have to figure out everything from scratch. You need to seek answers in the past and just build on top of the shoulders of giants. That's a great perspective for young scientists in here. Well, you know, let me sort of follow on that and say one thing. I was very happy when I got to write my Ph.D. dissertation is that my professors in my school let me write a thesis, which is broad rather than narrow. OK. rather than now. Okay. So what I would suggest now to the professors in our field who are having new PhD students, why don't you encourage some young man or woman who is in your office trying to find the best theme for their dissertation, allow them to write a broad topic, where should the fire safety profession focus in the future and make a PhD thesis out of that. And I think that would be hopefully a very positive effort by somebody who would do that, because I think it is worthwhile to raise those kinds of fundamental questions. I think it is worthwhile to raise those kinds of fundamental questions. And if you have smart people, they may be able to give good input. And if you struggle to find a good PhD thesis topic in the neglect areas in fire safety, you have five to pick up and the whole of them will be great. That's like five needed and five possibly great PhDds dr babrauskas thank you very much for joining me in the podcast it was a joy to to speak to you and maybe less joy to find the neglected areas in fire safety but certainly a much needed and appreciated lesson thank you for your time and yeah all the best to you man thank you thank you very much for inviting me and let us hope that profession is able to move well in a positive direction i'm certain that it will thank you so much take care and that's it what a pleasure to talk to a true legend of fire safety it was one of my dreams to be able to interview people like Vito on this podcast, and this is achieved. A lot of credit goes to Elena Funk, a listener who really pushed me to do this interview. Thank you, Elena. That's much appreciated. I needed a push, and here we are after a great talk with Professor Bobrowskas. Vito has certainly brought many interesting views on the profession. And I think they are very relatable. Like, we're not really researching that much residential fire safety, where homes are still the number one place where people die in fires. That's, in a way, astonishing. We still do not have a good organized way to have statistics, organized way to have statistics, and we do not have a way to recuperate the knowledge found in the post-fire investigations. This is horrible. Like, how are we able to act without having this data? When it comes to performance-based design, I guess there may be some split votes in here. I don't think everyone thinks the UK system is not working, but certainly the idea is brought by Vito that well-posed criteria and written in the law, not subject to interpretation, can be a good thing. And I tell you, we have the same in Poland, actually. When the rules are not written in the law and it's up to a person to decide if they're passed or not. It creates issues and I can certainly relate to the issues found or pointed out by Vito. Finally, the problems of cost-benefit analysis and not taking into account the possible negative aspects of fire protection. This is also very, very interesting and as we are living in, let's say, a rich world, we can spend a lot on fire safety. That does not stop us from being responsible to spend that money in the proper places responsibly. it's very important that we put cost-benefit analysis back into the equation of fire safety, hopefully at the level of the guidance law at the top of the pyramid. So it's obvious that you need to do that, not just a nice trick that someone would like to pull. And for this, I would highly recommend to listen to an episode with Ingo Reiss, if you have not already. Because Ingo has shown a very interesting view from tunneling world where this is really being used and I think it's a direction where the whole fire profession can go on so I hope you've enjoyed the interview with Vito tell me what you like about it tell me where you do not agree with Vito, tell me what questions are about it. Tell me where you do not agree with Vito. Tell me what questions are needed to be asked to my future guests to clear out the neglected areas that were brought in life in here. And I also know that many of you are researching actually the areas that Vito touched as the ones that are not researched that much. And I would really, really love to hear from you. If you are there and you do research on some of this, please send me an email and we'll organize an episode. I would love to talk about how you're dealing with them because I would love to hear how the fire safety moves forward, especially in the areas that are possibly very important for the growth of the discipline. So that's it for this little longer than usual episode. I hope you have enjoyed it. I did a lot and one of the bucket list items is crossed now, which makes me very happy. Thank you all for being here. Thanks to Dr. Babrauskas for joining me in this show. And as usual, see you next Wednesday. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
