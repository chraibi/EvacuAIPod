 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today we're gonna talk BIM, that is Building Information Modeling. And I guess half of you are super excited about the topic and the other half has already switched off the podcast hearing these terrifying short letters. It's a subject that people hate, people love, people like, dislike, but it's very difficult to be neutral about it, as it is something that we all are or will be exposed to in future. That's the trend. That's where architecture is going. That's where civil engineering is going. We will have to deal with building information modeling if we like it or not. So I guess it's great to learn about it and see it through the eyes of an expert. And I brought two great experts here today. First is Pete Thompson with GHB and movement strategies. He used to be our guy in Autodesk designing Revit for many years. So he certainly has great knowledge and experience with BIM modeling from the inside. And my second guest is Professor Rino Lavregil, a known pineapple and pizza lover. As a lecturer in computer methods in civil engineering, he had to go through BIM and now he's torturing his students with it. But learning a lot of new stuff as it goes, and I love to learn from Rino about his experiences with BIM and he's very well known for applying it in serious games like reality simulations they put people through and that's a really interesting use of building information modeling and actually potential way how this can be very beneficial for buildings in the future. So if you would like to hear what is the definition of BIM or what BIM is, if you have not faced it yet, I guess we gave a definition at the very, very end of the episode. But let me just try and briefly introduce you to the concept. BIM is a way that you store information along your drawings in a computer model so when you draw a wall it's not just you have drawn two lines that represent a wall you have drawn a wall if you click on it it knows it's a wall it knows what layers it has it knows what properties it has it knows its materials you can change this you can explore. Other software can access it. And the best thing, your colleague who's drawing the duct, they know that the wall was drawn and they see it in their model because it's all synchronized in the cloud. And that makes this a very powerful collaborative tool with a huge potential for use outside of just drawing buildings. It has so many uses. On paper, it's beautiful, but the reality is a little tougher. And we're very open to talk about that aspect of BIM. So I guess if you have not switched the episode, good, you're going to enjoy it. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Hello everybody. Welcome to Firesize Show. I have today two guests who are very willing to talk about the BIM, the next big thing in digital construction, maybe, I don't know. First, Pete Thompson from GHD, who recently transferred there from Autodesk, where he was building Revit, the number one tool in BIM. Hi, Pete. Great to have you here. Nice to meet you, Wojciech. Very happy to have you. My second guest, His Majesty, Reno Rolf Reglio of Massey University. Hey, Reno. Great to have you back in the show. Thank you for having me back, Wojciech. Yeah, fantastic. And you're making a lot of noise in the digital construction space. So I thought it would be great to have user opinion on BAM. So let's talk BIM. It's an interesting subject. Everyone talks about BIM. I don't know how it was for you. Obviously, it was the main thing. But maybe, Rino, for you, how did you end up in BIM? In here, everyone talks about BIM. We need to use BIM in the project. We need to move into digital twinning of buildings. We need to have this level, this level of BIM in this project. And I really fail to understand if people really get what they are asking for. And I also find transitioning into these advanced ways of modeling buildings in computers, including information layer, rather difficult for myself and my team. So how did you start up with your BIM journey and where did it bring you? So in my case, I bumped into BIM by accident and it was during my postdoc because we were back then developing a virtual reality training tool for earthquakes. And one of the technologies that was promised to be addressed in this project was the use of BIM. So, building information modeling is not just a 3D model. It's much more than a 3D model. It's a 3D model that has many other layers of information. So it's basically a database. And what we did back then is, unfortunately, to use only the 3D modeling part of BIM to develop the virtual reality scene. And somehow you can see that there are some advantages to use that path, but we explain why it's not an advantage as well to use it for virtual reality application. Because most of the time you don't really care about what is inside a wall in an evacuation experiment. And those information eventually get imported in the software that you use. For instance, you need to develop your virtual reality scenes, and then you need to spend time to delete all this stuff. On the other hand, it could be good if the BIM is already being developed by someone else, and then basically what you can do to develop a virtual reality application is doing a bit of cleaning up. But if you start from scratch to develop a real BIM and then try to put in VR, then you will realize soon that you put too much information that you don't really need it. And that was the first encounter. And then it became my job here at Mass University because, as I say every time, it's the technology that pays for my bills because it's the things that I always teach here at Mass University, together with many other digital technology in our undergrad and master program. And Pete, how did you get into the world of BIM? Probably, maybe 20 years ago, when I was building a simulation modeling company before Autodesk at IES in Glasgow. And we were developing lots of analysis tools for green building design for energy performance. And a lot of the models were starting to come in from Revit and other BIM packages. And we had a project there to basically make the import of those models as smooth as possible through either GBXML or IFC files. IFC files are the standard kind of open bim format but gbxml is kind of like the equivalent for green building design so generally in revit you can export your bim modelers gbxml or ifc we were seeing both coming through and year on year it was becoming more important you could see the adoption in the the industry was kind of driving that as well. So, yeah, a long time ago. A long time ago and 20 years ago, you were talking about importing data and if I were to list interesting topics, importing data from BIM into other applications would be still my number one concern. I have a joke for Pete. be still my number one concern. I have a joke for Pete. Are you capable to see the BIM without IFC readers, like in the Matrix, that you get used to read the code and then you see the building without having any? Are you able to see the three-dimensional building but just looking at the code, like in Matrix movie? Oh, the Matrix? No, I haven't quite achieved that level yet, no. But I'm pretty sure the letters in the BAM code do not align into shapes of buildings, you know, like in the Matrix movie. What I say to my students, if you start having this kind of vision, that means that you need to see a good doctor. That means they've been working too much. That's true. However, I know some people who do that looking at FDS codes, so it's achievable. For me, the information part in the BIM is the most interesting one. And I think many of us were doing BIM or information modeling way before touching Revit. I mean, if you have your AutoCAD model of your building and you name the layers by what they are, you've already did some information in there. And the information is growing the more advanced you go there. Yeah, you're giving us like what used to be the hybrid solution. The big difference, for instance, and it's one of the cases that I show always my students, if you draw a box in Autodesk, unless you write the information, you are a window. The object doesn't know that it's a window. When you start using BIM, you have a set of objects that you use in your project that you don't need to put the information. Look, you're a window with these parameters. So you start using objects that they know what they are. They have already some self-defined parameters that you need just to change the parameters. And this makes life much easier later on if you want to automate the process of analyzing the drawing, because you don't need a human that goes there and starts reading, ah, this is a door. This looks like a door. This looks like a door. So we have three doors. You can just have a line of code and tell the software in BIM, find all the instances that are defined as a door. I don basic polygons and triangles. It's a nice, smooth package to use, but it is nowhere near as information rich as the BIM model. In BIM, the big difference for me is when you, for example, if you just draw a wall, as soon as you draw that wall, when you draw the wall on the screen, inside the package, it knows that that wall is a brick wall. It's got a cavity. It's got insulation on the back because you've chosen to start with a standard wall type. And as soon as you start drawing, it knows all of that information. You can change it because you can change the type of wall after the fact. But it's right from the get-go, everything comes with information supplied. And that's the big difference. And that's why it's been making so many inroads over the last 20 years into industry, because potentially it should make your life a lot easier when you start to connect that to other analysis packages. Because in theory, when you go to another modeling package like fds if fds had a perfect ifc file importer you wouldn't have to draw a new model again in fds you could just do your fire modeling because all the information or nearly all the information would have been brought in it's just that that's been a slow process to come on board and you're talking not about just transferring the three-dimensional geometry of my building, you're talking about the thermal properties of my walls, the distribution of my fuel inside the model. Exactly. And we are talking now about the kind of warmth of BIM, interoperability. Yeah, it's a dream. It's a beautiful dream, but still a dream in a way. Well, eventually the world is moving in that direction. It's inevitable it will happen. It's just how soon and how widespread will it be? I think for Autodesk, at some point you guys started developing own CFD code and own tools for modeling. So what was this in a way connected with this Beam revolution? The CFD team at Autodesk aren't part of the Revit team, but I mean obviously they test out the connection. But the whole ethos moment in Revit is that every function which is written in the software generally is also made available in the API. So if anybody wants to come along and write their own little custom add-in, they can start to extract that information as well um everything is quite a good policy that all of that functionality is open obviously you need some coding expertise to get into it but it is possible and i've seen a lot more students recently start to do that kind of thing and in terms of interoperability i've been helping coordinate working groups on enhancing the IFC standards for occupant movement modeling. Asim Siddiqui and Peter Lawrence at Greenwich University are halfway through upgrading the IFC standards for occupant movement modeling. And it's in the process. Rino, you wanted to add something? I want to say that a key player has been what is the role of governments in different countries. Because in the UK, I can say that in the US, there has been a lot more going on because there was a mandate in the use of BIM for many projects. There are other countries that are a bit slow, like unfortunately New Zealand, because we decided to use the policy, let's be kind and wait that the industry will adjust and start using this technology if it's really worth using it. And so this is creating for us a lot of delay in the implementation and in development of these tools. But I can tell you that there is a lot of startups and a lot of, it's not just a matter of a big company doing their efforts. There are a lot of small companies and small groups that are making these big efforts to make BIM interoperability more and more effective. So the governments are pushing for BIM and many projects get specified BIM. But I really wondered at what extent the benefits of BIM really go into a construction project. I mean, outside of having this nice three-dimensional drawing and get collision check is one important thing that really can save your life sometimes. And I've seen that happen already. So where else the benefits for the construction industry lie in putting all this additional information in the model? Or just model creation is easier? Maybe that's also a thing. I'm not sure because I'm not building my BIM models like real models yet. Yeah, sure. In most of the commercial design areas and medium to large scale projects, In most of the commercial design areas in medium to large scale projects, the BIM models now kind of hosted on cloud. And that centralized managed cloud service where the design team connect and draw the BIM data down is controlled. And you can always rewind for a history of updates, et cetera, et cetera. But particularly, everybody gets up to the minute access to the latest design. regularly everybody gets up-to-the-minute access to the latest design. And you'll see more and more now in some more of the advanced construction sites around the world, people with rugged tablets, iPads, et cetera, and it's starting to replace paper. So they're getting the latest drawings and the latest information updated time and time again. And that's the big change, I'd say, because it was always the case. I was a construction engineer many years ago, and you'd end up with this kind of concrete-covered drawing. You'd be dusting off on site, which was probably three months out of date. Now it's possible to have that up to the minute, synchronized, controlled, and they'll make changes rapidly, and they can implement those on site pretty quickly. So it should get over some of those losses that come from having out-of-date things and also the gains that come from being able to update things straight away. Have you ever seen a revision cloud cut in concrete? Because I did. You know, like the revision cloud you put in AutoCAD to highlight detail or something. I've seen that literally cut in a slab. So sometimes too much information is too much information. But I guess in BIM, when you're in a 3D mode, it's pretty obvious it's a revision cloud, not an outline of all in the slab. And Rino, how do you see benefits? How do you sell BIM to your students? Why do you tell them it's important outside of you being able to finance your bills? But also if you want to see from a drawing point of view, there are also some nice video that you can find on YouTube in which there is the construction process. It can give a fundamental contribution in cost estimation, project management, avoiding clash and stuff like that. But the fact that you have a BIM information, that means that you have an instruction manual for the building. So it's like the building is done. Now you can give this instruction manual to the owner of the building and facility management. And that's what we are trying to push here in our program also to educate facility management on the use of BIM. Because if you see the real cost of a building, it's not the construction cost, it's the operation cost of the time life of the building. And if you start using BIM tool to make assessment and use it as an information tool to keep up all the assets that you have in place, it can become a really powerful tool. Do we do it in real life? E is the answer. Probably not much. And I can tell you that there is a lot of education that we need to do because we have been focusing quite a lot at this stage on the construction sector to educate people on the use of BIM. And I think we need to put now a lot more emphasis and education on the facility management side. So it's literally here is the keys to your new building and here is the digital twin, which you can play a bit with. Exactly. And you need to know about your building inside, right? And you're basically telling us also what is the other advantage, because then you can also connect the information with sensor and have real-time information. And this can become a really big thing, even for safety, because if we have real-time data, and Pete was doing it with Daniel Nilsson project like that, using sensor to estimate, for instance, how many people you have in a building or in a specific room. All this information that can be really useful for facility management point of view can become really important also when you need to rescue someone. Absolutely. I wonder now how FHIR comes into play with BAM. What would be the benefit for fire engineer? And let's put modeling aside, like let's put FDS and evacuation modeling aside for a second, because here would be some obvious benefits to collaborate on BAM models. But outside of that, if you're just preparing a fire safety strategy for your building, if you are just responsible for determining the basic safety functions of your building, maybe you are just interested if your building is compliant with the building code. To what extent BIM comes into play there? It's a good point, Wojciech, because when we were looking at implementing evacuation modeling, advanced simulation in Revit and testing the different things out at certain times. We were chatting to customers and asked what they wanted. First thing they said was travel distance calculations. Of course, the fancy 3D modeler in me, I go, oh, really? But actually, what pays the bills? And it's the prescriptive regulations on, what, 90 plus percent of buildings. So it's easy to get carried away with the advanced 3D modeling sometimes and forget what pays the bread and butter bills on many consultants' doorsteps. So the first thing that we did was implement half the travel distance calculator in Revit. And then we built on that for when the pandemic hit to do social distance tools as well. when the pandemic hit to do social distance tools as well. So you could lay out your seating positions and corridors with one-way traffic streams and start to plan out those things. So we did that pretty quickly in response to, again, customers' needs. So the geometry is there to do your distance calculations. You can now plot A to B and calculate the travel distances for your prescriptive regulations. But also, there are automated code compliance checkers becoming available. I think Briab have one in Scandinavia. There's a company in... We have one in New Zealand as well. Yep. There's also energy code compliance ones. Energy modeling is the other hat that I've had for the last 20 years in terms of green building design. So there's enough information there to fulfill many of the criteria for prescriptive regulations checks. Now, often each prescriptive regulation is going to require very particular information for the local country rules, but at least you're starting from an information-rich point, and it should reduce the heavyweight amount of data you have to put in to your prescriptive regulations checks hopefully there's enough information there to give you a good start that it's not quite as painful going through all that process of checking all the prescriptive regulation checks you know from my personal experience we've participated in some really large projects and at some point, we felt like we are the source of information. Like if electrician guys changed some things, the firemen knew about it because they had to go to him. So if, let's say, the lighting people or ventilation people wanted to know what the electricians changed, they didn't go to electricians, they came to us. Or when the ventilation people changed something in terms of ducting and so on, we were responsible to transfer that knowledge to the architectural team. Say, okay, you know, here you have to move something because now you will be out of distance, out of space. You're like, you know, there are these levels of areas of the building that you are allowed to build in as a single fire compartment and so on and so on. So we were monitoring this compliance. And I guess once you have this automated compliance checkers, the distance checkers, whatever inside your model working, automated, whatever decision you take, wherever in the building, you're capable of almost automatically checking the consequences of that decision. you're capable of almost automatically checking the consequences of that decision. Absolutely. And that does not sound very sexy until you try to commission a building and suddenly your path of distance is one centimeter longer than the load by load. I don't know what you have to do. You wait for winter so everything shrinks a little bit. But these things happen in real life, especially in terms of building distances, separation distances, and stuff like that. So these automated checkers can be like superb tools. Rino, I saw on LinkedIn some videos you were playing with automated layout generators and stuff like that. And immediately when I saw that, into my mind came the episode with Benjamin Ralf. He's now at Foster's. And he said that the world of architecture is a world of rapid prototyping. Like, give me 10 layouts. Okay, I like layout one, two, and three. Give me 10 of each more. Again, and again, and again. And there's no place for performance-based fire engineering when you have to go to 100 iterations of your layout within one day. you have to go through a hundred iterations of your layout within one day. So I guess suddenly the fact you're automated with everything means this rapid prototyping is possible. Yeah, that's another big advantage of what is going to be probably the future of designing. It is called generative design. And we actually played last year a bit, me, Pete, and my colleagues, and I'm thinking about the possibility to use this paradigm if we want to apply it for fire safety. What will be the steps required if you want to apply generative design specifically for fire purpose? If you download now one of the latest version of Revit, you have generative design tools that they show you some case study about, or you can have a different layout of desk or different layout depending on the objective that you have. For instance, the decks can be placed and programmed in a way that you optimize the view from all the windows you have around, or you can have a COVID guidelines that tells you that the distance and then the software is capable to create a different iteration and show you what will be the location in different design solution. But in our case, we start thinking, what if the goal is far safety? What are the steps that we need to do? What we need to do to connect the BIM information with the existing software and try to create multiple iterations. And from an evacuation point of view, you can think like it's easy to do 100,000 iterations of an evacuation simulation. If you have a really advanced CFD model, that's not easy any longer. So that's the things we discussed in a letter to the editor that we sent last year to Fire Technology. All the challenge that we need to face in the future and what will be possible, putting it in a joke to get rid of Fire Engineer. Like let the computer become the Fire Engineer of the future. But of course, there will be always a Fire Engineer because you need to set up boundaries and optimal solution and verify that eventually the solution does make sense because a computer is not capable to understand eventually if something is really good or completely dumb. Yeah, we've had the situation where sometimes you engage with engineers and you start to describe about how you're automating some of these processes and some of the initial reactions is a little scared because obviously if they spend currently a week you know doing consultancy on a particular size of design and you say can you you can automate it and get it done in two days then there's a little bit of fear that they're going to be able to build this but actually what happens is it means that they can try out a much richer set of options for the client. So that's a big message, that because the holy grail of this process is that all your information is in the BIM model, and you have a rapid and solid connection to your analysis packages, and you've got the round trip. With that round trip of data, you don't have to keep remodel building every time. You can run many different options and simulations and try and try again. It means that all of a sudden, whereby you would just test out one single design, you can test out 5, 10, 15 potentially if that connection is solid. And that's where one of the big gains is that all of a sudden, as a fire engineer, your life should become a bit more interesting in terms of some of those projects, not always the most interesting. The mundane tasks, which can be automated, could be automated, and then you can do more of the interesting stuff and hopefully come up with a safer design as well. I think we're never in a point where a market for fire safety engineers is fully saturated. The amount of new projects being opened every week, even if I look at the skyline of Warsaw, the amount of new projects popping every now and then due to the demands of the market, even in the post-COVID times, it's insane. And we are never nowhere close to producing the fire safety engineers, the capable and smart and well-trained fire safety engineers who understand fire safety engineering to the level of the demands of the building industry. Especially that we seem to be generating the problems quicker than we generate solutions. So I don't think we're running out of problems anywhere soon. And this being episode 60-something-ish of my podcast is a statement to that. I'm nowhere close to running of interesting topics to talk in here because we are just very, very good at generating them. You've mentioned that the Holy Grail will be having all the information in BIM model and then seamless integration with everything else around it. So yeah, let's open this kind of forms and let's go into this seamless integration. And for me, as someone who's building CFD models, this is the painful part. It's not easy. And I guess we can talk a lot of time on why it's not easy, but I think the best way to summarize that is that building your numerical model, your model as an engineer, it's a process which has a purpose. I'm building a model of my building for a certain purpose. And I understand that purpose. I know that if I mistake some dimension by one centimeter and I'm modeling a hundred meter long wall, I know it is irrelevant to my model. I know that if my doorknob has extremely fancy shape, I understand it has zero impact on my flow field around the door. And this is what I mean about, you know, purposeful modeling. I understand the purpose. So I understand the level of generalization I can put in my model and still receive the full information out of it. model and still receive the full information out of it. However, when you transport information from BIM, there is no, at least at my understanding, there is no easy way to tell me, okay, import me everything. But when you're importing doors, you know, leave the doorknobs alone. I don't want them. And this suddenly the problem is not building my model, it's reducing the information to the smallest amount that forms the model. And I found this really, really tough. Am I alone in this or this is the world we live in? No, no, it's a known issue. Because at the moment when you export your IFC file from a BIM package, it in general includes all the detail. IFC file from a BIM package, it in general includes all the detail. And then the receiving package has to spend time filtering out the information it doesn't want. And that slows down the whole process. I think if we look potentially at kind of customized IFC exporters, which I think is probably the way forward, then, for example, when we're exporting things for analytical modeling, like fire safety or energy modeling, CFD, that kind of thing, what needs to happen is there needs to be a level of detail switch somewhere in the system to turn off some of the detailed ironmongery, the detailed ball frames on the windows, etc., etc., etc. And now the IFC exporter for Revit is open source and can be accessed and customized. Master's student, supervised at Lund University Nazim, he wrote a customized add-in which exported the model data and added some information, sent it into Pathfinder with some good success because we work with Pathfinder at the same time and they enhance some of the import and that was a great prototype of showing what's possible and we're hoping to build on that in the future as a principle I would say I think that's probably one of the important things to tackle as one of the next steps is to have a level of detailed or a customized IFC exporter which strips out the unnecessary information before you send it to disk. Because for those big, big projects, it can take quite a long time to import those IFC models. Unnecessary is one word, but a CFD model can work with unnecessary data. It's just how much more you spend to solve for that. I think the most interesting way would be to import BIM into something like a ZOM model, like a B-Risk or CFS, you know, because there is no irrelevant data there. Your compartment is your compartment. That's the minimum amount of data. It's just the dimension and materials on the walls. That's the smallest package you transport. And essentially, when you're building your CFD model, it would be closer to the CFAS model than closer to the BIM model, you know, because it is just a slightly enhanced geometry, but not really that much enhanced. You don't want it to be that much enhanced geometry. Reno, you've mentioned in the beginning of the talk that while building model, you take your doors, put it in your model, and the model knows it's a door. You put a window in, it knows it's a window. Maybe what we need is a multiverse of doors. You place one door, and the model knows that for this level of detail, the door is like this. But if I trigger the switch here, the door is like just a rectangle with a named door on it, and it's the same door at the same location, and then this layer could be exported. And it's something that has been already defined, as Pete was saying. We have already definition level of details in the BAM. It's just that probably we didn't spend enough time to implement the possibility to extract up to a certain level of information. And I understand your discussion on fire. I think instead it will be really interesting and probably revolutionary, the possibility to have so much three-dimensional information for evacuation point of view instead, because humans don't behave like smoke or fire. And if you think back in the day, we have been always oversimplified that a building is like a layer, and all the information of the geometry is just on a layer. And the information is always the interaction of the agents with the building is always conceived in a flat surface. And now we have the possibility to have agents that are capable to view in a 3D model and start having 3D information. And this is part, for instance, once again, of the job that Pete, for instance, is doing with many other universities, Lund University, University of Canterbury, on the possibility to develop 3D models that start getting rid of this flat idea, even in terms of fundamental diagrams and the concept of density that used to be really good 20, 30 years ago, But now we need to start seeing what's the real deal, what is the real reason moving people in a certain way and driving their interaction with each other. And back in the day, it was like Simulex is developed by Pete. It was a good attempt with what was the technology when he was young, probably 20 kilos ago. I'm kidding. In which he was developing something on what was available back then, a flat surface in which you were supposed to put agents. Now we can actually start moving in a three-dimensional evacuation model. And BIM will give us for free all this kind of information that we might need. I say we might need because we don't know much of the information we actually process in our brain when we move in a crowd. Probably we also in that case oversimplify the information that we need in a model because probably humans, they don't start seeing too much details. They don't even care in their movement about the details. Probably we simplify in our brain when we move the perception of the building. But that perception, that decision-making process, that would be the role of the evacuation model software. Now, the role of BIM would be to support it with very detailed information about the building, maybe even the occupants in the building, layers of obstacles. Just to give you a simple idea, let's assume to have an agent that needs to navigate in a space. And back in the day, if you want to set up the possibility of an agent to check what exits are visible, if you're doing it in a flat surface, it's going to be really challenging to represent three-dimensional space on a flat surface. Instead, if you have already a 3D model and you set the height of an agent, you know already if it's going to be capable to see an evacuation sign, an exit. And this is just from a simple perspective point of view. But back in the day, if we were oversimplifying, that was the problem, that we couldn't push too much. And even investigators bother to investigate what's the human perception in three-dimensional space. And all this can be computed in a more realistic evacuation model. And I guess this is the step forward that Peter probably wants to do compared with this PhD work, probably wants to do compared with this PhD work is to get rid of the two-dimensional space and start considering the actual deal of evacuation. Yeah, Pete, moving into GGD movement strategies, sounds like you're moving into the direction Reno said, so maybe share us a bit about your future and your plans, because I have a feeling they very well connect to what has just been discussed. Yeah, I mean, actually the current project I'm working on is called Woonity, which is the wildfire urban interface evacuation modeling. So in connection with Jonathan Volkwist's work at Lund. So creating an interface to drive that. It's not related to BIM, but it is drawing in multiple sources of information to do advanced modeling of fire and evacuation just on a wider scale. In terms of where I think ultimately things want to be heading, as Rina said, traditional evacuation modeling has been on two dimensions. Obviously, the BIM model has three-dimensional rich information. on two dimensions. Obviously, the BIM model has three-dimensional rich information. The possibility is to automate the geometry and additional properties like signage, etc., coming into the evacuation models. And then further than that, you know, further downstream, it should be possible to look at line of sight from where a person is standing in the room to which signs they can see and that's more of a three-dimensional problem because it could be in relation to any partitions that are in your way doors walls in different positions whereas you know in two dimensions it might look fine you can now start to get to the point whereby if that connection is good, you've got the information about the signs and different stimuli, that you can start to work out the motivations of people and actually start to use another step again above the basic geometry. Now, the cool things that I've been always thinking about is that we can recycle a lot of AI algorithms that were developed for games because a lot of visualization and perception were already developed for games, to develop AI, for instance, of shooters that need to shoot the player. So they kind of have this possibility to perceive space. And of course, they weren't based on real data. But now we have the possibility to recycle some old algorithms, implement some data, and data is the other kind of worm in my field. Generate new data and generate new data to develop models that represent the actual reality of evacuee. One thing from my own space, because I'm currently doing a grant with the University of Ubertal, Professor Lucas Arnold on the visibility of evacuation signs. And we are very interested in lighting conditions, because that's critical to the perception of the sign. For example, the traditional model of JIN, if I'm not wrong, it is estimated that 80 looks lighting in your building. No one takes that into account. In different lighting conditions, you will have different outcomes and different perception of the reality, even without smoke. And when smoke comes into question, the complexity is at the ridiculous level. So it's very interesting if now in BIM, you could not only just transfer from one layer to another layer, but add multiple layers at the same time. You know, imagine if I had a maestro calculation combined with a lightning simulation of my room. So I understand what are the lightning conditions now, what will be the lightning conditions when I cut the power to my building. How will that change the perception of the signs? And these two sources of information go into evacuation model, where the occupants, as you said, would be able to determine the path of view and understand if they can see the sign or not. And another thing that we haven't discussed yet is the possibility to develop a training solution for buildings. Okay, yeah. Because if you have this information, we can actually potentially have the possibility to change the behavior of future evacuation because now we can start developing BIM-based training tools in which you don't need to actually run a drill. You need just to have a BIM model implemented on the cloud and say, okay, this is your office. Those are the instructions that you need to follow. You can have a gamer that actually tells you, walking in the digital building, what's the closest exit? And in case there is a fire or a hazard close to the closest exit, what are the other options? And it's a lot that can be done for simulating, but also to educate people on fire safety and show them what are the consequences of good choice or bad choice, not just in terms of evacuation, but even firefighting. Because we have been developing a lot of prototyping here, even to show them the consequences of using the wrong fire extinguisher in a building. consequences of using the wrong fire extinguisher in fire in a building. And this can become really customized because if you develop the BIM for constructing the building, why not recycle this information and develop something that can be used? And to be honest, it doesn't take that much time today to get the BIM and convert it into fire safety evacuation drills. It used to be a nightmare six years ago. Now we have all the tools to do it in a couple of days. In a virtual reality setting, right? It can be virtual reality in terms of immersive virtual reality. So you put a headset, but it can even be on a desktop. Like a shooter game. And from a safety point of view, we are trying to identify if it's really worth to put people in a virtual reality headset or it's enough to do a training, to have a training in a three-dimensional space, just using a desktop that is more affordable and accessible to everyone. Even better if this application is on the web. And that's the things that we are trying to do. So you don't need even to install the software. You just browser to a specific software. And there is a lot of challenge to put it on our servers. I've been doing something like that, crash every two days. So there are a lot of challenges that needs to be done from a technology point of view, but I think we are getting there. But for that, there will be also a technical limitation that the building changes. So the BAM model would have to be up to date. It's going to be perfectly up to date until the last day of construction when someone is being paid to do that and then check of what's being delivered. But once the BIM model is passed to the administrator of the building, the administrator must be conscious. And I can tell you that for big infrastructure airports, remember it was one of the major airports, there is a team that is always there updating the BIM information. If you care about the information, you need to have a team that is looking after it. And that's a role that should be in the future in big building, a BIM manager taking account of all the possible change if we see the value in having this updated information. I think airport would be an easy thing to manage. I think a sports arena would be a very easy thing to manage. I think a large office building would be a mess because many owners of the flats would have quite big autonomy in managing their own spaces. In Poland, from the fire safety perspective, we would often deliver the building in shell and core with just open plan offices and whatever you do at the office. I mean, you have your own fire expert. You have your own responsibilities. It's not that you're allowed to store crude oil in your flat, but still there's a level of autonomy. You have to arrange your own space. And this transfer between the lease company and the owner of the whole building, responsible for the global safety, that's a difficult interface. No, definitely. I was saying that one of the reasons to incentivize the upgrade of information is insurance. Because if we can think about the future, if you have an upgraded information, that means that you have more understanding of what's happening in that building. And if there are people that go and cut and make holes in fire cells, you know that they are there. And this can have a lot of implication in when you need to insure and make an insurance on assets. We can think that in the future, if we have upgraded information and you keep this, you might get some discount in that. I'm just speculating. You're right, Reno. I mean, I said the Holy Grail was to get all the rich data from your BIM model into the design packages. But actually, the additional side of that is also that the model grows and lives with the building. So, you know, it starts off in an early architectural stage that it develops as the level of detail of modeling progresses through design stages. You go to your planning control, you get permission to build, and then the construction process starts. And in theory, every single step of the way, as changes are made, even after the design has been given the go-ahead, then further change is going to get made during the construction process, inevitably, as somebody works out that something doesn't work and something else doesn't work and then it gets to commissioning stage and then the commissioning happens and ideally all every single single step of the way there should be a living model of the building updated you know as permits come on track people go in maybe three years later they go ahead and add new openings between floors in buildings to get new central heating systems in or whatever or sprinklers ideally that would all be stored in one central model and and that was one of the things highlighted in the grenfell report when they looked at what went wrong that exactly that you know what was happening was apart from the original design other stuff happened since the conception of the design, retrofit, changes, etc., etc. So one very single thing which caused the loss of life, it's a combination of factors. The cladding was a problem, for sure, but other things happened along the way. People got in, you know, it's a traditional construction process where somebody goes in, get a permit to do something they make the work they do the changes but it's not coordinated and logged and the trouble is in the world of fire safety engineering and physical modeling you change one thing you change something else and it has an impact somewhere else unless it's all coordinated stuff gets missed if you want to really don't have nightmare tonight think that we are applying the same technology also on city level. But we talk also about city information model. And the challenge is also there to digitalize what wasn't digital in the past and to keep this information updated. And in a big version of a digital twin of a city. big version of a digital twin of a city. I know that there are a million pounds that were lately invested in a research project looking after the roads at the University of Cambridge, if I'm not wrong, just focusing on the digitalization of the road infrastructure in the UK. So it's a really big deal. It's a big challenge, but it's the things that keep us alive, I guess, as a researcher, try to tackle this really challenge. When we talk about this maintaining the BIM, I have one last thing to ask, and that's accessibility. If I run an architectural company or even I specialize in safety engineering, and this is the tool that pays my bills, I would probably pay for it and buy it. And let's face it, it's not a super cheap solution. It's a specialized piece of software. But if I'm an owner of a medium-sized building, I'm not sure if I wanted to purchase licensing and everything to manage my thing. And also, if I'm not in a rich country, I'm somewhere else, and yet I would love to benefit from this technology. To what extent the open access or the freeware side of this world is growing? Is there even such a thing, or is it fully around large companies like Autodesk? Before we go, it was really interesting to find out that you can actually buy tokens and it costs you like three euros per day to use Revit. So maybe that's a solution in a way. But I don't think that solves this wide accessibility idea. You know, I come from Poland. We have a way to solve that. It's called piracy. It's not being used that much in here anymore. Is there an open access scene on the BIM industry? I mean, IFC is something very universal, right? Yeah, I mean, there are some free BIM packages, which are open source. I mean, obviously, I was invested in Revit, so I don't know that much about them. But I do know they exist. There's certainly a lot of free BIM viewers. So if someone's produced a BIM model, then you can get it. But there are BIM, free BIM authoring tools around. Some, I mean, SketchUp, for example, I don't think it's free in certain situations. It's not really what I would call a regular BIM tool. It's got a limited amount of information, but it is referred to as a BIM tool sometimes. You can get some information from it, but there are other free BIM tools. Generally, BIM is free to most universities and academic institutions, at least to train and test on. But the thing is, if the long-term future here is to have your building model stored centrally and hosted, someone's got to pay for the bills. Because ultimately, even if it's just the hosting and the administration costs for centralizing and storing the making sure it's secure etc etc someone's got to pay for it but i think probably the secret in pushing that forward is as has been in the past the government implementing bim mandates i mean at the moment many countries around the world, the US was the first, UK, several, you know, various European countries, it's happening in other countries around the world, is that all government projects have to be designed with BIM packages. What probably needs to happen next for proper digital twin modeling to occur is that governments start to need to mandate that not only is a BIM model required for the design but it's also required for the monitoring as well and and I mean there's an additional cost but then it depends what value you put on the losses that you can get by not doing that and then this specification is used usually in terms of the BIM level or some specific IFC requirements, not saying you have to use Revit or something. So that's good. That allows everyone to participate in the revolution. And I guess the more people participate, the cheaper the cost of technology is, the more widespread it is, the more possibilities you will have to also cater for the needs of those who may have difficulties accessing. Mostly cost-related, because let's face it, I mean, you also need not your usual laptop computer to open a 5GB Revit model. It's not going to really work well. It takes a while. Yeah? Rino, you have a good computer? Yeah, it's my excuse to ask my boss for a good computer. And then you mine F-Room. I know that for sure. Okay. In the good old times, yes. Okay, guys, that was interesting to talk about BIM a bit. One thing we didn't do is to define BIM. I'll try to do that in the introduction. It's going to end up horribly and you're going to spam me with emails that you're disgusted by my attempt on that. Maybe you want to define at the end, after all of this, BIM, try to define BIM. So, I mean, essentially, BIM is not just drawing. It is right at the start. When you start to create your design, you do it in three dimensions from the get-go, and inherently everything has physical properties. So you're not just drawing lines in a model. You're actually creating three-dimensional physical objects as you draw right from the start, as soon as the first wall goes down. And from that point on, the model, as you build it up, has all of that information in it and potentially available to be used for other packages. It's a multi-parameter 3D space rather than just a series of dimensional polygons, which is your traditional view of AutoCAD. Yeah. Fair summary, Rino? Yeah, no, I can pretend to be smart and read the definition. Don't. I'll cut this out. No. No. If I should do a definition of BAM, what is in my mind as a BAM, as a clear definition, like one shot, is a smart database. mind as a BIM, as a clear definition, like one shot is a smart database. It's a smart database with three-dimensional visualization. And there are a lot of keywords like 3D parametric model, it can be associated with it and process as well, because it helps in the process of construction. It's a lot of words. There are a lot of keywords that can be associated with BIM, but the things that deeply, I believe that is the key feature of BIM is the fact that it's a really comprehensive database or instruction manual of a building. It's like a smart database with a three-dimensional interface. It's a smart database that you can walk through. That's a nice feature we have. And if you want, it's like Lego manual. Lego manual. Lego manual. It tells you when in place and you have pretty much the information unless someone changed the blocks of what has been put there. If you want a really super easy interpretation of what is even a database. So you know how many pieces of red block you had or how many pieces of blue box you had. And they are not just blocks there that build a wall. They have information about what they are. That block can be a door, that block can be a window. So it's much easier to go back and say ah, let's see how many doors of this feature we had and what will be the cost and the tendering process for this specific door. Yeah, and a good demonstration of what you get from drawing in BIM or creating a building in BIM is, probably a good example is if you use something like Unity Reflect, which is a games engine viewer of your BIM model, and pretty much automatically you get something which looks really quite photorealistic out of the box. And all of a sudden, the kind of light bulb goes on and you realize all of that stuff was in the BIM model. You know, the color of the blocks, the surface roughness, all of that stuff was in the bin model you know the color of the blocks the the surface roughness all of that stuff was there it's just that because you're viewing it in sketch mode you're just not aware of it but it's it's all there don't do my mistakes because i tried it the 30 days trial and put my credit card detail and then i forgot the trial and then on my credit card there were unity fees of $1,600. I had to talk to my wife and my university if they could. So don't do that mistake because you might end up sleeping on the couch that night. Maybe just play the video on YouTube first. It's a lot cheaper. Yeah. It's a lot cheaper. Okay. Everyone should try it and play because that's the future. And if you don't want to be excluded from the future, you'll have to learn some of this. Either you like it or not eventually, so why not starting now? Guys, thank you very much for this super interesting discussion on BIM and FireSafe and just as a tool in the construction process. It was a huge pleasure to have you in the fire science show and looking forward to the future of BIM and the future of you in fire safety. Because both things looks exciting. Thanks guys. Thank you. Thanks. Good talking to you, Wojciech. And that's it. You know, sometimes when I recall the episode and I have a discussion, I know it's going to be a good one. I know it's going to be a popular one. And I have such a feeling about this BIM episode because I really enjoyed it. I mean, I don't necessarily enjoy transferring data from BIM to my CFD models, which is a hell of a pain. But I certainly enjoy talking about the future of civil engineering and fire safety and all the exciting things that can happen if we can make this work. Really, this is a beautiful technology. On paper, it's amazing. It's improving. Every day, it's better. And as you heard, Pete, in his days in Autodesk, when they received a request, they were implementing it. There are people working on exporters, on other add-ins that will help us achieve what we want from this software without the pain that we may have today. So it's developing, it's there, it's growing. If you want it to be better, maybe just talk with these guys, tell them what we need. And I have a feeling it's going to be great. I mean, already we, in my office for the last two years, we have been switching more and more into Revit and BIM importing and working with architects like they like it. And it's good for our business. It's good for the discussions that we have. I certainly appreciate the fact that the model is up to date and I don't have to send an email every time I start working with my model. This is the newest version. So, yeah, I guess there's more advantages than disadvantages. And annoying features, they're being improved, they're being worked on. Eventually, they'll be removed. I'm really looking forward to this level of detail switch in Revit. If they can make it work, it will be brilliant, and it will solve so many of the issues we have with this technology today. So absolutely looking forward to the future, and I'm very, very happy to have had this conversation with Pete and Reno. And, guys, thank you so much. It was really nice to learn BIM from you. So that's it for today, guys. I hope you've enjoyed this as much as I did. I mean, if you're still listening, I guess that is the case. As usual, I'm looking forward to meet you here next Wednesday. Cheers. This was the fire science show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
