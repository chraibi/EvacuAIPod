 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today I'm taking you to a trip to Brussels. Well, technically it's a trip to Istra in Northern Italy, but the stuff we're going to talk is very Brussels-ish, if I may. I have connected with an amazing person, Dr. Ademantia Athanasopoulou from Joint Research Center of European Commission, who has recently led a task, they've published a massive, massive report on state of performance-based fire safety engineering in Europe. And that was my initial trigger to talk with Adam Antje. But as you will see in this discussion, it's not covering that report only because we went way, way more into how fire safety regulations can be issued in Europe, the story of Eurocodes, and how it is an example of good development in communication between engineers, how European Commission uses research to guide its developments, and what can they do with the knowledge that Avantia found with her group on the state of performance-based research? I'm going to link the report in the show notes. It's very useful to take a look into it. I think for the first time, I really saw a really pan-European overview of where we are with fire safety engineering in it. And I really admire the amount of work done there by the group of Valamentia and by her group of angel experts who are supporting European Commission in performing this research. So, yeah, a lot to unwrap in here, much more than just the contents of the report. Let's have a peek inside how European Commission and fire safety regulations work in here. Let's speed the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Thank you.

I'm here today with Dr. Adamantia Athanasopoulou from Joint Research Center of the European Commission. Hey, Adamantia, great to have you in the podcast. Great to be here. Hello, Vojta. Hello to everybody. We've connected through LinkedIn, and it was quite brilliant because I've discovered a report that JRC has published on the state of fire safety engineering in Europe. And absolutely, we're going to talk about the Reaper a lot. But we've also briefly met and I am fascinated by you, your role and the interests of the European Commission. So before we jump into the contents of the magnificent Reaper, please tell me how did you end up working on the state of fire safety engineering on behalf of the European Commission? Okay, so I have to share a detail, an important one, before starting. I'm a civil engineer, a structural engineer. I'm not a fire safety engineer. And perhaps, I don't know, am I the first one in this show to not be fire safety? We need to define what a fire safety engineer is first, and that's not a trivial task either. See, good point, very good point. So how we ended up, why I'm speaking about fire safety engineering in the first place. So I am a civil engineer, graduated from the University of Patras in Greece and then I wanted a big challenge in my life and crossed the ocean and found myself in the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, USA. I did my master's and PhD there, focusing on the seismic performance of concrete low-rise shear walls. These are the walls you would find in a typical park structure. And investigating how to use high-performance fiber-infused concrete there. Working in the laboratory, a great five years time there, missing Europe. And there comes an opportunity to work as a researcher for the European Commission. And I find myself in the JRC. This is the Joris Center of the European Commission. It is a science service of the European Commission. It has more than 2,000 scientists working on various, various fields in science and engineering, supporting the European Commission in the whole policy production and development cycle. So giving expert opinion, scientific opinion, scientific data recommendations to the European Commission. JRC is located in many countries around Europe. The largest site is found in Isfra, northern Italy, and this is where I am also today talking to you. So I went today, see, that was in 2009, to work as a research fellow in a project supporting implementation of policies and standards for the construction sector. Nothing yet on fire. Mostly structural design, because at the time, the Eurocodes were in development. What are the Eurocodes? These are the European standards for structural design. Common European standards. Common language. Bringing together design philosophies, design mentalities, design traditions in the world of structural engineering. Great work done at that time. Nothing yet on fire, but a lot of expertise and experience acquired on how to bring together engineers and have common standards to design a building, a bridge, a silo, a structure. In 2012, I moved back to my home country, back to university, teaching structural engineering. Nothing is fine yet. I'm still ignorant about this field, you know. No, seriously. I mean, I had traditional Greek civil engineering, earthquakes and concrete structures. This is the typical, you know, path. So I'm teaching structural mechanics, structural engineering, concrete. And in 2016, I'm called back to the JRC. Same location, Ispra, Italy. Same unit called Safety and Security of Buildings Unit. Called back to a similar project like the one I was working. This time, the Euroclos were fully implemented at the time in the EU member states. A success story. If you think about, we're talking about more than 1,000 experts working on standardization of structural design and with huge momentum in adoption internationally. So now the project is a bit extended, covering policies and standards for sustainable construction and also looking into new fields of application. And then starts the discussion about fire. Why we were discussing about fire design at that point, 2016. Seeing technological developments and the need for improved energy performing buildings, changing significantly the built environment, bringing new challenges for the European policymakers. Because at the JSC still we are supporting the European Commission, most importantly DGGROW, which is the partner DG. So there seems to be a need to look into fire safety design policies and standards. design policies and standards. An important point is that fire safety in the built environment is a national competence and regulated by the EU member states. So nothing can come out from the European Commission as a regulation of fire safety design. However, Commission can play and plays an important role with complementary activities, facilitating education and dissemination. So this is the, so it is in the radar, fire design is in the radar of the European Commission. Being in a unit with a lot of expertise in structural design, in experimental methods, in supporting sterilization, comes there. So we start thinking about what to do, how to support. And unfortunately, we are now in 2017, and there is a Grand Solid Power Fire in the UK. So this was actually having fire safety in the radar of the European Commission, but then having really a bell ringing above our heads that you guys, you need to look into this. We'll jump into the next things. So we're going to continue about the developments from 2017. What a story it is. And I love how you switched branches from earthquake engineering. I actually just had an episode with researcher Nagaralami Khorasny from University of Buffalo. She's implementing a lot of stuff from earthquake engineering into probabilistic fire engineering. So we are somewhat familiar. well, maybe not very, but somewhat familiar with the concepts of earthquake engineering and how they play. And it's fantastic. The earthquake engineering, the performance-based engineering seems to play a significant role. And that is, in fact, something that you are burdened to research on behalf of JRC. Now, one thing that I really like, JRC is like a scientific institute within the European Commission. Exactly, yes. It's like a scientific hub within the family of the European Commission. Yes, it is the only one within the European Commission. Yes, because all the other director generals are doing policy work. But somehow they need the scientific advice coming from the EU. Maybe I'm ignorant, but I've just learned that. I didn't know that the EU has its own scientific resources. And that's very reassuring to know that Commission is using science and scientists like you to guide their decisions. And I truly hope they are being guided by this science. You have positioned Eurocodes as some sort of a success story for European Commission. We all know Eurocodes have their fire parts. You said the Commission cannot directly impose laws for countries as the fire safety is national prerogative. But through Eurocodes, that actually kind of happened because the European Commission presented a very convenient way to do structural fire engineering with Eurocodes, allowing some sort of freedom for countries because each can make its own national annex. Is this the optimal way for European Commission to affect the fire safety over the Europe, or are there any other ideas? Because I think Eurocodes worked quite well in this. Indeed. Okay, so the Eurocodes as standards, as European standards, they are produced and published by SEN. This is the European Commission for Solidarization. So they're not a direct product of the European Commission. So they are published by SEN, which is a European organization, non-profit private organization, being supported by the EU member states, how? Through the national standardization bodies. So each European member state has a national standards body that is directly involved in the work by SEND. So SEND works independently, preparing the European standards. CERN will not do the work on its own. It responds to requests by industry, by practitioners, and even by the European Commission. Now that we are talking about standards, actually the Eurocodes are in the process of evolution. The first generation was published and now we are almost there to the second generation. And this second generation comes because there was a mandate by the European Commission asking for new standards, for new Eurocodes and for enhancing their use in certain new demands and covering new topics. So there is, I would say, quite a direct communication between the European Commission and CES. So this is how some standards the European Commission is, I would say, working around CES, which is regulated by the EU member states. The Eurocodes are standards, so it's up to the member states to decide their status, leave them as standards, or make them obligatory through insertion, incorporation in the national regulatory system. So it's up to the country and the specificities of the regulatory system. But still, the European Commission had a say because they issued the mandate to do them. Exactly, yes. So they said, we need them because... We need them because of, yes, we need them because we need a common language, because we need common design practices, we need engineers to be able to work from one country to the other, to support the single market. And I would assume a similar process has happened post Grenfell, or maybe it was even before Granville, for the harmonized European facade testing method. This was also something... Yes, exactly. Exactly. Yes, started again, started from European Commission and again from DigiGround. Exactly. Okay, so European Commission indeed, maybe it does not finish their work, but it sets up what's being worked on. And I think that's super important. And many of us, people listening, the guests of the show, have been on various CN committees. We know how it looks from the inside doing the standard work. But the world, you know, of the Brussels is very remote. And even if your Brussels is located in Northern Italy in the lovely landscape, it's still somewhat unaccessible for us mortals. Not really, because we at the JRC, there are so many visitors every day, experts in various fields to discuss with the JRC scientists on topics related to the work we are doing. So it's a really it's an accessible site. It's it's it feels different than Brussels. It sounds so much better than Brussels. Like you got me at the northern Italy part and now I just love it. So we know what JRC is, how European Commission is in the back of the legislation process over Europe, what's its role. Now, you started with Grenfell 2017 that issued a huge shift in thinking for the European Commission. So how was the catastrophe at Grenfell perceived and how did it trigger further actions of your group? and how did it trigger further actions of your group? Okay, and sorry, I take one step back also, because we said that the European Commission kind of influences and supports the development of standards. And going back to the Eurocodes, when such standards are published, then the European Commission took action supporting facilitative implementation through the development of tools, through education, through training, through dissemination. So the Commission does not stop with the development of self-implementation, then takes action, making sure that these are properly implemented, because having them just published doesn't really mean anything. So support implementation within Europe and outside where there is such. So because this also relates on fire safety, engineering and any possible harmonization in the future. So having done this work and having fire safety, you know, in the radar, there comes the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. It was really almost shocking to see this incident and the European Commission, DigiGrow, took immediate action and launched what is called the Fire Information Exchange Platform, FIAP. What is FIAP? It is what the name says. It's an initiative, a platform facilitating cooperation says it's initiative a platform facilitating cooperation of member states representatives bringing together all stakeholders in the world of fire safety design that would be fire safety practitioners engineers national authorities firefighters so breaking together all these experts all these experts to exchange best practices, lessons learned, data, challenges, what is lacking, and what is really needed in the near future, or discussing the long-term vision. So, not regulating anything, but really collecting ideas and experiences, because this was really lacking in the world of fire safety design. And at what point did performance-based fire safety engineering fall into the radar of this thinking? It was during the first meeting of the FIIP platform. So FIIP is launched, is announced. There is a wide call for participation. It went really well because people from the fire safety engineering, and not from the fire safety world, actually, came together. There is the first meeting and discussing what would be the most important, I would say, work streams of work. So what should we focus on? And among the topics of focus, including data, there comes fire safety engineering, meaning fire performance-based design. comes fire safety engineering, meaning fire performance-based design. It comes there as a specific request under the FIAP initiative to look into fire safety engineering. And what this means for Europe, how to use, what is it? It was actually a term used in the first meeting and then a huge question mark. What is it? What is this? Why to look into this? And then you come in and you say it's easy, and then five years later we have the report. More or less you're right because it's five years later. So, what happened after that first meeting, fire safety engineering, there comes the word engineering, and there comes DigiGrow calling JRC, hey guys, you're engineers. You're structural engineers, but can you help us? You have experience with the construction sector, with supporting the development of standards. You have a huge experimental laboratory facility, the largest in Europe. Can you help us? And we said, yes, we shall. We thought at the time, ready for the challenge. Yes, we can help. We can use the experience of the Eurocodes. We have a bit of understanding of fire safety design because of the Eurocodes fire parts. We have been dealing with structural fire design. And we have in our mind this idea of flexible standards because these are the Eurocodes. The Eurocodes, and this is why they are a success story, they give the guidelines, but allowing to countries freedom of choice where it is necessary, like actions, snow, geological conditions, seismic hazard. seismic hazard. So there is a lot of choices by the member states implementing the EuroCos. These are not fixed codes. There is the standard and then there is a national annex, which describes the choices by each country. So we say we think that with this mentality, the flexibility of standards, perhaps we can approach the issue of fire safety design and looking into fire safety engineering. So we said, yes, let's start this work. This was about 2018. Between, you know, discussions and agreements, that was more or less 2018. And at JRC, us, a team of, at the time, three engineers, civil engineers, started looking into the issue of fire safety engineering. Studying, going to events to understand what is happening, being in contact with experts to try to see what we are talking about. And there comes the idea that this is a matter of collaboration, again, of exchanging ideas, because we understand that there are differences in between the member states. There are different ideas. Each country is in a different state of understanding and implementation and practices. So we say we need to bring more expertise into this work. more expertise into this work. And in 2019, so you see how time passes by studying and looking into the topic. We are already in 2019 and JRC establishes an expert network on fire safety engineering, which is our angel network, because these are the experts on fire safety design, helping us with the work. This expert network, coordinated by the JRC, it's a small network, so we are not, this is not like the FIAT. FIAT is really wide participation exchange of ideas. The network, it's more of a small network of experts from academia, industry, and firefighters. Experts on fire safety engineering. So we are a bit, you know, focusing on the topic, on performance-based design. And we call these people, at the beginning there were about 10, then it kind of expanded. We have 15 to 20 experts in the network to discuss the problem, the issue, and to see how do we need really set a framework of work. What are we doing? How? Why? In the report, there's an annex A where you can find out who these mysterious experts are. And it is a brilliant group of engineers, scientists, a really great mix of experts from different CEN committees, from different European universities, from large laboratories, from fire brigade. For such a small group, a very diverse mix of experiences and backgrounds and definitely knowledge. So you as a group of engineers not coming from the world of fire, you meet this group of fire experts. One thing I cannot understand, how did you make them work on one coherent document? It must have been so hard to achieve what you have achieved because what you have achieved is truly mapping the performance-based fire safety engineering throughout the whole European Union, including UK at that point. So it also maps UK system. This is something I've never seen in my career that someone has managed to truly be an overview that includes all views from Hungary to Spain to Sweden. That's brilliant. So tell me how this work did look like when you were preparing that. Talking about that really great group of experts, it is really important to say that they are working on a voluntary basis, It's really important to say that they are working on a voluntary basis, which is an interesting point because they all have their daily jobs. They are all passionate about fire safety design, and they are working with JRC on a voluntary basis, so sharing expertise. So not wanting to impose an extra work, an extra workload, what we were doing with them, we were kind of extracting their knowledge, they're extracting their views, and us and JRC doing the work in terms of collecting information, mapping the situation, and writing down our observations. So we made them a bit work for us by sharing their expertise and their views. them a bit work for us by sharing their expertise and their their views it was obvious from the first meeting of the of the network that what we are lacking is is data and information on the situation because we started looking for information about what is happening in europe concerning fire safety engineering performance fire safety design. We found some great relevant works by CEN TC 127, but ISO TC 92. There were some surveys on the status of FSC, but these were targeting specific countries. So they were not targeting whole Europe because at the time I suppose it was not possible. They were mostly dealing with countries that traditionally are, I would say, experts in fire safety engineering. So they were not addressing whole Europe. And we said from the first meeting that we need to understand what is happening in every single country in Europe. And to extend this, to include as many countries as possible that are involved in SANE. So, standardization in the European region. So, that's why you will see also Ukraine, you will see also Serbia in the report. To see countries that are involved with SANE tax committees and see what is happening. Discussing with the network, how to do this. And comes the idea, we need to do an inquiry. We need to go to the fire regulators in the EU member states and the countries and get their feedback. We need to be in a direct discussion with them because they're the ones that know exactly what is happening in their own countries. So the idea comes 2019, we will do an inquiry on fire safety engineering status and implementation needs. And this is how the whole story of collecting data started. Obviously, the idea was to do the inquiry through an online questionnaire. That was the easy choice. But then the question was, what would be the questions? Who would be the targeted responders? What are we dealing with? Are we dealing with everything ready to fire safe engineering? Are we somehow trying to frame this? So this is again how the experts, the network, help us, help JRC by pointing us to the right direction, by giving us their view. So this is how we have been using the network and we managed to do the work and write the report. At the beginning, I had an impression that you coming from the structural engineering world, your view of fire safety and what fire safety is would be somewhat related to structural fire engineering. And now you're thrown into the world of detection, evacuation, smoke toxicity, material properties. It's probably a very challenging world to enter. But this is also why your views on this are very valuable for us, for the fire safety community, because we're all close in our bubbles, in our silos. Everyone from us, fire safety engineers, comes from a certain education and background, which imposes some inevitable biases on you. It's very difficult to study fire safety engineering as a whole thing, because you're always biased in some way. You may have been biased towards structural fire engineering, I would assume, but probably as you discovered more and more features of fire safety, this probably altered your view. Now, an important question is, but why? Okay, you want to map the fire safety engineering, but why European Commission felt it is necessary to map it at this detail? Or was it just your individual decision that, okay, we need to map it at details because otherwise we lose the view? It was kind of a combination. It was performance fire safety design. It was performance fire safety design. It was in, I would say, in the list of actions of the Commission to look into this idea, because perhaps this can help performance-based design was a bit already incorporated in our mentality, because this is how we design structures for structural design. So we are used to performance-based design, so it was a bit incorporated. Having the commission not in the place to regulate fire safety, but in the place to support training, education, sharing data. If we didn't map the situation, we couldn't decide on the next action. So if we didn't know exactly what was happening, how could we support, provide recommendations? So it was, I would say, complete lack of information was the trigger to collect data in such a way. As a cornerstone for building up the next actions to really map out where are we. Exactly. Holistically viewing everything from sprinklers to structural fire engineering and evacuation. Exactly. And also, we had inspiration. When we were looking into our previous studies on fire safety engineering, we noticed that in all these studies, the field was actually broken into technical areas. So we saw immediately that we cannot talk about fire safety engineering with just one word. We need to break this into the technical areas, strength, compartmentation, structural engineering. So we need to break this into and to understand what's the situation in every technical area. Because it could be that in one area, engineers are really using a performance-based design, but in another area... I can give you a very quick example from Poland where, for example, smoke control would be fully performance-based. Like literally in the law, it says you should design the system so it provides safe evacuation without really going much further into it. So it's fully performance-based objective. Whereas, for example, structural engineering, it would be fully prescribed and operating only in fire resistance, not some sort of load-bearing capacity in fire or any other aspects. Okay, you can go Eurocodes. But still, the basic regulations are very prescriptive-based. So I guess every country would differentiate in a way. From the summary, actually, FireSafe Europe published a very nice and short summary of this report. It seems that most of the countries have some sort of fire safety engineering application. However, it's super scattered. What was your bird's eye view on that? Does really everyone have something, but everywhere is different? Exactly, because when we were collecting data, and I can come back later on how difficult it was to collect the data in the end. But the first, you know, analysis we did was a map of Europe and showing each country if FSC is allowed or not allowed. You know, a very simple question you had in the inquiry. Is it allowed to use FSC approach for fire safety designs in your country? Yes or no? And there we saw immediately that the answer was yes, that in theory, in principle, an engineer is allowed within the Latin framework to use fire safety engineering approach. However, when going deeper into technical areas, or are you really using fire safety engineering, then the scatter is huge. So going from yes, most countries are using, are allowed to use FSC, going to not really, we're not using. We are using only in very specific cases or really not in any case. So when we start breaking, you know, making the analysis and breaking the assets into the details and the technical areas, not really. There are countries that are more than 60%, I would say, performance-based design, even fully. And there are countries that are practically using prescriptive approaches, 100%, despite having SSA approach allowed. But your mapping also goes the other way, and I really enjoyed that way, that you've also mapped where prescriptive design is used and what regulations actually are guiding that in a particular country. And maybe you have not intended this as an output of your report, but that's a very useful like a cheat sheet for an internationally working engineer to quickly take a look on what type of regulations to expect, for example, when I go to Slovenia. Exactly, exactly. Because, you know, when we were doing this work, we were used to the Eurocode. So we were used to the idea that we have exactly an engineer changing a country and doing the design of a bridge could go to the Eurocode again and having the same, you know, family of standards and can do the work. So we say, what about fire cycle design? Can we have a Th-PAL list of the main regulation in its member state? So what would the engineer use? Is it working in Slovenia, in Italy, or France? And it was interesting because we saw that in some countries, in most countries, I would say, in the last 10 years, there have been new regulations published. New, improved, extended, but there was some movement. However, still not a word about performance-based design. So even though they were publishing new regulation, still the performance-based design idea was not really present. Or if it was present, no tools are available to support design with such an approach, which was, again, a huge challenge. law but can affect actions at various levels. So I would see two of such levels. One is education and second being the certification licensing, the fire safety profession. Were there also things that you were trying to map out when doing this study? So perhaps you were present in one of our internal meetings and when we were discussing the long-term vision or what's next, yes, And when we're discussing the long-term vision or what's next, yes, that's the idea. That the next step after the report is to look into education and training to see how the commission can facilitate education and training and what about certification. And this is why we had the questions regarding these two topics in the inquiry, to understand what is happening. And now we are trying a bit with the answers too. We did the mapping, but now we're doing the grouping. So we want to see common trends, to have countries in one group saying, okay, in these countries, there is some experience and expertise, let's say, with education and training. In these countries, we see almost nothing. In this other group, there's something happening. So try to group the countries and also see what each country is doing in the certification level. See if there is a framework. And if there is a framework, is there any common trend? Or we are really talking about harmonizing from structure, you know, starting from the basis and working on qualifications. But in this study, you have done mapping, but you have not done assessing. You just show what countries are doing. You're not saying, okay, Italians have figured out this part, but the Flanders or Belgian government has a really good approach to this. No, you're just mapping. And I would assume a view of what's working, what's not working. It's somehow a future work, is it? Exactly. Yes, yes, yes. And it's also interesting to note that when we were doing this inquiry, one question we had to address and decide is who would be answering to this inquiry. So is it a wide inquiry? So we are opening the inquiry to all Polish fire safety practitioners and asking their views, or we go to the fire, to the principal fire regulator of each country. So do we want views or do we need mostly facts? What is happening? And same previous studies going along the path of collecting views from the experts, we took the other path. So we say no, we want in principle one answer per country from the national authority. And this is what I said previously. I will come back to the challenges in collecting data. Who is this person? Who is the principal fire regulator? Who is doing this job? And this was difficult. And this is why we were collecting data answers for one year. The inquiry was launched in November 2020, for one year. The inquiry was launched in November 2020 and we closed having collected answers from all countries we were targeting October 2021. And did you have any mechanism to reassure that this person is representative to the country or this questioner is representative? How were you verifying the data? Okay, so initially when we reached out to the fire regulators, there is a group managed by DigiGrow, which is within the construction family of groups under DigiGrow. It's a subgroup on fire. So every country has an official nomination for a fire expert to advise DigiGrow. So these were our first contact points. This is the person we reached out to. All these persons are national authorities. So they are not just a fire expert. They're working for the ministry or for the fire brigade, which is responsible for fire safety designs, review, and regulation. So we went to these experts. In some cases we received a response right away, and this was a response in many cases consulted within the organization of the country, so it was by one person, but consulted within the group of the fire regulators. In some other cases, it was really impossible to get a response because that person was not responding or was already in a different position, you know, not dealing with fire safety. And once again, this is when the network, the expert network helped us. So we said, hey, guys, we are lacking responses from X countries. Can you help us identify who would be the right person to answer, having the official authority. And this is how, you know, with word of mouth, through experts, we reached to the right person in this country. That took one year. It was really difficult to get the right person. But everybody that answered is within part of the national authority. But everybody that answer is within part of the National Authority. In front of my eyes, I have the graphics. And by the way, the visual part of the report is mind-blowing. It is beautiful. I really enjoyed reading the report, and I really enjoyed the infographic style of data presented in it. Because we are talking here about very difficult statistics, very complicated, very challenging to understand. And the way how it is presented is a masterpiece. And if anyone does not care about fire safety engineering in Europe, you're welcome to not care but you should just check it for the graphics as well. I have the graphics in front of my eyes showing the responses from countries, and most of the map is covered with a single response. There is two responses from France, which I understand were different responses, which is kind of funny. Yes, this was the issue, yes. I see there are parts of Germany and Flanders region, which issued a separate response from their country, which I also find interesting. So definitely these are the things you have to take into account when you are mapping fire safety. Yes, because we had some conflicting national authorities saying, no, we aren't the authority to answer. No, not really, aren't the authority to answer. No, not really. We are the authority. So this is why we've seen some cases in this issue. And out of 34 countries mapped, only four were not showing any allowance for fire safety engineering. It was Portugal, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Greece. How did you feel about Greece not having performance-based engineering? You know, okay, another thing to share with the audience is that, hi in Greek, if you check the other co-authors, one is from Portugal and the other one is from Bulgaria. So the core group of authors were coming from countries not allowing FEC approach. Really, it was disappointing, but also it allowed us a bit to go deeper and really confirm that what the answer was is true, because we could directly discuss with the responders and confirm that indeed it's not allowed. Because thinking about the Euroclubs, in some cases, FEC, it is practically allowed, at least for structural engineering. So the response was a bit questionable. But the thing is, in these four countries, also Slovakia, there is no regulatory framework allowing. So the absence of allowance, of really saying it is allowed, it means no, it's not allowed. So it's also a matter of um interpretation so again so we are this group of three um engineers researchers greece portugal and bulgaria and i have to give credits for the visuals that you just commented on the short also francesa chiaretta because she was the she's the fire expert in the group. And her help in the visuals was really instrumental because we run the analysis many, many times. We produce many, many visuals, you know, trying to see if I see it, will it make sense? Or someone will have to go really in detail with the report. And Francesca, she really worked on having these visuals in a way that are meaningful. Fantastic. Because it's a lot of data. And also, we kind of did a bit of trial and error procedure. Since we were collecting data for one year, we didn't wait until the end of this period to run the analysis. We say, okay, we have eight answers. We do our analysis just period to run the analysis. We say, okay, we have eight answers. We do our analysis just to see what the situation is. We go and present the analysis to relevant events. So we even went to present the results, printing the results in conferences, in events in Brussels, even before collecting answers from everybody. It helped because we were also assessing their reactions. Is the message clear or we need to rethink the analysis? So that helped a lot because in the beginning it was very overwhelming. How do we present all this? Okay, we have our questions. How to do it? It is very overwhelming. I guess we're going to stop talking about the report contents itself. I will just tell the audience that it goes really in-depth, like which countries are using performance-based engineering in terms of smoke control, detection, sprinklers. It goes very, very deep into narrow things used throughout Europe. The questionnaire itself, which is also a part of the report, was very detailed. And if you go and read the report on your own, I would highly require first going to check the questionnaire because that will quickly let you understand what is the data collected and what can you understand, what can you find in the report, and then go through the analysis showing the replies and the statistical distributions and the differences. It's really interesting to take a look on the picture of ourselves, our fire safety family in Europe. But now, I don't want to talk about the report to not run out of time because I really want to talk about conclusions. And I think that's the most important thing. Your first conclusion refers to the state of fire safety engineering. And I think we've covered a lot of that in our discussion so far. So next are three things, education, standardization, and future work. Let's start with education. future work. Let's start with education. So viewing this from the holistic perspective of the whole of Europe, what are the findings of the report and your recommendations towards educating the next generation of fire safety engineers in Europe? Okay, so the first point that came up is that there is no harmonized educational framework. So there is not necessarily a university-level course on fire safety engineering throughout Europe. There is in some countries, there is not in some other countries. Either a specific course, a master's-level course. So each country has a very specific situation. Being said that, there is no educational framework harmonized across Europe. There is no certification qualification network. Again, it's not harmonized because these are really interlinked and this was obvious. So, education and qualification framework are linked. If you don't provide education, you cannot really work or enforce a certification and qualification framework. Sorry, what kind of actions can European Commission take to resolve that? We have great examples of really successful education in Europe. International Masters of Fire Safety Engineering, I know Bart Messier was one of your secret experts in your group. So you had access to the best educators in Europe. How can European Commission act on that? The first way would be to share the best practice examples. So, again, it's through our report and through, you know, communication actions to share the best practice examples. Say, we have X and Y examples of education. So, let's see how they're doing and ask with experts to present how the program was structured, how all the actions were structured. So sharing the examples. And linking this again to qualifications framework. So again, sharing what is being done in some countries. Would this actually fit throughout Europe or thinking about how to harmonize? So I will say start a bit lighter. What if we try to set up a harmonization framework for qualifications? Can we propose something, something that works in some countries, perhaps giving some flexibility and trying to apply this in every EU member state. Actually, this is why in the inquiry, we also asked the responders their views and not facts anymore about education needs. So we asked them, do you see a need for education and training in your country? The vast majority said yes. And the U.S. should admit at university level, at postgraduate level, firefighters, training courses. There, there was a mix of responses. So practically, they said yes to everything. Yes, we need training in all levels, which makes sense because each one, the engineers, the fire brigade, they have a different role. So it makes sense to ask for training in all levels. If trained to obtain a licensure or certificate or any approval, formal approval to do fire safety engineering in your country, it's interesting that different countries also have very different systems. Some would have national authorities, some would have fire brigade that is dictating solutions, so we have local authorities. In Poland, we have very strong fire safety experts, the chartered ones, and it's like governmental chartered, not some sort of group or institution that would give chartership. It's a very difficult place to harmonize, but I guess the soft actions as promoting best practices and promoting good examples that work, I see this as a huge possibility to advance further. Yes, we need to take small steps to get to the long vision. Because going back now to 2018, you know what was the first idea we had as engineers at the JRC? I said a fire safety coach. So we said that word, that term in the beginning. And after being involved in this work, we say no. We are not in the place. We are not ready to talk about a fire safety code. We can talk about harmonization of procedures in design, in education, in training and qualification framework. Because a European fire safety code perhaps would be something, I don't know, in 50 years time, even further in the future, but harmonization seems feasible. So again, as a next step, now I work on a study, I would call it, on FSC education at university professional level to see what's, again, the situation using the inquiry and perhaps also doing a new inquiry, but not now for the fire regulators, but to the experts that are involved in education and training. Compare the paths to educate FS engineers to understand the tasks. The fire engineer is asked to perform in its country. So to understand what the fire engineer is doing or not doing. And this is how to go further. Again, it would be, as you see, it's again a mapping exercise, but this is one of the most important activities in the Commission before taking any action. Maping, comparing and understanding. You're completely ruining my views of bureaucracy at the European level now because this sounds reasonable. And as you can imagine, my view was a little opposite of that. So thank you for that. Okay. The next thing, standardization and research needs. So you said the code is, if we had the Eurofire code, that's probably a half decade ahead, which means it's probably not going to happen ever. Maybe, like, you know, sometimes we get this period of bravery when in three years we do something that 50 years could not accomplish. Maybe we will have such a period of bravery in the European fire safety family, but it doesn't look it's going to happen very, very soon. And now you've recognized the needs in standardization and research. You actually put that in the same paragraph. So let's go there. Yes, because, OK, yes, we put that in the same paragraph from the work. These were, again, the views of the regulators. But I think it is important because they express what they are missing, what they see as lucky. From the report, we identified topics for standardization. So trying a bit to frame what to do next. And I think standardization and research, they are a bit interlinked. Okay, research comes first, and then standards take the outcome of research, put it into a code. But what we saw, most responders were asking for design fires and fire scenarios. They see this really lacking if there is the way to implement fire safety engineering approach, fire safety performance, and acceptance criteria. There is a long list, but these were, let's say, the top topics identified as research and standardization needs. So for us at the JRC, this is also a matter of, let's say, assessment, because in the research part, there can be also some support. At JRC, there are huge experimental facilities. Yes, there is the expertise in structural and earthquake engineering. But lately, there have been also some work on fire, even at the JRC. some work on FHIR, even at the JRC. So there is one thing about even research that could be even done at JRC, but then there are so many European institutions, you know, capable to go the research a bit further. Does this mean that somewhere on the horizon there would be a CEN subgroup devoted to this, something like ISO TC92? There is already. There is CENTICI 127. 127, okay. And there is a working group within the 127 on fire safety engineering. Right, yeah. But they are not doing research. They are trying to see how to take all the outcomes of research and put them in a standard or in a umbrella. They call sometimes document on performance-based fire design. So there is, but as with all standards production, it takes time because it requires consensus. Yeah. And with the consensus, it is challenging. I asked it because now that you mentioned that I sent one to seven, of course, there's the group by Daniel Jouer and other groups. Exactly. Closer was a part of your expert network. There are these groups, but we do not have a standard on design fires. We do not have a standard on smoke yields. We do not have a standard on human travel speeds and factors that influence that. This is all knowledge that you can gain only through scientific literature and maybe resources like SFP handbook or other renowned pieces. So it would be great if this could be standard. I'm saying that as a member of a group that develops the standards for smoke control. And in our groups, we spend considerable amount of time discussing design fires, which we should probably not do because it's not. We should define how to calculate the mass flow through a vent, not calculate how one should define the fire. But we need because it's undefined. And without this definition, we're unable to really provide performance-based engineering in this field. So I appreciate that this is a recognized area for future development. But in terms of just general safety engineering path or performance-based engineering, was there any recommendation that maybe a standard on performance-based engineering should come to life or not really? I'm not afraid like this. Maybe it's too early, but there was the coming, as I would say, recommendation, observation from the report that the regulators are asking for the allowance of FSC approach in fire design, especially in cases where prescriptive approaches cannot be applied. We are not talking about just residential buildings, because in the report you also see cases in which countries are using FSC because there is nothing more. So the recommendation is that there is a request for performance-based design allowance in fire safety design and the request to have the appropriate tools to apply performance-based design. So there is a lack of tools and a request to develop such tools and being available through standards, guidelines, manuals, somewhere documented so that fire engineers can use them. I'm not sure if we need a European standard on that because resources exist. There's a very good German standard that has been published in English and revised in German. Hope we get the revision somewhat soon. SFP has been championing performance-based engineering for years, and now we have established SFP Europe. And SFP is working hard on the revision of performance-based engineering code, which is going to be ANSI code in the US. So a lot of efforts are already happening, and I believe you would get more for your euros spent researching the missing points that you've just mentioned and they are probably the more difficult ones to obtain than the framework. Exactly, exactly. This is one of the reasons why we dropped the idea of a European fire safety code because there are already detector committees working on something similar, either in Europe or internationally. There is expertise in USA. And so we said we should not produce something from zero. We need to see what is happening. And perhaps to say we are missing design fires, for example, and let's put together all the research, all that field in one document, in a standard, in a guideline. So it is exactly as you said, there is a lot of work done, but I think it is not clearly documented. It is not always easy to find what is happening. And because I'm thinking about, you know, single engineers in English, that they are not really allowed to apply SSC approach, but they are dealing with a building that cannot be designed with a prescriptive method. So where should they turn to? What to use? So I'm thinking the engineer, it would be good to have documents giving all the information necessary. Of course, then you have the engineering judgment. It will be the engineer to assess how to use the information, but let's give the information to them. My prediction for the next 20, 30 years, if I'm in any place to make predictions, but my prediction is that almost every building will be innovative. The technology is moving so quickly. Design solutions are moving so quickly. And they are so interlocked together, you know. A change in building envelope leads to a completely different energy performance, which you can then combine with a specific energy source, a specific heat management system that leads to completely different requirements in ventilation, moisture control, glazing, everything changes. And it's very connected to this particular building because a different building which just has a different detail of its envelope may have the whole further domino set up completely different way. And both will affect fire safety in a very specific way, in a different way. And their prescriptive codes are in no position to handle that because they would become so complex. They would become performance-based engineering themselves in a way. So I see a bright future for fire safety engineering in Europe. Now, for the final conclusion, what's the future? What's the direct future work, the next one step that's probably already happening at the commission, at the JRC? Where are we heading now? Okay, so first thing is that CF, the Fire Information Exchange Platform, is active, and it's doing a lot of dissemination work. So there are webinars, conferences, events, and whoever is interested or work in the area of fire safety design is mostly welcome to participate, to join CF. So this is one task and it goes forward. The expert network run by JRC is active and we will continue the collaboration with them. And then JRC is still entrusted with the work on fire safety engineering, so it goes forward. And now we are in the face of generating the report uh as widely as possible because it is important to collect feedback so this podcast is is great presenting the report in scientific conferences and fora is also important and we want the feedback so we don't just want people saying great report and stopping there. We want them to share their views. Also, the next slide is about educational training, qualification frameworks, finding that missing link between education and licensing and qualifications, recognize trans countries. So what I said about the privacy, previously about grouping, especially with fire design approval process, who does what. Even work a bit on definitions and terminology on fire safety engineering. There is work done by ISO 1392 in this field, but it came also out from the questionnaire. What is a fire safety consultant really? And what is a fire safety consultant really and what is a fire safety engineer? What is it? I mean, do we agree? We started with this question. We started with this exact question on the podcast, yes. Do we know? I don't think so. And identify big gaps and best practices. So bring to life best practices and see what the big gaps and trying to close them. And also, again, going back to education, the different paths of education offered by countries and then harmonize. So we continue, I would say, along the same path, what comes out from the report. So we work on the conclusions and trying now to assess them and to collect more information on the conclusions. And also it was a big discussion, we should further understand the reasons for non-allowance or the practical non-use of FSA. But I think this will be strongly to education and expertise in the end. Fantastic. Adamantia, thank you so much. I think it was a priceless interview for anyone interested in performance-based fire safety engineering in Europe or anywhere, as it gives a very unique insight to how things are being made and very reassuring to understand that science is the base of developments in Europe. I can't believe this. It's amazing. It's like it should be. Wow. I'm glad because I'm sure you said it and I would say the same some years ago. I'm sure people don't understand what is happening in the Commission or behind the scenes. There are so many regulations coming out but really in many cases not in all cases there is some science behind and it's just good to be part in that um of that process brilliant thank you thank you for having me in the show and maybe in in a future show i would be able to say I came a bit closer to fire safety engineering ideas and concepts. To call myself perhaps I don't know, not a fire safety engineer, but a bit more knowledgeable in the field. You are the best fire safety engineer among earthquake engineers I know, so you can hold that title for now. Okay, I take this title. And maybe you want to experiment in yourself with a proper fire safety engineering curriculum and find out what works and what does not. Adamantia, once again, thank you so much. And that's it. Thank you, Adamantia, for coming to the Fire Science Show. It was a huge pleasure to have you and share some insight on how European Commission and its research arm, the Joint Research Center, works. I find myself ignorant. I had no idea it works like this. And the episode was really reassuring in the way that European Commission actually uses science and knowledge to create new regulations and maybe not create regulations, but to issue requests for new regulations, and then once the regulations are put in place or once codes are being created, they have so many ways to affect how they are shared and used within Europe. So a very interesting view, a very refreshing, plus the work they've done on the report is just astonishing. You really have to take a look into the report. If this interview did not convince you that you need to take a look into the report, I have no idea how to convince you even more, but it's really worth the time just to skim through it and see where are we with fire safety engineering in Europe. So thank you very much for being here with me. There are some great stuff coming next weeks for you, so I better get back to my production studio and start working on those. So much material to work on. In the meantime, if you enjoyed this show, I would highly appreciate if you could leave me a five-star review in your podcast application of your choice or maybe on my website. These things go a long way. So as always, I highly request that you do that. And I also request that you share this show with your friends who may be interested in fire safety. That's it for today. Thank you so much for being here with me. See you for listening and see you soon.
