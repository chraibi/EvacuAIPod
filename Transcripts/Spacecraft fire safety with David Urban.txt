 Everybody, welcome to the FireSense show, session 75. Great to have you here. Today is a very exciting episode for me because we're going to talk about spacecraft fire safety and fires in space. That's something that or at least the part about the space travel is something that was with me through my entire life and always loved rockets and spaceships and space travel and now I got to talk to someone from NASA. That's amazing. I've invited Dr. David Urban from NASA Glenn Research Center, who has been involved with multiple space exploration missions and fire safety of them, development of fire safety of spacecraft and also researching fires and microgravity and low gravity environments. So a very knowledgeable person about how does the practice of delivering fire safety to space objects or spacecraft look like. Amazing. And it's super fun because, you know, stuff that we take for granted, that smoke goes upward, well, forget about it. It does not. No gravity. I lost everything about it, so I really hope you will enjoy this episode maybe less practical than usual fire science your episodes but definitely on the upper boundary of excitement and interesting facts about fire science so yeah very very worth an hour of your time but before we jump into the episode i wanted to share some stuff about the podcast. So I've introduced a new interesting thing for you. I have opened Ask Me Anything pod on the site. It's a place in the website of the podcast that you can actually send me a voicemail. In that voicemail, you can send me either a question, a commentary, a view on something that we've discussed on the podcast. I want to hear your voice. I want to hear what you have to say about what you've heard on the podcast. And maybe you disagree with something. Maybe you agree with something. Maybe something needs a different point of view. Maybe in your professional experience, something works completely different. Or maybe you can tell us about how to use the technology that we have discussed on the show and we have not covered in a way that you know. So I'm super curious about what you have to say and what you would like to comment. I want this to be something that would be a monthly, let's say, no pressure there. I'll do it as often as you want. But let's start with the monthly Ask Me Anything sessions where I'll record an additional podcast episode that will air on the end of the month in which I will play these questions. I'll try to answer them. I'll play the commentary. I'll try to discuss with them. If it touches some points that were on previous podcast episodes i'll try to invite the guests to give a short answer to the questions or commentary post so i think it could be quite a nice opportunity to to have a discussion with you all and see what you like about the show what you don't like about the episodes what are your points of view because from the letters i get in email you have very often very very good good points. And from discussions on Twitter or LinkedIn, so many interesting aspects that are happening around the episodes. And of course, I'm just covering one point of view. It's my point of view. I don't know yours. So here's the chance. So yours is also even an airspace in the podcast. And if you like it, if it works, we're eventually going to increase the length of the incoming voicemails, maybe increase the intensivity of that. I hope you like this way of participating. Oh, and if you're stressed about sending a voicemail that I will air in here, you can always just send me a text message to the comment form on the podcast website. So either way, it will reach me and I'll try to work with that. So very looking forward to your commentary, to your questions, to your opinions, and looking forward to recording this additional podcast episode for you to have a way to discuss with you. And now, well, I am at the length of the introduction and there's a hell of a great podcast episode just after the music. So let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm today here with Dr. David Urban, Chief Altax, Low Gravity Exploration Technology Branch at NASA. Hello, David. Great to have you in the podcast. Hello. It's really great to be here. I enjoy your show. Thank you so much. I'm so excited, overly excited. Audience will find this disturbing, the amount of excitation in my voice because I'm the second best thing after fire is spacecraft. And in my childhood, it was probably the opposite. And I always wanted to be an astronaut. Now, I'm a fire scientist. It's a decent path of career, but boy, being a fire scientist at NASA must be a very interesting path. Actually, how did you end up doing this? Did you always wonder how it will be to set things on fire in space? What brought you to the position you are today? As a graduate student, I focused on combustion phenomena. In that case, it focused on combustion phenomena. Okay. And in that case, it was for oil recovery. And then my graduate work, my postdoc, sorry, was basically an air pollution issue from petroleum. Okay. And then I was looking for jobs in combustion. I had the wonderful opportunity to be recruited by NASA, Glenn. And when I came on, it was primarily, the focus was more on fundamental combustion in low gravity and with a sideline of fire safety. Over time, that shifted to my work being primarily fire safety, space-grade fire safety with a sideline of fundamental combustion, I guess is the way to describe it. It's always been really exciting, both being able to contribute to the space program, but also to be able to participate in some really exciting experiments where we can make what's normally a constant gravity a variable. And that's changed the thing, turns things on its head. I mean, if you want to increase the acceleration on the ground, you have these spinning tools that allow you to do that. But if you rotate them other way, it doesn't reduce the gravity no more. So the space for a low gravity place to do experiments on Earth is very limited, let's say. In the history of space exploration, the fire is a part of the history also in a kind of tragic way. And I know the story of Apollo 1 where the astronaut crew died during a fire on the ground, actually. And I know these stories change the way how space industry works with relation to fire. So maybe we can start there, how this tragic event shaped the fire safety view of NASA or space exploration agencies in general, maybe bring our listeners a little closer to what happened during the Apollo 1 and how it influenced everything that happened later on. Oh, yeah, it was in 1967. And prior to that, I mean, there were some accidents in oxygen chambers that might have given people warning. I mean, there's a fatal accident in the Soviet chamber in 1961, but it's generally agreed that NASA didn't appreciate the hazard due to fire, and particularly enhanced oxygen. And in the rush, there's so many challenges to do the spacecraft that did not have good control of the materials in the spacecraft cabin. And so then on a ground test, of the materials in the spacecraft cabin. And so then on a ground test, so they were in the challenges, up through Apollo, the spacecraft were pure oxygen in flight. In flight, it was only about three and a half pounds total pressure. But on the surface, because of the outside pressure, it was near sea level, a little above air, one atmosphere. And so then they had a small arcing event inside the spacecraft. And there's a large amount of nylon netting holding stowage and whatnot in place. And it ignited that nylon netting, and that fire spread rapidly. that nylon netting, and that fire spread rapidly. And there were also issues with the cabin door, which was not readily opened with internal pressure, and so they were not able to escape in time. And so the crew were overwhelmed by the fumes before the fire ultimately ruptured the vehicle. So it totally changed NASA's perception of the fire risk, and other agencies likewise have now very strict material controls and a lot of the attention is paid to the ignitability of the materials in the spacecraft and also the atmosphere in the spacecraft. In essence, oxygen is something you need because people need to breathe and providing this pure oxygen, I guess it's for some reason optimal. If you have it under pressure, you cannot remove that. You cannot really ventilate the space. You cannot evacuate easily. That's also a thing. I guess we'll touch it later on. So you really need to control the materials. The second fire that I've read on when preparing for the episode was the fire on the Mir station, the old Soviet station after Skylab II, the outpost of humanity into space. Do you recall that fire? Yeah, I had the fortune to be part of the post-fire investigation team. Okay. So I traveled to Moscow with some other people. It was particularly important because that oxygen generation system is the backup for the ISS, International Space Station. The one that burns. Yeah. And it's a system used in commercial aircraft and in submarines. It's a perchlorate. In aircraft, it's sodium perchlorate. And that little mass pops down. In aircraft, it's sodium perchlorate, and that little mass pops down. There's a little cartridge above your head of sodium perchlorate that gets triggered off and reacts exothermically, making oxygen. And likewise, in the spacecraft, the Russian system uses lithium perchlorate. And it ends up being, for mass and long-term storage, trades better than oxygen tanks. And so it's very popular, again, on spacecraft and, again, on submarines. And so the problem was you've got an exothermic system producing pure oxygen. One could never know what the actual cause was, but it's pretty clear that it was contamination of the materials inside the canister. And so it ignited. It was dramatically frightening, vast amount of smoke, and apparently shooting hot, you know, molten metal out the end. We did a bunch of similar ones, but each one's different, so one cannot be sure exactly how theirs proceeded. But some of the ones we saw on the ground were quite threatening if you were in a volume the size of a school bus or something with this. You said the first, after the Apollo disaster, a lot of influence was put on materials. So does this mean only incombustible materials fly to space or there's certain, like, how do you approach the flammability problem? You have your own ways to test the materials to approve them? Since that period, NASA has settled on an upward flammability test where the material is subjected in its thinnest form they want to use it. In the worst case, the atmosphere is subjected to a very strong ignition source. And then there's a maximum distance it can burn after the ignition source burns out. That's deemed to be pretty conservative. You know, nothing, change the conditions, anything will burn, just about, you know. But it separates all the highly flammable objects, and then if it passes that test, you can use it extensively without any restrictions. If it fails that test, then very strict controls are put in place. And many things do fail the thing. Clothing, towels, paper all fail, and Ziploc bags. But they're deemed necessary, but they control how many of them you have and where they're stored. So you can't have a whole ton of Ziploc bags everywhere out there. Keep an eye on that. I always wondered if Scott Kelly's monkey costume on ISS was fireproof. Probably. Almost certainly not. Almost certainly not. Yeah. Yeah. Fair, fair point. There are so many things I want to ask. We will go into fire engineering spacecraft in this episode for sure. But first, one thing that I would love to ask is the combustion in space, in microgravity. I think most people would recollect this picture. I think it was a candle flame on the space station, this beautiful circular flame. It's an iconic image for fire scientists, I guess. And I've seen it multiple times in multiple different places. So let's talk how fire burns in space. It must be different. Like on the ground, it's very driven by buoyancy, by the turbulent flow that this buoyant upwards movement of flame creates. Even in your fire test, you said it's a vertical setting. So you're also very reliant on heat transfer from the flame, I guess, and stuff like that. But in space, wow, this gravity is zero or close to zero. So, you don't have that. So, tell me the physics of the flame. How does it work? I thought it was taken on the Mir space station by the astronaut Shannon Lucid collaborating with Daniel Dietrich and Professor M.T.N. at CASE on that experiment. And this really is a cool image because it really demonstrates, you know, everybody knows on Earth a candle knows which way is up. And you turn the candle, the flame always points up. It's amazing. In space, there is no up. So the shape it assumes is a blue hemisphere. base, there is no up. So the shape it assumes is a blue hemisphere. And in that case, it's dominated by diffusion because there is, you've got the stefan flow, the expanding vapor from the flame and counter, that's what the oxidizer has, oxygen has to fuse inwards of the product stream to support the flame. And so you can get, with no flow in low zero gravity, you're going to get beautiful one-dimensional spherical flames. And we have some really cool images. We've used both spherical droplet flames and spherical burner flames to study details of the flame chemistry that you really couldn't do easily on Earth. So if there's no flow, then it becomes a pure diffusion system. But before the alarms go off in a spacecraft, there's flow. We always have flow to keep the air mixed up so the crew isn't breathing a pocket of carbon dioxide, for example. And so there's a low-speed turbulent flow in the space station at all times. And so in the presence of flow, then, yeah, there is no buoyant flow, but there is the force flow. And the typical range is on the order of 20 centimeters a second in a spacecraft, which is below what you'd get from a buoyant flow in 1G. Yeah, yeah. So really you're in a different regime of burning where a buoyant flow brings in oxygen, but it also takes out energy. And so it cools the flame at the same time. So there's a U-shaped flammability boundary where at higher velocities, the flame will blow off. And then you come down to the bottom, the lower side, it loses, it's a quench, as we call it, where the heat loss puts it out. So in space, the fire risk is always worst when the flow is on, which is before you've detected it. And it's a pure oxygen setting or a mixture? Well, that varies. Before the Apollo era, it was all pure oxygen. Up through the Apollo era, it was pure oxygen at low pressure. The human physiology responds to partial pressure of oxygen, not the concentration, whereas the fire system primarily responds to partial pressure of oxygen, not the concentration, whereas the fire systems primarily respond to concentration because nitrogen will take away energy and will interfere with reaction progress. But humans need partial pressure. So it's simpler to have a one-gas system than a two-gas system in a spacecraft. So Apollo was all, four all, one gas. Now, Skylab was a different intermediate condition, but on the space station and the shuttle system and Mir and the Soyuz, the target is sea level air, but it's mixed from nitrogen and oxygen. And so that is a much safer condition. Looking forward, we're probably going to be higher concentration oxygen on the lunar habitats to enable more extravehicular activity. The crew wants to go outside in their spacesuits, very low pressure. Sorry to hear that. It's three and a half pounds pressure in the spacesuits. Oh my God. Pure oxygen. I'll recalculate that to humans. I forgot to calculate it. So it's a fifth of an atmosphere in 24. And that's to allow mobility in the spacesuits, which are soft. And so if it was one atmosphere, you wouldn't be able to move. Okay. And you'll probably bounce like crazy from everything. And the problem is if you go from sea level air to that condition, you can get decompression sickness. So they have to pre-breathe. To prevent that, they want to have less oxygen in the cabin. And to do so, they – and less nitrogen, sorry. And so that makes it more dangerous. So it's going to be about 37% oxygen on the habitats. The amount of science and consideration that goes even for this simple setting is mind-blowing. I have a follow-up question about oxygen, but I must come back to the column for a second. Why is it blue? Well, the blue means there's no sweat, and that's the subject of some incompletely studied, I guess I'd say. But in that case, the flame has slowed down enough because it's just surviving on the diffusion of oxygen into the flame. So overall, the temperature has dropped to the point where it doesn't form enough soot. It doesn't form soot. And so it doesn't... The combination of temperature and resonance time is not adequate to make soot. I wonder, is the flame thicker? And by flame, I mean this exact space in which the reactions happen. Many people don't know that, and even fire researchers do not appreciate the fact that the flame is hollow inside. There's nothing inside the flame. It's just like, I like to call it isosurface of combustion, the shape of the flame. And I once tested it by putting my iPhone inside, and I recorded it from inside, and it went viral on social media. The phone survived. So I wonder if this spherical flame, if the actual place where the reactions take place, is it, like, thicker? And is it hotter than in, like, a candle flame? Well, we didn't have good temperature profile measurements in there, but we believe it to be colder. So the flame zone, you know, where the actual peak reaction rate region is presumably thicker. And so then it would be in 1G. It tends to expand, have to expand outward. It's further away from the fuel typically than in a 1G situation because the flame boundary is looking for the balance of fuel and oxygen in stoichiometric proportion. And that tends to go further out. And then what happens is the flame gets so large that it loses energy by radiation and it goes out. But the typical candle flame, the flame itself is outside the part you can see. The high temperature zone is just outside the visible bright soot region, which is captured inside the flame, which is all very counterintuitive to people. Yeah, the deeper you go into fire science, the more of that you realize. Okay, let's go back to the oxygen question. You told me it's 20 centimeters per second. I did a quick back of an envelope calculations. meters per second. I did a quick back of an envelope calculations. If we just assume a square meter of space, if it's pure oxygen, you would have enough oxygen transported through that square meter, which is a large surface for like 400 kilowatts of fire. If it's a 38% mixture, it would be 200 ish kilowatts. And I remember in reading in one of your papers, you were testing realistic fire scenarios for a space vehicle. And there was a sentence used that we have tested a large fire, and the fire was actually 50 kilowatts. And I'm like, wow, from space perspective, this is considered a large fire, which is very interesting for me. 50 kilowatts is it's an ignition source not a fire yet you know it's a it's a trash bin and not very large one and for you from your perspective that was already a large fire event so it's a completely different perception of what's dangerous what's what's not maybe you can expand on how how did you come up with with this fire scenario and is it really a representation of a large threat a significant threat for a spaceship? Yeah, we're learning that we can be a little more tolerant of fire size by modeling. But this starts from the whole perspective that if you have that fire, the burning trash can in your typical house, you can quickly make a decision, do I dump a nearby liter of water on it or do I go out the door? Whereas in a spacecraft, out the door is not an attractive option. So then you've got to try to deal with it, and you can't get further away from it. So you're much closer to the event. And you have a lot of critical systems that could be damaged, and there's not much or very little redundancy on the system, and not much redundant air supply. So putting that all together, we have to be very intolerant of fire. So, yes, a 1G ignition source building fire is a very worrisome end state for a spacecraft. I mean, I think the Mir fire really was – I lost my calculations for that, but the heat release was not excessive from that, but it was very dramatic because it was shooting out burning steel, but the actual energy was thankfully not all that much. So yeah, so we're trying to sneak up on that and it turns out we get a good understanding of how much of the heat from a fire in a spacecraft goes to its absorption of the materials versus raising the pressure and so on. Yeah. I think the pressure is a super interesting aspect because we would not care about that that much on the ground. Our buildings are very imperfect. The amount of gaps we have in buildings in a very tightly sealed, would be very unacceptable for a spacecraft, I guess. So there's a completely different level of tightening the volume. So here, even a small fire can probably lead to very significant pressure gradients, and then you have safety measures in a spacecraft to release that pressure. So I guess even small fire can have considerable effect on the atmosphere. And it's not that when fire happens, you don't open the door to release the smoke, right? Yeah, no, it turns out they already, all spacecraft that are launched, end up having positive pressure relief valves that are quite large to prevent overpressure of the spacecraft. And those turn out to be very helpful in the event of a fire. And consequently, they relieve any excess gas and heat produced by, much of the heat and gas produced by a fire pretty quickly because they're designed for, based on the launch condition, so allowing no more than one atmosphere of delta pressure across the vehicle, or not much more. So then you go to 1.1 atmospheres. So once you get into orbit, if you're already at one atmosphere in the vehicle, you're very close to venting. So it doesn't take much for the pressure to rise to cause them to vent. That will take out excess heat with it. And so it's very helpful in the event of a fire in orbit. But those same valves, the vehicle has to go to two atmospheres total pressure if it's on the pad, which is the problem they had in Apollo 1. Okay, now you're talking about these things not just hypothetically, but I know you or NASA with your presence has done that exactly during fire missions. So I would love to talk about SAFIRE now. Okay. With your presence has done that exactly during fire missions. So I would love to talk about SAFIRE now. Okay. That was a series of experiments, large-scale experiments of controlled fires in microgravity in space. Before we go into the technicalities of SAFIRE program, how does one get an approval to burn a fire in the spacecraft, actually? You know, it was a long process. I was concerned because, I mean, we really had no perspective of what a spacecraft fire would be like. As you know, in fire science study, every occupied structure on Earth, be it a type, be it a building, a plane, a train, be it a type, be it a building, a plane, a train, an automobile, ship, submarine, you know, mines, they've done fire studies. And plus, we have a long history of experience. So there's a huge amount of data that people know versus spacecraft. We'd never done anything other than the Mir fire and Apollo 1 fire had not done any full-scale experiments. Apollo was on ground moving space. Exactly. So that was a very different case. So Mir was the only case in the spacecraft, and it was very informative, but they were not instrumented. And even the timeline is confused about this sequence. So we were searching around for a spacecraft that we could do something in that was larger than the small 5 by 10 centimeter experiments we'd done as the maximum. So we're looking around for vehicles that might be available. I looked at the Russian Progress vehicles, but they're really quite small. And then talked to the Europeans. And then ultimately, and I was looking at other alternatives, and I got laughed out of the room a number of times, until finally, a combination of circumstances, the Cygnus, a different company at the written time, but now it's north of Grumman, very interested in this possibility, and NASA itself was interested, and so we had the opportunity of a habitable vehicle. It was habitable, but had nobody in it. We'd never have them in it again. So there was no risk to people, and so we just had to make sure we didn't hurt the vehicle enough that it couldn't re-enter the way it was planned to. By re-entry, you mean happily being decimated by atmosphere not landing anymore. Exactly. So it's like a disposable vehicle. Yes, it's slated for re-entry disposal, destruction. Okay. So really, there's nothing more to be done with it. So that was the great thing about it. Good. That's an expensive piece of expandable fire infrastructure, but great. So how did you plan the research? What was the point of it? What were you interested in burning in that vehicle? Two types of questions we want to address. We want to learn about details about fire growth when you had a large practical-sized material. And is there – in 1G typically there's a T squared growth rate and things will just keep growing almost without bound until they get very, very large. And theory suggested that wouldn't grow continuously in low G. And so we wanted to look at that. And then we wanted to get an idea just the way people use FDS and other codes to model the impact of the fire on the structure and habitability on Earth. We were trying to use FDS and other codes to model the impact of the fire on the structure and habitability on Earth. We were trying to use FDS to model the impact of the fire on the spacecraft and really wanted to get some calibration points. So make sure that we weren't just going off the wrong direction. So we wanted, so we had two goals. One is to just have a fire, look how big it gets, how fast it grows. And two, at the same time, have a fire, look how big it gets, how fast it grows. And two, at the same time, have the fire impact the vehicle and see what it did to the vehicle. Pressure rise, temperature rise, et cetera. And also in this setting where there's a constant ventilation, right? So you would mimic the typical conditions in the space. Okay. Okay, good. And what types of materials were you burning? Because I assume it was not the fireproofed materials that you use normally in spacecraft. It was something specific. It was broken into two series. One was the first series where you really were very conservative, really did not impact the vehicle as much as would be helpful later. So that initial series, we looked at two very large, well, for us, very large, but some would say it's the size of a tea towel. But, you know, half a meter by a meter piece of fabric. It's a cotton fiberglass blend, so it won't rip and tear. It's a beautiful reference fabric. And we did two flights with that at different flow rates. And then the intervening flight, we had a variety of smaller samples, nine smaller samples of the same material plus PMMA and silicon rubber, which was an interesting flammability case, but trying to look at that. And those were all done in nearly sea level air. And then after that, we got approval to continue. We wanted to look at the higher risk atmospheres. And so we lowered the pressure in the spacecraft, working with the owner. After they separate from the space station, they vent out a bunch of gas. And then we backfill it with oxygen that we carry on board and try to bring it up to 36% oxygen. And then we were burning a mixture of samples ranging from, again, that same fabric and more PMMA samples, both simple ones and one with structural grooves and ridges, and Nomex, which is a fire-retardant material used for stowage and things in spacecraft. And so then, plus we had all kinds of other sensors throughout the vehicle. And so each flight we were trying to burn one very large sample that released as much heat as we could. And then we had temperature and CO2 sensors at six locations in the spacecraft and smoke sensors and a smoke recovery system at the other end. So outside of the validation data, were there any important lessons learned from that experiment? Interestingly, fires did achieve a very, spreading flames very quickly achieved a very steady spread rate. We also learned that the environment in which the fire is burning is more significant than we thought as far as affecting the spread rate. All previous experiments were done in relatively smaller ducts, which we thought were big enough. But due to the growth of the flame with respect to the volume, there was more flow acceleration in the other ducts than we anticipated. So they spread slower if they're in a big open environment than we had previously thought. if they're in a big open environment than we had previously thought. We saw some very interesting results validating previous experience with a material like black PMMA, a polymethylmethacrylate, which doesn't char and melts and pyrolyzes, and has, you get breakdown and paralysis in depth in the material, which causes bubbles and ejection. And it's the only thing we've seen in Skylab years ago when they're burning nylon. But basically, we turned off the flow, and it continued to burn for a very long time on its own, and supported by the heated ejecting gas from the in-depth in the material. So that was one surprise. And the other surprise, one big question is how long, if you've got a fire in a spacecraft, how long do you need to have the extinguishing agent around it before you can turn the flow back on and allow people to breathe? So we said, in that case, it needs to be off for quite some time for that kind of material. And likewise, on another flight, we had this really cotton, a knit cotton, like a T-shirt material. And that tended to curl and roll. And the charring, the embers persisted in the curled section quite a long time, and it did reignite it as well once the flow was turned back on. So there you can sort of have something like a deep-seated fire in low gravity, which we weren't sure of. So those are the big fire discoveries, I guess. So from just burning a cloth like a towel or very small samples of materials, it's really fascinating where you enter a place where no one has ever been before and you start to touch things that no one has ever thought of the scale before. And we always, like, I'm not surprised that the scale changed everything. That's the story of fire science and everything we do. Have you also done something with smoldering fires in that regard? I had Professor Rain on the podcast many times and he seemed to be concerned of smoldering persistent fires in Pace for example. He was a collaborator with Professor Fernandez-Peyo in Berkeley on a series of smoldering experiments we did and found that, I guess, overall, in-depth smolder was harder to support because in 1G, you have the buoyant flow pretty much will induce enough airflow within the sample. In low G, unless you really are pushing the air through it, it's harder to get oxygen depth in the sample. In low G, unless you really are pushing the air through it, it's harder to get oxygen and depth in the sample. But we do believe that there's a significant risk for a sample with an exposed surface for it to sort of lodge itself in the foam in depth and then transition to flaming later when the flow kicks on again. So I think that's an area that needs more study than it has gotten to date. I think that's one of the residual concerns. To me, long-term habitation, I'm worried about things like the trash. And we are also talking about long-term spaceflight. Yeah. Like, okay, ISS is a long-term spaceflight, very long-term spaceflight, but still if we think about exploring Mars or something, you don't have the comfort of having Soyuz aircraft that you can board and escape if something really disastrous happens. You've mentioned suppression. So let's go into engineering side of spacecraft. That also is fascinating. I have questions about detection, ventilation, suppression, evacuation. So let's try to touch a bit of everything because everything is different in space. So first of all, how do you detect fire in space? That's been a real challenge. The focus has been on smoke. So some aviation systems have thermal sensors, but there's really not a, the mass penalty gets to be too heavy to have too many of those. So that's not been done in spacecraft. And there's not a magic species, chemical species you can look for that for all materials will emit. So there's a lot of them emit CO, but not all of them enough. And so then there's CO2, but there's a lot of them emit CO, but not all of them enough, and so then there's CO2. But there's a high background of CO2 in a spacecraft because of the people respirating. So it leaves really back, every pyrolyzing material emits a lot of aerosols. So we're back to smoke and particles. The only problem is in 1G, as everybody knows, is this smoke rises, you get a beautiful smoke layer where you've concentrated smoke at the ceiling. In a spacecraft, again, there's no up, and you have a well-mixed, low-speed, turbulent flow. So you pretty much have to raise your whole spacecraft to the detection threshold for detect a fire because it's all mixed. And actually, at the same time, the life support system, the airflow, is taking smoke out of the system by the filtration. So it's very tricky. We don't have a better solution, I guess. So we're looking at smoke, and you really have to, each spacecraft, have a model individually based on the vague, unique things about its flow system. But you don't have a ceiling to put the smoke sensors on the ceiling, so where do you put smoke sensors? The universal answer is before the air intakes. So you have your whatever flow system, you know, it blows out in some areas and you suck it in other areas, they have filters right after that point. But if you put it in front of the filters, you can assure that it's sampling the vehicle pretty well. So it's somewhat like in the very early smoke detection systems where you have aspiration devices that would suck in probes of smoke. So here you use your vent system in a station to probe the air all the time because it's constantly being recirculated to the filters and everything. So you just take the opportunity that the whole air is sucked through that opening and you detect it. Okay, that's smart. And I guess flame detection makes no sense because if there's flame, that's kind of late, right? And probably don't want to have that anyway. Yeah, and it's a very cluttered environment, so it's getting line of sight to the source. No one's coming with a good answer. And, you know, the flame ones typically work on military vehicles where there's a big flame and there's a rather dramatic signal. So this is an example. Let's go suppression. Is there an extinguisher on the spacecraft that you grab and extinguish stuff? How does that work? It's varied over time. The shuttles era, the U.S. vehicles used Halon, the traditional CF-3BR. The Russian systems used a foam. And Apollo, they used basically a squirt gun from the water food hydration system. Then now on the space station, there's two choices on the U.S. segment. One is a CO2 extinguisher, and the other is now, more recently, they added a water mist fire extinguisher. We're not on anymore. I thought it would be brilliant because you're above the ozone layer, so you have nothing to destroy with it. The problem is, in a spacecraft, you can't get rid of whatever agent you release. You have to be able to live with. Okay. Halon's a problem because it does bad things to other parts of the life support system. Some of the air purification beds don't like halon. And so in the space shuttle era, if they used a halon extinguisher, they had to land immediately. So the space station, they just ruled it out. And then if you go to the future habitats, it's not going to work well anyway because of the enhanced oxygen concentration. Halons become flammable themselves. So that's not going to work. And CO2 is challenging because the extinguishing concentration is not a healthy concentration for people. And that's why in small volumes, it's not really a great choice. And it gets worse if you have a higher oxygen environment. So it's a good choice for if you've got a fire inside an electronics rack, You can deploy the CO2 in there, and you can raise that whole rack to half CO2 without having a problem for the crew. How do you apply it? Does it have, like, special inside distribution system in the racks? Because I assume it's not someone standing with a – I just imagine in my head someone running a normal extinguisher on the space station, and they would just immediately fly away from the fire source. So that's not a robust application. So the extinguishers have two choices. There's two nozzles. One is a diffuser nozzle for spraying on a fire in front of you, and the other is a probe that you stick into what's called a fire port. And all electronic systems that aren't sealed in a way to prevent a fire from propagating have to have a fire port. And you have to show that the fire port will, by two tests, get the gas to all the corners of your rack. Wow, that's rocket science. That's a specific fire port for extinguisher. That's interesting. And these things are operated by human, or there are parts where it would be automated? The space shuttle had certain sections of the critical avionics could be triggered with a fire extinguisher from the flight deck. But the space station, it's all crew extinguishment. So they looked at an automatic centralized system, but the mass penalty was too high. It's just everything you have to weigh, benefit versus how much you're going to launch. And since you're sending a lot of kilograms of very well-trained personnel there anyway, they can as well equip that part. Great, great, great. Next on my list, I have ventilation. That part. Great, great, great. Next on my list, I have ventilation. So you've said that some smoke will be filtered by the life support system. So the smallest fires, I guess, you can get away with. And at what point you would extract the smoke from the system? I don't know, seal a part of the station and just ventilate? Yeah, it's going to be a real time decision. There are certain sections of the station they could vent if needed, but generally that most of them you can't. And we're redesigning it with a call smoke eater. We call it, which is a filtration system, which would be designed for a fire scenario as opposed to the current life support filtration systems, which aren't really designed. Fire is not their main thing. But basically you have a series of aerosol filters, strip out all the aerosols, followed by a catalyst bed to convert the CO to CO2, and then a CO2 absorption material. Because you're designing for that anyway, for the breathing. And I guess space station is a little different because it's a complicated building in space pretty much, while vehicles would be different. So if we think about Artemis vehicles or something, you don't really have a possibility to ventilate, or you would have to have the crew wearing spacesuits pretty much all the time or be able to access them very quickly. Is that a thing? Is it possible to ventilate in such vehicles? Well, the vehicle is designed to be decompressible in the event that they have to do emergency extra vehicular activity. They can decompress the vehicle, open the hatch, and go outside and fix whatever needs to be dealt with. And the lander itself, of course, the door opens. But the electronics can function without air in them, so you can maintain your vehicle. Generally, depending on the mission, they have a certain amount of spare oxygen stores to manage both a necessary EVA, or if there's a leak scenario, they have a certain amount of spare oxygen stores to manage both a necessary EVA, or if there's a leak scenario, they have to be able to feed the leak until they can either fix it or pay a return. But that doesn't give you enough oxygen, typically, to carelessly. You probably can replace one volume of your chamber, your vehicle. You typically wouldn't do it all at once. You'd have to vent and fill. The lowest pressure you could tolerate, vent, venting, and backfill. So they typically want to manage the products also by filtration and replenishment. In all those vehicles, the crew could go on back in their suits and mask up and then breathe off the suit loop, which would also provide them clean air. So that's the other option. So it's really very vehicle-specific. You've got the NASA spacecraft, and you've got the commercial lander vehicle, plus you've got these commercial crew vehicles. And all of them have made different solutions for this question. But they all have to have some level, be able to tolerate a leak and manage it and return to Earth in time and have a scenario where they can provide alternate breathing until they can get the crew to safety. Last on my list is evacuation, but I already understand that they are not just victims of a fire. They are firefighters on their own as well. So I guess the procedure, to your best understanding, how would the procedures look? Would they first be informed and intervene and in case of overwhelm they would escape? Who takes the decision about evacuating? Is it the mission control or the commander in the space station? I guess it depends on the extent of the fire. And the crew has the ability to make the decision on their own on the space station. But typically, you wouldn't expect the fire to be slow enough where there'd be time to communicate. Their first priority is to get to their escape vehicle. And then there's assured return for everybody. There's a seat home for everybody. But they may not be near them. So hopefully they're not separated by the fire from their way home. So that's the first, because there isn't necessarily a properly fitted suit for them in the other vehicle. So there's a challenge to get to the right place. Once they're there, then they begin to address the fire. They put on their protective gear, grab an extinguisher, and proceed to cut power to the affected system, etc. But the first priority is to get them on the safe side of the fire. And then from then, again, the general practice is immediately to cut the flow in the affected module and particularly the affected rack or whatever system, and that will tend to dramatically weaken the fire and hopefully it will go out on its own. Then they proceed to use the extinguisher, as indicated. Okay. I have friends who are involved with Nexus Aurora projects. They design habitats, and I would get murdered if I don't ask you some stuff about potential future exploration. But habitats may be a far thing ahead, but we have Moon to Fly soon with Artemis program, so I think it's very relevant. So maybe let's try to discuss how does the challenge change when you go from Earth's gravity to, let's say, moon gravity? Are there any specific changes to that? Yeah, it's actually very, very challenging. I mean, first, as we mentioned, most of the near-term habitats will be a higher oxygen environment. That raises the vulnerability. Second of all, now you have buoyant flow, so you can't count on turning off the flow to turn off fires, and it will support fires in narrow channels, and you get back to the interesting flammability case where you have more enhanced interaction between two surfaces to support a fire. So things that will fail the NASA test in 1G with another piece of material nearby will burn. For example, wood is a classic thing. One piece of wood is very hard to ignite a continuing fire on, but two near each other, you can easily ignite it. So similarly in space, you're going to have similar effects and interactions, and you can have fires and narrow channels. And then on top of that, the detection is, I would describe as an unsolved problem as yet. We know there's buoyancy. That's going to push the smoke up to the ceiling, but less strongly than it does in one gene. And the lunar surface dust is very hazardous. It's very small particles. So it's in a submicron range, which is very bad for human respiration. That's like the size of smoke particles. Yeah, exactly. So there's a detection issue, but on top of it, it's just a very bad respiration issue. So they really want to get it out of the air. And they're taking steps, but it's going to come in on the surfaces of the suits, et cetera. They're going to have to mitigate it. So the likely scenario is you're going to have pretty aggressive ventilation downward to take advantage of the gravity to help push the particles to the floor where you'll suck them out. And so the question is, for a plausible lunar fire, will the smoke plume penetrate that downward flow or not? So we're still trying to model that to get a good understanding of the best approach for placing your detectors. for once i i feel like my earthly experience is somewhat relevant to the problem you've mentioned because uh in earthly buildings we often do hot smoke tests at the commissioning stage of the of the buildings and here we use a fairly small sized sources of fire, hundreds of kilowatts maximum to warm up the layers of smoke that we put into the building. Of course, it's a buoyant flow, but if we have any source of air that is like high velocity jets of air that mix with our smoke, what you get with is a smoke mixture, an aerosol mixture that is at the ambient temperature. So it loses its buoyancy. So suddenly it just moves, you know, more like an inertia flow. It's not even dispersion anymore. It's like with the inertia of the flow that it got trapped into. And you end up with this very persistent mixture of smoke everywhere that is extremely difficult to remove because you don't have a force that would move it to the place you would like it to be. So you either have to end up with very strong opposing flows that basically move everything to one side, but that probably will be difficult in a habitat where you don't have excessive air from outside. You can use to overventilate your space. So I see this could be potentially quite challenging to combat. We once filled the whole sports arena with smoke, and it took like three days to get rid of it. So, yeah, it may be a challenge. And good advice to friends on the moon, if you go outside, don't take a deep breath, because the dust is bad for your lungs. Exactly. And what about Mars exploration missions, long flights and the habitat on Mars? Do you see special challenges with that? Well, it's a different gravitational level, and we haven't really figured out which is the most – the highest flammability condition is believed to be somewhere in the lunar Martian range. We haven't really pinned down. Because of this competition between cooling and ventilation aspect of the flow, the maximum flammability is somewhere in that range. So we think Martian would tend to have stronger flames once ignited. So those are all going to be challenges. We don't really – we have not brought soil samples, regolith, it's called, back from Mars, so we don't know with certainty how small the particles are, but there was a lot of water on Mars at one point, so maybe they're not as small as they are on the moon, but this really isn't known. So one would expect that there's still a big dust problem on Mars, and so I think it's going to be similar to the moon, but with a difference in the flame intensity and the plume strength from a fire. And we were talking only manned exploration so far. And for unmanned missions like James Webb Space Telescope, is fire safety also something of a concern? Essentially not, because all those other spacecraft don't have an environment with oxygen in it. They can easily... Of course, yeah. They almost always design them to not have any atmosphere in it, and they use other systems to cool their electronics. But if you were going to have an atmosphere, you'd naturally make it nitrogen or something else, because there's no reason to have oxygen present. Seems that humankind and fires go hand by hand. Exactly. In space exploration, for sure. We breathe the same thing. We breathe the same. Essentially, it's a very similar process. It's just the timescale and chemical process are a little different. But, yep, it's very much the same thing. Chemical release of heat. David, one last thing I would like to ask you. A lot of people are listening. A lot of them are young fire engineers. Do you think one day something like a space fire engineer pathway will open? Maybe it's open already. It sounds like such an exciting thing. If I ask my younger self, would you like to be a space fire engineer? Oh, boy, sure. I wonder to what extent do you see this in a way a growing industry? Now we live in a different world than 50 years ago. We have private companies that regularly go to orbit. This is amazing. Who knows what will happen in 50 years? That's true. I think it's going to grow. I don't think it will ever rise to the point of terrestrial fire engineering. We currently have a great group of... Terrestrial fire engineering. I'm putting that on my business card now. Terrestrial fire engineering. We've got a great group of researchers with us at NASA and interact with excellent ones at some of the commercial providers, etc. So there's really... Glob but globally we're a small group, and there's also great fire researchers at the other space agencies. So there's really a tremendously group of researchers and engineers, albeit small. But I think this is a growing opportunity. There's clearly going to be more space flight in the future. So it is a future opportunity and a very fun one. more space flight in the future. So it is a future opportunity and a very fun one. I certainly have seen a fire engineer position for spaceport fire safety at SpaceX some time ago. So that's already close enough to me to touch this infrastructure. David, thank you so much for your time. This was an excellent conversation. And wow, such a different view on the fire science, fire problems, combustion fundamentals. It feels like rocket science now. That's right. It's been a huge fun opportunity for me as well. I really enjoy your podcast and I think I've got great information for lots of people on it. I wonder to how many people it will be relevant what we've talked today, but I think for everyone it will be interesting. So it definitely has been a big pleasure and for me a very special thing to talk with someone from NASA about my own job. That's amazing. Thank you so much for that. My pleasure. Thank you. And that's it. Wow. Thank you, David. That was a fantastic discussion and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And I'm especially thankful. You cannot know that, but we have to record this twice. The first time because of technical problems, I've lost the whole recording of David. So we had to actually meet once again and record the second time. I can say the second time was better. So in the end, you have a better product in your ears. I hope you may enjoy that a lot. From the things that I took from this episode, I took so many. Maybe I'll comment on a thing that we maybe touched more in the first recording session that was lost. And we didn't touch that much in the second one. The second one had so many more items on it, so we didn't cover that that much. But the role of ventilation in the spacecraft. And David mentioned that there's a constant velocity flow of 20 centimeters per second in the whole cabin. So there is a move around the station. And when the fire is detected, they stop it. So now, the consequence of stopping the ventilation in a spacecraft is completely different than stopping it on Earth. In terrestrial fire safety system, it would mean nothing. You just stop extracting. But in space, when you stop moving the air, the air doesn't really have weight to go into the flame. There's no way how the air would transport itself towards the flame. So you're essentially cutting out the oxygen supply to the flame. There's an interesting strategy there that stopping air movement makes the fire like quench itself because it has to expand to burn the air that's just standing around it. So let's say it's expanding in the form of a sphere. And because the further it goes from the fuel, the less of the heat feedback there is to the fuel surface, eventually it will radiate the energy away and stop producing new fuel and go out. A super interesting mechanism that would never work on Earth. And yeah, I would never think it could work like that. It's super, super interesting. And I hope you've found many of gold nuggets like this in the podcast episode. As mentioned before, there's a speak pipe feature on the website now. So just go into Ask Me Anything part of the website and just ask me a question if you want to hear more about spacecraft and fires and maybe some aspects of this that have not been touched on the air of the podcast. And for now, that's it. Thank you very much for listening to this episode and see you here next Wednesday. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
