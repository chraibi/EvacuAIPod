 Hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show episode 38. First, if you came here because someone referred this podcast episode to you as a good source of knowledge about wood in fire and the issues with hard to find elsewhere in such a convenient form. So, dear listener, if you're here because you're curious about the wood in fire, you're going to like it, I guess. Well, maybe not what we have to say, but you're going to enjoy the new knowledge that is being shared here by people who actually research timber in fire. being shared here by people who actually research timber in fire. And to all of my trusty listeners, welcome again to the Fire Science Show. It's going to be a fun episode again. I know timber in fire is one of the favorite topics on the podcast, and I'm going to bring more of that. And today I'm bringing you Dr. Daniel Brandon from RISE in Sweden, who is a researcher on timber in fire, on mass timber in tall buildings, who has done multiple large-scale fire experiments with exposed timber, and knows quite a bit about the difficulties related to this subject. And for this talk, I chose the theme to be fire resistance, because I'm very curious what's Daniel's opinion on fire resistance. But as you will hear, well, we ventured quite away from that in the episode into some of the very important things that matter when designing timber building in fire. So yeah, maybe the topic is not correctly picked, but I like it, so I left it like it is. And yeah, I hope you stay to the end. It's a great episode full of great insight. I hope you enjoy it. So yeah, let's go. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Hello everybody. I'm here today with Dr. Daniel Brandon from RISE in Sweden. Hi, Daniel. Great to have you here. Hi, good morning. Good to be here. We've met like in 2019, I think it was, and you were at this point receiving some NFPA awards. And I think it was also related to Timber in Fire, right? Yes, that was a project we did in collaboration with NFPA and NIST and NRC Canada, and we got an award for the project. That's so cool, because today I've invited you to talk about another aspect of timber in fire, which is a very popular theme in the podcast. And so far, I've talked with Danny Hopkin about the overall fire engineering of mass timber buildings and the implications of that, both the positive and the negative ones. I had Felix Weissner, who did talk in depth about the role of adhesives, the physics of moisture transport in wood, and some really, really interesting things about how wood behaves. And then I thought, in all of these talks, we often come to the concept of fire resistance. And I need to talk with someone about this concept in relation to fire. And I figured out you're going to be a great guest in that topic. So to set the theme of our talk today, we're going to be talking about the concept of fire resistance in timber buildings. Maybe you would like to introduce the listeners to what is the fire resistance? Because I have this feeling, you know, that fire engineers who work in laboratories or are researchers have a completely different comprehension of what fire resistance would be than an architect or a non-fire stakeholder, which is the root of the problem, in my opinion. Yes, there are many misconceptions about fire resistance testing, and I will get to the misconceptions later. But fire resistance testing is usually done on structural members. It could be walls, ceilings, floor slabs, columns, and beams. Then we have structural fire resistance testing and we have compartment dividing fire resistance testing and a combination thereof. So you can have fire resistance tests where you look at the ability of a wall to divide compartments to bear the loads in a building during a fire. the loads in a building during a fire. The problem is that we don't actually look at real fires in a fire resistance test. In a fire resistance test, we follow prescribed time temperature curve, and that is actually defined by the ISO 834 standard. So the thing is that it's not a fire, standard. So the thing is that it's not a fire, it's more like temperature, boundary condition imposed on the sample. And we know it, let's say, worked for a hundred years, more or less, even if we hate the concept and we know it's unphysical, but it somehow worked for the industry. So why coming back to it now, what is the difference when you put a timber frame or combustible wall inside? Well, if your specimen is combustible and it comes involved during the fire test, it actually adds to the heat energy inside the furnace so your combusting wood adds to the heat energy and the temperature however the temperature is controlled and that means that you somehow have to lower the energy input and the only way you can actually do that is by lowering your fuel input in the furnace and and that means that your burners will you have to reduce the burner efficiency in your furnace it is actually possible that your specimen contributes enough to completely shut down the burners and in those cases you can still control the temperature by increasing the ventilation through your furnace and reduce the temperature by reducing the ventilation through your furnace and reduce the temperature by reducing the ventilation through your furnace. I'll ask you a brutal question that I'm often being asked by people who disagree with me questioning this feature of furnaces. And I also feel uncomfortable turning off my furnace when I'm doing fire resistance tests. In that case, maybe we should call it the cooling fire test or something when we use the furnace to reduce the temperature rather than increase it. But I'm often being asked, so what? I mean, the sample burns, but the temperature is inside. So what? It doesn't change the temperature condition, but I feel that it's still wrong. What's your opinion? temperature condition, but I feel that it's still wrong. What's your opinion? It depends. Actually, this is a very difficult question, but it does depend. When people talk about these kinds of questions, they somehow refer to real building fires as well. So we actually have to look at both. In real building fires, the energy contribution of wood goes somewhere. I guess there are three options. The energy combusts inside the compartment and the energy combusts outside of the compartment or it doesn't combust at all. And I guess it is possible that it doesn't combust at all, but because then it's just combustible gases that eventually don't combust, but it's not actually very likely. So it's either combusting inside or outside. When it combusts inside, it actually increases the temperature. However, in a ventilation-controlled fire, the gases cannot combust inside. There is not enough oxygen. In that case, it combusts outside, and it might influence the fire exposure to your facade, outside and it might influence the fire exposure to your facade, but it doesn't increase the temperature inside the room, what it can do is actually extend the fire duration. So in most cases, the fire is influenced by the contribution of the wood, and that is not the case in fire resistance testing. However, the ventilation controlled condition in real buildings, the contribution of the wood has the least impact on the internal compartment fire conditions. Thank you. I'm just writing a rebuttal for a paper about fire testing of wood and this will be helpful. But for seriousness, I think you touch a very important thing that when we question the fire resistance, the discussion is magically moved towards fires in buildings. Whereas as long as we don't discuss timber in buildings, fire resistance is discussed, you know, as a testing protocol, not a real fire phenomenon. So I feel that there's some acrobatics happening, you know, when to justify an opinion, we suddenly start saying that fire resistance is a good representation of a building fire, where it's not, especially not a fire on its ventilation control, not a fire in a fairly small compartment that is ventilation controlled, which we know that may have much higher temperatures than the standard fire in the first 30, 60 minutes for sure. temperatures than the standard fire in the first 30-60 minutes for sure. And there's also this, you know, parametric fires and there's this magical gamma parameter which describes the ratios of openings, walls and everything. And there's a value of that, which is one where the fire is exact as the standard time temperature relation. And I must admit, in some fire experiments, I've seen configurations like that, and it truly did look like a standard fire. So I'm not saying that fires like that do not exist in reality. But I've seen so many where the peak would emerge so early in the fire and would be like in the range of 1,100 degrees, much more higher than the standard curve. Or the peak would arrive very late when we did traveling fire experiments, and the peak arrived after 30 minutes of very low temperatures. So you cannot put a parallel between the furnace and the real fires, and you cannot use real fires to defend the furnace when something is not right. I wanted to ask you, because I know you have been involved in a large mass timber project, fire safe implementation of mass timber in tall buildings carried in rice, and you've observed firsthand the behavior of large compartments with multiple surfaces of exposed timber. How did that fire dynamics look? Did you observe differences in the compartment fire dynamics when changing the amount of exposed wood? Because you had the same compartment over and over, right? Yeah, so we did do a number of tests actually. In total, I've been involved in 18 compartment fire tests. So not only that project, but the exposed wood does contribute to fires in several ways. And the project you talked about, most fires were ventilation controlled. In those fires, you don't actually increase the temperature inside the compartment. If the baseline test without exposed wood is already ventilation controlled, you can actually expose wood and the temperature doesn't increase. However, the duration of the fully developed phase did increase and also the external combustion did increase. Also, the external combustion did increase. In compartments with a larger opening, we actually saw that you can actually increase the temperature. In those cases, the fire is ventilation controlled, and it might extend the fire duration, but we haven't seen a significant extension of that fire duration for those compartments. a significant extension of that fire duration for those compartments. I guess the conclusion is the energy goes somewhere, but if it's a ventilation-controlled fire, it doesn't really go inside until the end of the fire when your fuel on the floor starts to burn out. Then it's still possible that your timber structures keep your fire fully developed for a while. So that would be the consequence in fire dynamics. Now, in terms of exposure, right, I have your plots, and you say that ventilation control doesn't increase when you expose wood, but you are already touching like 1,200 degrees Celsius. So, I mean, there is not much more space to increase from that because you're almost at the flame temperature with your upper smoke layer. So there already has been, I mean, in standard fire, this temperature would be reached, I don't know, at six hours or something. So after 30 minutes, you have 800 something degrees. After one hour, you have 930. So that's quite a vast difference and in real fire you can expect temperatures well above a thousand and in a test you subject your specimen temperatures around 800 900 ish celsius and we need to remember that radiation is in the fourth power of of temperature so the differences between these two values in terms of the heat flux are insanely high. Yes, that is a very high difference. I mean, 100 degrees between 900 and 1000 is a really, really big difference. So now in your compartment fire experiment, you have completely different exposure of the surface of the wood than you would have in a furnace. And in a furnace, we know that we sometimes, maybe not us, maybe it's the customers or the clients, but you design a sample to pass the test. You don't design a sample to be the best sample in the world of samples. You design a sample to be the best sample in the world of samples you design a sample to pass the test and in terms of of pacifier protection you would choose how many protection boards or what's the depth of the intermescent paint or how much wool you need to put on it to just pass the test in terms of wood this engineering is often done in terms of charring. Like you would have this depth of char in your test specimen, which will make it okay at this exposure. But then you go into real compartment and it changes completely. Did you observe quicker char formation or stronger char falloff in these experiments compared to what would you see in resistance tests? Yes. Yeah, definitely. The charring rates are much, they can be much higher in a real compartment test than we speak of. Without delamination, you can have one millimeter per minute quite easily. With delamination, temporarily, it goes really much beyond that. It goes to millimeters per minute for a while and then it quickly lowers. Yes, I think one thing that is important to mention is that effects of delamination in a compartment fire are much more significant than effects of delamination in a furnace test. So in a furnace test, we might have some additional charring. And eventually, to meet the criterion, to meet the requirements, you might need an additional amount of material. So you can say you need a certain percentage of extra material to get a fire resistance of two hours. But in reality, if you allow the lamination in a real compartment fire, it actually can have very significant consequences. It actually can mean the difference between a building withstanding a full natural fire or actually a building collapsing eventually during the fire. And then we don't talk about a certain percentage of additional material. You just talk about a very significant difference of consequences of the fire. In ITB, we did, let's say, a funny experiment. We've built walls with OSB sheets on timber substructure, a very simple wall that was calculated to withstand something like 30 minutes of standard fire exposure. And we've went into, okay, so if we want the furnace to have this standard temperature relation in it, let's find how much heat the furnace does need to actually heat itself up to this standard temperature. So we've closed the furnace with a wall that's built from the same material as the furnace, so there was no sample, it was just a furnace. And we've run a 30-minute fire resistance test on the furnace itself. And we've captured this, we called it the baseline heat release rate, like we've captured how much heat does the furnace need to heat itself up. Then we've placed the OSV wall. We've done a standard fire resistance test. It didn't go well because we couldn't control the temperatures. We maybe have used too small furnace for that. But the temperatures were already like 100 degrees above the standard curve and we could have not do anything more about it. It was very hard to control. And then we did the same test, repeated it, but we've imposed the condition on the furnace that, okay, you can lower the heat release rate, but you can never go below this baseline curve that we determined that you need to heat itself. And the idea was that wood is a very good insulator. So we will impose at least this amount of heat that you would need to heat up an insulator to the standard time-temperature relation. And whatever wood contributes from itself, it's contributed and it will just raise the temperature. And here we got like 200, 300 degrees above standard curve. The test duration has decreased from 28 minutes to 23 minutes, if I recall correctly. So the difference was quite striking. It was so much quicker to destroy the sample. And then we did the third test in which we have done the same as in the second one, but we've over-ventilated the furnace. So we said, okay, now you have the baseline heat, you can combust, and you have all the oxygen in the world you want for combustion, so burn as much as you want. And we actually lost some thermocouples. It was insane, the fire in the furnace, and the sample got destroyed in like 16 or 17 minutes, half of the time than it took to destroy the same sample in the standard test. And of course, it was just an OSB wall, nothing fancy, nothing really designed. It was not structural timber, nothing really like, it was a sample, that's it. We didn't have any agenda behind it to show that osv walls can be great we just wanted to test the conception that idea that if you impose like a baseline it's released and the test goes quite different and the funny aspect is if we have put the same condition like there is the minimum heat release rate into any other test like any other non-combustible test, it would not do anything because the tests were already above that threshold because of the furnace action and the heat transfer to the sample, and the sample not contributing to the furnace. So it only affected this sample in the furnace. So I found it really astounding that when you change this little in the test, and we did add literally 200, 300 kilowatts to the furnace, it was not a huge amount of heat that we add, and you suddenly cut the fire resistance period by 30%, by 50%. That's astounding. And now in your ventilation controlled room, we know that there is damage going in the compartment. You may lose doors, you may lose windows, you may have cracks in the wall that suddenly give some oxygen near the sample, and then it will contribute. So it will be somewhere between our experiment two and three. So I wondered if you ever tried something like that. Yeah, that is a very difficult question that I don't have the answer to, but I think it's good to discuss the problems that we face. In a furnace, it's designed to maintain the heat. We have very insulative walls, small ventilation, very little ventilation usually. And if we add the contribution of wood, yes, it will be very significant, and it will be more significant than in most building fires. In a building compartment we have heat losses through walls but it will be likely more than the heat losses through a furnace wall. We have usually much more ventilation especially in case of flashover fires. If we add the energy of wood in a compartment fire condition, it will have a different effect than the energy of wood in a furnace condition. It's, however, very interesting. It's a good attempt to include the contribution of wood. However, there doesn't seem to be a very easy way to do that in a way that is relevant. So another method that includes the contribution of wood in addition to the fuel is radiant panel testing. At the University of Edinburgh, they developed the H-TRIS test, where a radiant panel moves towards a specimen. Actually, those were the first fire tests I've ever conducted at the University of Edinburgh. And what it does is it imposes a radiation to a specimen, and the specimen combusts and leads to flames as well, and those flames radiate to the specimen as well. So there you can say you actually separated the heat source and the fuel contribution, and both are included in the test. And this test can be relevant in some scenarios. However, this test is actually done in room conditions and you have a lot of oxygen available. And that is sometimes the case in a building, but actually only rarely. But most of the times when you have a flash over fire, you do have a low oxygen concentration close to your timber surface. And what we found is that this H-TRIS test, I guess it's useful for some scenarios, but not to present a fully developed fire or a flash over fire where oxygen concentrations are low. flash over fire where oxygen concentrations are low. One issue that timber has in high oxygen concentrations is that the char that comes to exist starts to oxidize and that results in additional energy. In low oxygen concentration environments, this char doesn't oxidize. At least it can reach very high temperatures of around 1200 degrees without oxidizing. And therefore it doesn't lead to this additional energy, but it also maintains the char layer, which is also an insulative layer. It's really nice that you've already made the parallel between the furnace and the environment, that in fact in a furnace the addition of the timber combustion will be more severe, In fact, in a furnace, the addition of the timber combustion will be more severe because of how the furnace is constructed versus how the compartment is constructed. And we need to keep that in mind. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. That's a very important thought. And obviously, there is no simple answer. We did it as a literally exploratory experiment because we just wanted to see what happens. You know, we are, and I guess you share the same passion for fire. There is only one way to find out what happens. It's by setting it on fire. And I think, and H2S is also an interesting approach, but I think we somehow need to fit the timber in the furnace because of the paradigm of the industry. You know, fire resistance is so prevalent in the industry that if you want to have an effect on how buildings are built, you need to go back to fire resistance. The architect will not care about whether wood oxidizes or not. They will care if it's 60 minutes or 2 hours because that's what the code tells them to put in this barrier. And I think the battle may be already lost. Like we will not be able to change the paradigm at least not easily. Like we will not be able to tell. From today we're not working with fire resistance periods because it would be too difficult for the other stakeholders to comprehend. So we need somehow to find a way to give a number on the timber structure that is maybe a little more realistic, but would be comparable with everything else. And I have no idea how to do that. That's a hell of a problem. Yeah, I do have an answer, I guess. I've got an opinion. The problem is that we work in prescriptive regulations, we work in classifications, and this system has been used for classification for a long time, for more than 100 years. And in order to use that in a useful way, that is actually the challenge. And whether we can use it is actually dependent on what you want to achieve with it. If you ignore timber, the combustibility of timber, if we look at concrete structures, in the past, fire resistance testing has been, to some extent, useful to prevent collapses in buildings. You can say, okay, the exposure is not very realistic, but you can say if your fire resistance requirements is high enough, let's say we take a fire resistance of six hours in a high fuel load and such a severe condition that is actually in reality very unlikely so for timber and that actually changes a bit because there is a scenario where your timber just continuous to contribute to the fire you can say if there is a contribution to the fire of your timber structure doesn't stop until it's fully consumed, then you have a problem because then you don't have a timber structure anymore, you will have a collapse. And that's one difference as if the assignment is the goal is to prevent collapse in any natural fire without relying on something or someone extinguishing the fire, then you need more than fire resistance. You would need a whole set of prescriptive regulations. You need a limitation of how much timber you can expose. You need requirements regarding material behavior. For example, if your CLT is allowed to delaminate, it becomes really difficult to actually guarantee that the fire will extinguish at some point. So you need to prevent those things. You need to prevent gypsum fall-off, which has pretty much the same effect. If your gypsum board protection falls off from your timber wall, then it actually will suddenly start to contribute to the fire if the fire is hot enough. You also should probably prevent a significant contribution of protected wood. So even if it's still protected, but it's charring, it still contributes to the fire. And unfortunately, this heat produced can be trapped, partially trapped between the gypsum and the wood, and it might actually make extinguishment completely impossible. But those sets of regulations, plus potentially more, you need to prevent collapse in real buildings. So you would need a whole set of prescriptive regulations to do it. So you would need a whole set of prescriptive regulations to do it. Or you go to a performance-based approach where you need to show that your fire actually decays at some point, which is also challenging because there needs to be methods to do that. That's a really good one. That was a really good one. If you test your, let's say, concrete wall and it gives you two hours fire rating, when you put the two-hour wall into the building, I will now make a horrible mistake, but it's allowed. You could say that, okay, it can take two hours of a fire and go down, or if the fire is shorter, it will just survive and be there. In reality, it's more complex than that because of how heat transfer works and how natural fires develop. But in essence, you would have just this wall can stand for two hours and that's it. Then you turn off the fire, the wall still stands. In terms of combustible structure component, your two hours pass, you say, okay, the fire is gone. And now we have to put out the construction because it's still burning and still contributing. So there's a paradigm shifting difference, you know, that in the previous world where we didn't really have that much exposed combustible structural elements, you've passed your test duration and you're done with the test. It has passed high five and let's sell it. and you're done with the test. It has passed high five, and let's sell it. In here, you pass the two-hour test, and you are left with the problem of the structure contributing now, not just the fire that has gone off or has burned out completely, but you have still a contributing source of a fuel that you would not have before if it was incombustible. I'm now in a two-story building, build of food, and I'm very comfortable in it. And I love it. And I can imagine why people would like to have in the city center the same feel of the warmth and beauty as I have in here. But when you have a 30-floor skyscraper, it is a challenge to, you know, put that structure off on the 30th floor compared to what you can do from the ground level to apply water, to do an external action to actually stop this contribution. So I guess that's the most challenging aspect of tall timber in fire. Not the fact it has insufficient fire resistance, not the fact that it will generate char layer quick enough or not. Will it laminate or not? I mean, these are technical issues, but the true issue is like if the structure is a part of the fire after the fire has ended, what do we do with it? And that's the biggest challenge, right? Yes, I agree with that. I think that that part of the research challenges hasn't been focused. The focus wasn't on that for a long time. And I guess it is for a reason. Like 20 years ago, it was very unlikely to build higher than four stories, actually, in timber. Now the world is changing and people are really pushing to build higher with timber structures. It becomes a much more important question. Something that you may reasonably assume in a three or four story building is that at some point someone will either extinguish the fire or it is somehow acceptable that the building could collapse. And that becomes increasingly less reasonable if you build taller and taller. And I don't think there are many people who would say, yeah, but it's a 30-story building. Everyone left, so it can collapse. That's actually quite unreasonable. It will damage many things. It will cost a lot. It will be a risk to neighboring buildings, but it will damage the whole industry. So they shouldn't allow such a building to collapse. It's also very unreasonable to rely on the fire brigade extinguishing a fire on the 30th floor or 20th floor. And it's actually also not good to rely on sprinklers only because also sprinklers have a limited reliability. In case the sprinklers don't work, then you still should be sure that the building doesn't collapse. Even though they have fairly high reliability, I guess from 85% to maybe 95%. Actually, I'm supposed to do a podcast episode on that. That's going to be a good one. But it's, you know, sort of Russian roulette with fire. If your sprinklers work, you're fine. If they don't, you lose your building. And even if it's like 5% chance that you lose your building, is it acceptable that you have 5% chance of one in a 50-year event that you lose your building? No, I think it needs to be in balance. So if you say you rely on sprinklers to extinguish the fire, well, if it's in one in 10 of the cases that the sprinkler doesn't work, the damage shouldn't be much more than 10 times as high. Then you basically reduce, on a big societal level, you reduce safety by reasoning like this. It's also, you know, the fact that in many types of structures, you would receive completely different fire outcomes depending on your location, which means, for example, you have open plan compartment. If you have the fire at the facade, you could maybe expect a larger damage to the facade in the first 60 minutes. If you have it closer to the core of the building, you may have the damage to the core of the building. But if you have it in the bathroom, you're okay. If you have it in your sleeping room, that's probably worse. If you have it in the kitchen, it's a different... Like every of this fire leads to a completely different set of outcomes, and each of them has their own probabilities. While if you imagine a building with all surfaces of exposed combustible material, wherever the fire happens, it will eventually lead to the structure being involved and that can lead to pretty much the same set of outcomes. You either put it out or it will destroy the building, right? I could imagine that the location or the size or the triggering event stops having this huge impact on the outcomes of the fires, where in normal building you, that would be a factor. Like you may have small fire, you may have large fire, you may have a flashover fire, you may have a local fire of a trash bin. They all have a different set of outcomes, but here each of them can lead to ignition of the structural elements. And once they burn, they will not just magically go out themselves. They will contribute until it's been stopped and it all leads to the same level of damage. That's really frightening to me because we lose this margin of safety from the uncertainty of the fire size we usually have. Yes. So I think in many countries the fire development part is regulated using reaction to fire classifications. At least in Europe, that is the case. Yes, and it can be in some cases ignored. I know in a country like Sweden, you can install sprinklers in a building where it isn't required. And then you can exchange it for another requirement, such as the reaction to fire class. And that is actually something that may not be very reasonable to do. I think these considerations are the things that are being missed by the society a lot. Like when we only focus on this one parameter, which is fire resistance, which we already discussed is partially flawed in terms of timber structures. You cannot just focus on that. There's so much more into that. And maybe these things that we omit into account the growth of the fire, the compartment fire dynamics, and how the wood will impose the management of this additional energy, which will go somewhere. If I saw that and someone said, okay, and my walls will be 60 minutes, I have nothing about the walls. I mean, they, okay, let them be 60 minutes. If you manage all the other threats, that's, that's beautiful. That's the case is solved. You did your fire engineering because the problem was not in the fire resistance. It was the other things. It's just, it's so hard to convince the society to think about the other things that I feel we need to do something with the fire resistance to already include some of these effects in it. That's my personal opinion. Okay, so to go on with the effects of the fires. You've mentioned extinguishing, and we sometimes talk about self- extinguishment of wood, and that's a challenging thing. I would love to hear your personal opinion as a fire engineer who researches wood. When would you say it has self-extinguished? Is it when the flaming action stopped? Is it when the smoldering stopped? Is it when it burned out completely and disappeared? Well, I actually try not to use the word self-extinguishment. Oh, sorry. But I usually refer to continuous decay. Well, and some people refer to extinction of flames. I think that is just not enough because that can occur at a very high heat fluxes and it could correspond to around 600 degrees platemometer temperature which is still very high and you still get structural damage and still get charring and smoldering extinction of smoldering is better but it's actually an impossible task to design a building for extinction of smoldering. I guess it may work, but you might just have the users of the buildings installing some piece of equipment using screws and a hole in the timber. And it might just keep smoldering there. Or you might have a piece of furniture that is close to a wall like i've got in my my house a tree trunk table it's very thick it will burn for a very long time if it is placed next to a wall which is the case and the wall would be exposed i guess there will be an interaction between this table and the wall for a very long time. And the smoldering wouldn't stop. Actually, it wouldn't stop until one of the two, the wall or the table, is gone. And I guess it would likely not stop. I don't know if you saw the recent paper by Sereb and Arup with Imperial College. Yes. I think it's called, I think. And in that paper, they have this example of smoldering above a beam, where after like 40-something hours after the flame extinguished, there's no more flaming, but the smoldering is ongoing above a beam. And eventually, after two days, have burned a hole above the beam, like all the way through the ceiling. And we also saw something similar in our experiments where we had a beam and CLT slab above it. And above the beam, you know, there was this funny configuration of surfaces which re-radiated on each other and just sustained this smoldering action on and on and on. And it went really, really deep. So I would assume that if we have not extinguished it with water, it would just go on and continue. So eventually you're led with the problem that you need intervention. Like you assume that there must be intervention. Otherwise, this will continue until all the fuel is consumed in the region where this phenomenon happens. Yes, I think that's right. You need at least someone to check whether there's smoldering and extinguish that smoldering. So that's sort of what we tried to incorporate in our last project. So after the test, we used thermal cameras. We had the fire brigade checking, but they actually need to check for a while. You cannot just check after the fire and leave. You need to stay there. And we don't know how long, but we saw after half an hour, you can actually, in our case, you could see some hotter locations. There they extinguished smoldering. Was it in some specific points, like, I don't know, joints of the structure? You mentioned studs and... It was, yes connections that most connections didn't need it but if the sealant wasn't correctly applied then yes and it continues and we also saw where we had lamellas that didn't fall off but they stuck to the wall or the ceiling, that behind the lamellas, between the CLT and the lamella, it continues. However, I think that is a location where eventually it might die out by itself. But the connections, that probably continues until it burns through at some point. And I know they experienced it in a set of German tests that also the next day there was a hole. But I believe that in that test it did lead to a hole in the floor, I believe, but it didn't need extinguishment afterwards. It just burned through and then it stopped. However, I guess it's it's hard to tell what the consequences can be oh that's interesting because in our experiments we usually build a insulated compartment you know that is not a part of a building structure or a building frame and here if the damage is to the joints or into some let let's say, fragile connections, it will be very hard to fix that afterwards, the fire. In general, I assume fixing a timber-framed building after a fire could be quite challenging to replace a slab in a building that's standing. Was this a part of any considerations of your group fixing after the fire? Yeah, so that is a very new area. So we repaired a part of the ceiling after our very last compartment fire test, and that was a CLT ceiling. And that was relatively successful. I guess you got the bending capacity back and the flexural stiffness. It is more difficult if you have cavities and also timber frame will be more difficult. However, I know one example in Sweden. I don't think they published a report yet, but where there was a real building fire, this building was built of modules. So parts of the compartments were made in the factory and then assembled on site. But they disassembled the modules, brought them back to the factory, and then repaired the modules separately and brought it back. And in that case, at least what I've heard, not officially through the report, is that the costs were reduced very significantly to 10% of the original building costs. While in previous cases, it actually did occur that the whole building had to be demolished and rebuilt. All of this is really interesting, and I love how we opened with fire resistance and finished with all these important aspects of what you can consider beyond the fire resistance. Maybe I've put a wrong question into the title of this episode about fire resistance. Maybe it should be all about the consequences. But I think it's necessary for people to hear how the discussion can be separated between the fire resistance and the consequences of the fire. And if more people did separate these things from each other, the least problems we would have and the least stupid articles on LinkedIn would be published every week. And I would truly love that world. And I will link the resources that we've discussed in this talk, and I will link the project on mass timber in tall buildings. There's a YouTube channel with all the experiments. You can see what Daniel meant by additional fire energy going somewhere. If you open them side by side to experiments, I would recommend experiment three. I like that one. It seemed interesting. I think it's the one that you had the corners exposed. From your perspective as a scientist, did it make such a difference to expose a corner of the experiment? Something that we don't know much about and I'm trying to perform more research on is the interaction between exposed walls. And if you want the fire to decay, at some point this interaction should be insignificant to allow a fire to cool down. If you have two timber slabs that are very closely spaced with a high fuel factor to each other, they might burn forever until one of them is completely burned out. And the same happens a bit in corners. You have interaction between the walls. And we think it is an equation of many things, but one of them is the oxygen content. And that's why we think we saw the effect mostly in the bottom of the compartment and another part of the equation is the material behavior itself so if it behaves like a rock solid timber member or whether it lets go a little bit of the I guess the bond line opens up a little bit that makes a probably makes a quite a big difference in those corners i think in sweden you are masters of re-radiating structures there is this famous camping technique called at least we refer to it as the swedish fire log where you cut a log of the timber like with a chainsaw in like four you make four cuts or six cuts in the in. You put something inside to ignite it, and then all the walls burn each other, and you can cook on it. You can cook it. That's the Swedish fire log. It's the same phenomenon, but used for the benefit of having a delicious meal in your camp, not burning a building. Yes, that's right. That's really good. Swedish used it for ages. Now they use it's right. That's really good. Swedish used it for ages. Now they use it in buildings. That's frightening. One last question. Where are you going now with the team research? Or you're dropping the field and you're going to do batteries like everyone else? I know. I think there are actually many questions that still need answering. So I guess the smoldering aspect in the end is interesting. I know it's challenging, but well, we can improve, definitely. There is rehabilitation after a fire. What I think is very interesting after the test at SARE in collaboration with ARAB is how to actually allow large compartments or if he can allow it and how to limit fire spread in such compartment. I've been in the in the experiment one the one we did with Imperial in Poland where we used non-combustible structure with the same fire load and I remember how huge and frightening that fire was and then Guillermo told me that the the serif fire was like twice bigger and i i really cannot comprehend how big the fire must have been and it it really is scary and especially the aspect that in that paper that that they show the the spreads through the ceiling which for me it was surprising how quick the fire accelerated through the compartment. And I'm also doing a lot of experiments with OFR on CLT for Structural Timber Alliance, Special Interest Group CLT. And we did burn compartments that were seven meters long. We've seen this propagation. It was really fascinating. Now we are doing small compartments with different parts of it exposed or encapsulated with the differing amount, like a parametric study on encapsulation, which is really, really interesting. we're eventually reaching a point where we have really overwhelming amount of experimental contribution to propose some general ideas on the timber compartment fires, you know. In three or four years, when every of this is finished, all of this is published, we will have small compartments with small openings. We will have small compartment with huge openings. We have your compartments, which were medium-sized and had different opening factors. We have our experiments with OFR where the opening factor was irrelevant. Like, the opening was on the far, far side of ventilated regime. We have a CLT compartment that fires 300 square, 270 square meters from France, where they also play with. Like we are reaching this point. Maybe you remember Cardington Papers, where they had this chart of different opening factors and sizes of compartments. And from that, they were able to produce some generalized theory for steel frame buildings. Maybe we will be able to reach something like that in mass timber soon-ish, in like five years. And that would be amazing. Yes, I think that's possible as long as the goal is clear, what is acceptable and what isn't. And that is probably the biggest challenge to agree on that. Then it becomes different for different occupancies of a building, but also the height of a building. So I guess most people would agree a two-story house doesn't need a lot of requirements. And they do agree that very tall buildings need much more requirements, but everything in between, it's just a matter of opinion. but everything in between, it's just a matter of opinion. So I guess if there is some kind of system in that, then you can say, okay, to achieve that, either this set of requirements, and it shouldn't be only fire resistance, it should be some specification of how much wood can be exposed, if at all, at a certain height, what the material behavior should be, and everything that is protected, how much protection there should be on those members. Also, the reaction to fire classification should be specified. Actually, it needs a whole framework, but at least in Europe, and I guess also among other other countries there is not really a good agreement between what is needed at which building height and what is needed for different occupancies you're leaving me here with very uncomfortable thoughts please say something positive can we build safely with timber well i i didn't want to indicate that you cannot build safely with timber. I just stated that using fire assistance alone doesn't always give you a sufficient level of safety, especially in buildings where a collapse would lead to very high consequences and also buildings where you cannot rely on someone or something extinguishing your fire. If that is the case, if you actually cannot rely on these things, you can have a good set of prescriptive regulations that would, next to just requiring a fire resistance, would also require or give limitations of how much you can have visible and related to the potential consequences of fire in such a building. But also the configuration of what can be exposed and what can be visible, how far can they be apart, what could be the few factor between them. And for the protected surfaces, there needs to be a requirement of how much protection those surfaces need. If it's gypsum boards, how much gypsum boards would they need? In Europe, you have the K-classes, and they should be used, but then based on research of fires that actually aims for decaying fires. But if you don't have that, there are only a few countries that actually have adjusted to recent research, and research has led to improvements it's not only research at rise we also talked about the ofr tests and the whole fire safety engineering community actually has worked a big part of the fire safety engineering community has worked to improve the performance of such buildings. But if the national regulations didn't adjust to that yet, then it usually comes down to just safe engineering. You need a very competent engineer, especially if you need performance-based design. You need a competent engineer, but even a competent engineer would need validated methods. And those, we're still working on them there are a few methods but all all methods have their own limitations and i think there need to be more in the future okay that that's that's much more positive i i like that so there is a way out to build safely with timber maybe not with the fire resistance as the ultimate proxy of fire safety on its own, but considering all the circumstances, basing on peer-reviewed science, and having competencies in place, that's the element. You need fire resistance is not enough, but we can make it work, right? Yes, I think so. That's good. I can leave you now. On this point, we can make it work, right? Yes, I think so. That's good. I can leave you now. On this point, we can finish up. I like a positive ending with a way out, and especially one that emphasizes on why we need fire safety engineers and why we need competent ones in the field. Thank you so much, Daniel. Yes, thank you. It was a great pleasure to have you on the show and see you around. Yes, it was an honor. Thank you. Thank you very much. It starts to be slightly boring whenever I get an expert on wooden fire. It usually ends up the same way. We need fire safety engineers. We need competencies. We need holistic view on compartment fires. We need to look beyond fire resistance. We need to include all the effects this will have on building fire. And as Daniel said, the energy will go somewhere, so we need someone who can consider that. Why those experts cannot just say that wood is stronger than steel in fire, or that the charlayer will prevent anything, and you can safely build to a thousand meters with wood. They seem to be unconvinced. Obviously, I'm sarcastic as usual. But as you see from this episode, from episode with Danny, from episode with Felix, it is a complex issue. It is an issue so complicated. There is absolutely no way you can frame this problem into a fire resistance problem. It never was a fire resistance problem to start with. It's just one measure, one out of many, that we can and we should use when designing timber buildings. And what Daniel said about configurations, the arrangement of materials, the view factors, how much you encapsulate, how much you expose, this is happening right now. We are researching that. There's many groups researching that. Already now, you could probably use the knowledge we have and apply it and design quite a robust timber structure that will be safe. And in a few years, you will be armed with excellent research, with excellent peer-reviewed research on this subject that will allow you to design safely. I'm just really worried that no matter how much research we do, no matter how much we publish, no matter how much insight we gain, it will be difficult to beat the fire resistance paradigm and show to the world that it's just a measure. I hope you will help me on that mission by sharing this episode and having informed discussions with your colleagues about this issue. And I hope all three episodes on Wood and Fire have brought you some really good insight into how it can really work and where the issue is. That's my dream that I did army with this and I hope I've achieved that. So thank you very much for being here with me and some housekeeping items. First, I'm very thankful to all the supporters to the podcast who donate to the show through my website. I really appreciate that. Every dime you send goes to equipment and software and licenses and servers. And so by participating in this, you help me a lot. And I would also like to ask you to go to your podcast app that you're using wherever you're listening and maybe pop a five-star review there, which helps me with algorithms and stuff so the podcast is more easily available or more easy to find for ones that don't know about its existence but may need it at some point. So thank you for all of this and see you next Wednesday. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
