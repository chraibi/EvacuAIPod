 Hello and welcome to episode 54 of the Fire Science Show. Great to have you here. In the first year of our Fire Science Show, we've opened up with an interview with a famous professor, Professor Guillaume Ruin. And for a good start for the second year, I also have a quite famous professor here today, and I'm really thrilled to host him on the show. His name is Arnold Dix. He's from Australia, and he specializes in tunnels. In fact, he's the president-elect of International Tunneling Association and just received an NFPA award for committee service on his input to NFPAs 502 and 130, which are critical for tunnel engineering. So he certainly knows a thing or two about tunnels. I've met him for the first time like 10 years ago in Sweden on a metro seminar where he gave a really interesting speech at the conference dinner about his journey. I actually thought he's a stand-upper who was just invited because that talk was absolutely hilarious and I loved it. And now I've rediscovered him 10 years later, just a few months ago in Graz conference in Austria, where he gave a really passionate talk about fire engineers learning the wording of sustainability words. How to talk the talk, as he said, how to communicate with sustainability goals in mind and how these goals can actually change the perception of your own work and the tunneling projects we're involved with. And a particular topic was the one that I've invited him into the show with, but as you will hear, we went far beyond that, and it was a really, really great adventure. He asked me before the interview, what are we going to talk about? And I told him we will start with sustainability sustainability and no one knows where we will end. And that's actually what happened, but it ended up really well. I actually ended. It's not an end because I have invited him for part two, which you will hear the next week, where we will talk about more and more interesting aspects of tunnel engineering, modern technologies, and the role of fire science and all of that. I hope you will love it. I loved it absolutely every single minute of this discussion. It's such a great speaker and such a cheerful person. I absolutely adore him. And I hope you will hear that through the podcast that the energy is great and we're having great time discussing important matters in fire safety. So I guess I got your attention right now, and I hope you'll stay till the end of the episode and tune in for the next week where we will hear part two. Let's spin the intro and let's go. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I will be your host. Hello everybody. Welcome to the second year of the podcast, and we're opening it with a great guest. I have today Professor Arnold Dix, the President-Elect of International Tunnel Association. Hey, Arnold. Great to have you on the podcast. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I'm very happy. Always happy to have great guests. And from a small sample in a conference a few weeks ago, it's going to be a good talk. Oh, I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited as well. So I've snapped you at the Grads event and you gave a really good talk about new ways of communicating with everyone around, non-engineers especially, in relation to sustainability and our need to change the way we communicate in order to keep our jobs and still be able to do what we're doing. The world is changing, so we need to adapt. But before we go into how to speak the speak or talk the talk, like you said, let's settle up how sustainable tunnels are. You really think that tunnels are a great part of sustainability of the new world? What a loaded question to get off. Straight up. Punch me straight in the nose. Straight up. Double barrel. Yeah, double barrel to the head. You have asked the absolute clangor of a question for us right here at this stage in human history because traditionally you'd have to say our tunnels have been instrumental in delivering water, sanitation, power, all the transport, all the great things for our civilisation. However, right now I think there are some big questions about the value proposition of underground infrastructure moving forward from a sustainability point of view and from a carbon footprint point of view and from a climate crisis point of view. I made that presentation in Graz saying, my friends, we need to understand this narrative right now in order to not only communicate the sustainability of the underground and what it delivers for humanity and the planet, but to double check that we're right. Actually, to double check, I think it's time to pause and have a look and go, Actually, to double check, I think it's time to pause and have a look and go, are these assets that we've created really as wonderful as we think they are in terms of the current pressing climate emergency sustainability agenda, what have you? I think the answer is yes. Like, I do think they are. And I think they're overwhelmingly yes because they're intergenerational. So whereas buying a new car or making a choice over some consumer item or even building a road or building a house or something like that, you've really got to ask yourself some hard questions. I think with our underground infrastructure, because it lasts and it lasts for hundreds or maybe even thousands of years, that really tips it into the, yes, this really is transformational kind of stuff. Let's do it right. And generation upon generation of human beings and the planet itself can take advantage of it. But to answer it like that, we've really got to stop, pause, look in the mirror and go, what's the story on the carbon? What's the story? What's the story with the cement? What's the story with the method for construction? What's going to happen to that carbon? Is it actually encapsulated? Is it going to be leached? All know, all of that devil in the detail, that's what we need to really get our head around right now to answer this robustly. We have some landmark projects that literally change the way how communities or even countries work. I think about the Eurotunnel project between the UK and Europe. That's a transformational project that completely changed not only the transport situation, but the whole economy around it. If you think about the biggest tunnels in Alps, it's not about shortening travel by 15 minutes. The alternative is a few hundred kilometers long detours through mountains. If you think about this primitive civilizations, early humans, for one guys being on one side of Alps and the others being on the other side, that was like a few days of travel at best. And now they're just one tunnel trip beyond. So that is truly transformational from a societal point of view. And to finish up with huge city-shaping projects, like Memorial Tunnel comes into my mind, sorry. Memorial is the fire counterpart, but it was all about putting an intersection of highways underneath Boston to recover the city for its citizens. So you being in this community for quite long, So you being in this community for quite long, did you observe this transformational role to society being done with this project? Yeah, no, I think – and your cases are really good. I'm old enough and certainly ugly enough to have been in Boston and actually saw those projects get rolled out. I stood there and watched the roads taken from above and put below. I remember I think it was the Gillette factory was there and they were busy going around the Gillette factory again to put stuff underneath. And I've seen something similar in Madrid with the Calo 30 and Metro projects. They're just absolutely transformational for the cities. And you're right, it's like liberating the city for the people again, making the space human. And I think that type of transformational infrastructure really hits the nail on some of these SDGs, you know, these 21st century SDGs like sustainable cities and communities, you know, item number 11 or decent work and economic growth or life on the land, all these sorts of things. I think they're wonderful. But I think we need to pause and be very clear that they really are delivering and we're not just letting a government put up a project for the sake of putting up another underground project. For me, this century now, with all the troubles we have as humanity and the environment, we really need to stop and go, does it really stack up for the planet and our people right now? and our people right now. But, yeah, what I've seen, I wouldn't be going to be president of the ITA if I wasn't absolutely 100% committed to the transformational capabilities of underground infrastructure. I mean, they're just, the things that they can do for people and planet are just without peer. But, but, got to do it right and got to make sure that we're attention to detail. So, yeah, no, I've seen it. It's true. I like working on this project. So they have nice cling to it. They're massive. They're, as you said, intergenerational. They will be here for 100 years. So if you do a good job there, it's a well-done job for many, many years. Now, in your presentation or in the paper that was counterpart to the presentation you've mentioned, there unfortunately were projects that were cancelled because of the sustainability goals. Like some metro project in Germany that was signed off because of the sustainability policies, whatever that was. because of the sustainability policies, whatever that was. So now we're entering some crazy realm in which a thing that you and me are convinced is sustainable can be signed off because of the sustainable legal. And that worries me. That worries me. Are we doing a good job talking about this? Like you've said that we need to learn. Are we doing a good job talking about this stuff? Like you've said that we need to learn. We need to relearn the communication to be able to explain these benefits in the language that the stakeholders will understand. And unfortunately, our stakeholders in here are politicians, which is a difficult breed to talk. So, yeah, let's go to talking the talk. What's up with that? What do we need to learn as engineers? Yeah, that paper I wrote because it dawned on me when that German project got questioned and then subsequently too there's been quite a lot of press over the recent new openings in the UK, the new mezzo there, and various commentary saying, could this be the last of public transport as we know it being built in the UK? And if I hadn't thought about this before, when I'd read that headline, I probably would have fallen off my chair. How could it be this the last? And when you sort of dig down into it, it seems that the world is desperate for small-scale solutions. They're now talking about the 15-minute city. People are becoming, I think perhaps post COVID, even less inclined to want to share a space with other people for transport, whereas we might have been happy to jump on a metro train and share it with our, you know, 300 of our closest new best friends for 20 minutes, people are less inclined to want to do that. They're more inclined to want to take a 15 minute from their home, perhaps using one of these new forms of personalised public transport, one of these little battery scooters or whatever, not even a push bike. I mean, I can't believe I'm so old that a push bike is now considered old-fashioned. Like what? How did a push bike become old-fashioned? And how did walking become so uncool? You have to be on one of these new high-tech battery platform thingies to propel you the 15 minutes to your point of origin. So if that's true and if we're witnessing a social change and a social change of expectation of what it means to be in a city, then some of the concepts and rationale for the things we build is questioned, are being questioned. And in order to rise to the occasion of those questions, we have to talk the talk because the engineering talk, I don't think is going to do it anymore. Like we, I mean, gosh, we'd love to talk about the aquifers of the, you know, the ancient Greeks or how wonderful the Romans were and look at their tunnels and point to the tunnels in Paris and New York and London and Sydney and Beijing and Moscow. And we want to talk about all of that, but no one much wants to hear about that now. Now they want to talk about, well, how's this going to impact my lifestyle? How's this going to impact my life balance? How is this going to impact my lifestyle? How is this going to impact my life balance? How is this going to impact life on the land? Is it going to have some carbon footprint? What's the carbon footprint? How much of that am I responsible for? Surely there's a smaller solution to this. Couldn't we just put in a track or something and use my little micro scooter to zoom along to get my 15 minutes? All of this, I think we've really got to get our head around it because the world needs us more than ever, more than ever, to help with the challenges that we currently face. I mean, my goodness, here we are talking about stopping a metro on the basis of a sustainability option, and within, what, four or five hours' flight, there's probably a billion people who still don't have fresh water and sanitation. So how about, you know, how do we put this into context? How do we as citizens on the planet decide what, not only how do we talk this global agenda for one people, one planet, climate crisis, all that, not only think this getting the narrative under our skin, accepting amongst engineers we can talk the engineering talk, but let's get this new way of talking and thinking as a language we really understand. So we can go into a meeting and say, yes, it's going to take a lot of carbon to build this particular underground piece of infrastructure, but you're going to have it for 500 years, if not more. And it's going to deliver reliable transportation solutions even with climate change, even just with natural climate variability. So really get on the front foot with the language. And that has to be good because it helps us understand what the politicians think are important, and it helps us understand what the communities are thinking are important, and it might even help us understand what is important, dare I say it. You've mentioned it's not only for communications, it's also to double-check ourselves. Are we within these goals? If the goals are the goals now that drive the projects, that drive the choice of the projects, we need to be sure that we're within them. Otherwise, our projects will be cut off. And my podcast is obviously targeted at fire safety engineers, not the presidents of large companies that would lobby for a tunnel being built, or people who would lobby. But still, we have an important task in here by providing safety, and safety is one of the biggest concerns in relation to tunnels, especially in Europe after Mont Blanc tunnels and other large tunnel fires. And you chopped in the discussion on this fire safety. Like fire safety become the number one thing being discussed. And I see it on the projects. I see it on the ground that when we talk to the tunnel, fire safety is maybe number one topic in there. Like how do we do it? And here in the view of sustainability question is, are we delivering sustainable fire safety? Because, you know, safety for safe of being safer, from my perspective, is not always the best choice. How safe can you be? That's a good question that we need to answer. How safe a tunnel needs to be and how much work in there we should put. I'm thinking about, for example, a difference between making, I don't know, spending a lot of money on passive fire protection or maybe making a tunnel a little bigger because bigger is inherently safer in terms of fire. And we don't take these decisions based on engineering assessment. We just speak the code and follow the rules. Maybe we should think a little more. Wow, you know how to cut to the really sort of tough questions straight up. Yeah, that's the point. Well, what you've just raised, these issues around safe, what's safe enough, also what resources are required to deliver a particular level of safety, and then even your just casually in passing saying, well, we could just make it a little bigger and that would make it inherently more safe. Oh, my, this is it. This is the whole narrative sustainability agenda right there in your sentences. And can I just peel them back? I'll just peel some layers off the onion there. So I investigate disasters. You know that. Like I went after Mont Blanc. I went there. I gave some advice. It doesn't matter to who, but I was there. I've investigated other disasters around the world, some of them known, some of them not known. It won't come as a surprise to your listeners to know most of the disasters in Tunnel we don't talk about because they're kept secret, of course. And we know that underground humans are extremely vulnerable to being injured and killed because it's a confined space. Let's just cut to the chase. And we also have not just the confinement in terms of the toxic gases, but we've also got this confinement and retransmission or reflection of radiation. So you've also got this, the underground oven effect down there as well. So you've sort of got the worst of all worlds. And then to add insult to injury, if it's not going so well, the damn thing collapses as well because of the structural integrity consequences. I mean, the good news being, if that happens, you're usually long and truly being killed anyway, because, you know, to actually hurt the structure like that is very severe. But okay, so leaving, so okay, we've got this underground space and it's inherently dangerous. One of the troubles I think that we face as fire engineers is we get fixated on making the tunnel as safe as we can. You know, and we look in the mirror and go, oh, could we do something better? And we look in the mirror and go, oh, could we do something better? Could we add some more ventilation? Could we change the monitoring systems? Could we offer some better passive protection? Oh, no, let's put some active fire suppression. Are our human factors in order? Could we do better communications? Can we control the people entering? Can we better help them evacuate? Are the evacuation pathways well lit? Are they intuitive? Can they get out? Do the doors work? So we get into this very interesting discussion about how it is that we're going to make it safe. And I think one of the risks that we run is we forget to stop and check the context of our tunnel. We become so passionate about our tunnel and looking after our tunnel that we forget that the very people who use our tunnel have just come in off the street. How's the street out there? What's the lighting like out there for them? Is there snow on the road? Has there been maintenance of there? Is the train okay? Has it been maintained? Like there's a whole lot of other contextual things. So I think as part of the new narrative, as part of this requirement that we consider sustainable cities and communities and the responsible consumption and production of everything from energy to equipment to what have you. And as part of our commitment to good health and wellbeing, and as part of our commitment to economic growth, and these are all the sustainability development goals. I'm not just randomly picking them off. I mean, they're actually the goals. I think we have to put things into context and be more willing to go safe enough, not as safe as we could make it, but safe enough. Because if we don't, society loses because we divert disproportionately effort into our tunnel and we may achieve a higher level of safety. But in doing so, we demonstrably reduce the level of safety for our people elsewhere. And for me, that's the tension that we have to be mindful of. And you know, I'm passionate about my tunnel safety and my fire safety in my tunnels. And the example that I'd give, for me, the absolute classic example here is, do we let dangerous goods in our tunnels? Whether it's rail tunnels or road tunnels or whatever tunnels, do we let dangerous goods in? And for those of us who are technical people who just love tunnels, go to bed at night dreaming about tunnels, you know, we have postcards of tunnels on our walls. We're like, oh gosh, on holidays, I'd love to go and see that new tunnel in Germany. Let me go have a look. Oh, it looks gorgeous. For those of us who are into our tunnels, we very easily start to worship them as if they're just a god in their own right, they're some special thing, but they're not. They're part of a rich tapestry of social investment and infrastructure there to serve our people and there to serve the environment. And with dangerous goods, often I think the risk is that if you stop the dangerous goods from going through tunnels which otherwise could have dangerous goods, what you're really doing is you're subjecting to harm large numbers of people who are along the alternative routes. And you're not even letting them know. You're not saying, oh, by the way, it's because we love tunnels. We love tunnels more than you. We're going to send these dangerous goods up past your school and past your hospital and where you live and what have you. When in fact, if we were being more holistic, if we were taking that new narrative approach of what's best for us as a people and what's best for us as a planet, we probably say put them through the tunnel because actually the chances of something going wrong in the tunnel are less because actually it's very well managed down there because we know our tunnels are awesome. And in the unlikely event that something does go wrong, yes, there's going to be a disaster in the tunnel and yes, there's going to be people injured and worse, but there's going to be a lot less than if it was up on the surface. I think that's tough. I think this is part of the challenge that I'm sort of raising for us as professionals around the world to take a breath, almost like smell the flowers, like stop. Have a little think about what we do and ask ourselves, what's better for us as a collective, like the community generally, the environment actually, how can we use our tunnels better and how do we communicate that? I hope that's not too weird an answer, but I'm quite passionate about it because it's not what you expect. Even the size, you said the size of the tunnel. Even if you increase the size of the diameter of a tunnel by just a little bit, because the area, cross-sectional area of a tunnel varies as pi r squared, just a small increase in the radius causes a massive increase in the amount of material that has to be excavated and the amount of concrete to build it. So it's a, again, it's like we as engineers know that because we know the formulas, but it's really easy to go, oh, we'll just make it a bit bigger because a bit bigger will be a bit safer. And then on the other hand, you go, hang on, but a bit bigger, that'll increase our carbon footprint. Just say we increase, I haven't got a calculator in front of me, but a metre or two extra on the diameter of a tunnel might change the carbon footprint by a factor of 40%. It's just so huge because of that change to the area of what has to be built. So fascinating in the detail. Yeah. On a recent project, we've changed the cross-section of the tunnel by just changing the ventilation from transversal to longitudinal. Like we've proven to the guys that you not only get a simpler system, easier to maintain, less scenarios, because it just turns on, not having to pick up which part of the tunnel you have to extract the gases from. So you cut off a whole bunch of systematic issues with it, charging in the wrong place. You also, in some twisted way, because you freed, let's say, two meters underneath your ceiling during the evacuation phase, a seven-meter-tall tunnel gives you better evacuation chances than a five-meter-tall tunnel with a transversal system. A hundred percent, yeah. Because it's insane how much it changes. And here, you would actually reduce the carbon footprint because suddenly you don't have to do mezzanine sealing. And I don't mean that we should turn all the tunnels from transversal to longitudinal because that's also not the case. But you have to be smart about it and understand the consequences of the technology used in the tunnel. Like, we often go by the book, okay, it's 3,000 meters and one long, so it must be ventilated in this way. And I had this approach because, as I said in a conference not long ago, please let engineers build the tunnels, not lawyers. Like, you really don't want your lawyer to build your infrastructure. And here you've also mentioned you may run out of resources. Like if we're talking about things in civil engineering, like fire protection of walls, and you have hundreds of buildings around your city being built, it's not true that you're going to run out of resources because each of them is funded independently and so on. But when you're talking about a major city like Warsaw that I live in, we have a certain budget, The city has a certain budget. And if a tunnel costs us one-tenth of that budget, it's a really tough decision whether are we going to build the tunnel or are we going to make significant improvements in the healthcare and education in the city. It's this kind of choice. So in here, spending the money reasonably is really important. And I would like to go back to your dangerous goods, because I think we also, due to the way how projects work, like you design the tunnel, you build the tunnel, you deliver the tunnel, then it's the client's problem. I don't think we are involved enough at the operational phase. There is so much you can do with operational policies and good management. I don't see really fire. I know plenty of fire engineers who design tunnels. I don't know a single one who would be managing a tunnel or who would be involved in building operational policies in their agency, whichever that is that governs the tunnels. Whereas like the decision, do we let dangerous goods into the tunnel? It doesn't have to be taken by me today for the next hundred years. It can evolve, it can adapt to the environment, it can change. And I think it's a beautiful opportunity for a sustainable cause. As you mentioned, the tunnels are intergenerational. We also have the legacy of hundreds of kilometers of tunnels that were built by our grandparents and we can use them, we can upgrade them, we can use them better. So I think our involvement should expand beyond the design stage or the delivery stage into the whole lifecycle of the infrastructure. I'm your new best friend, if this is what you're thinking. Because, oh, absolutely. I think fire engineers are like cloistered sort of religious people. If you could just let them out and experience the push and shove of day-to-day operations and the challenges of refurbishment and responding to the needs, industrial, social needs as they change in time, I think your fire engineers have a much more exciting job. I know for me, getting away from just the design, like you were talking about before, what does it say according to the book? Oh, it's over 3,000 metres, 3,001, therefore we've got to do this or we've got to do that. That's the lowest form of fire engineering. In fact, it's not even really fire engineering. It's more like cooking cakes from a recipe book or something that's just that's just horrible but but like you say if you can take advantage of smoke reservoirs within an underground cross-section which is what we were talking about before but not using the term this is fantastic because they just work. Like, they work. The reservoir works. We've got, you know, we've got heat. We've got buoyant smoke. We now have got a window, an envelope of safety by virtue of the volume of the tunnel. You're 100% right. And yet, I only see that recognised in some of the international standards. It's something that is included in NFPA 502. I know because I put it in there. Well, I mean, I put up a proposal and got voted up. But personally, fellow fire engineers out there, I love passive fire engineering because it just works. So voids, I love them. I really like it if you can have passive vent as well. I was involved with a railway tunnel where we cantilevered the roof. It was a cut-and-cover intersection so that the bigger the fire, the greater the tunnel naturally ventilated itself using its own buoyancy or the buoyancy effect of the combustion products. And you could model it and shock horror, the bigger the fire, the better it worked. And I think fire engineers want to be liberated from this code nonsense. It's a good start, but get into some really serious engineering, which they can do when they get into the operational realm. And the operators need us to do it as well. Otherwise, our concepts don't make sense for the operators and they end up having some weird system with a set of manuals on how to use it that don't make sense for them as an operator. They might make sense for us as we get all excited about, I don't know, roughness coefficients or buoyancy criteria or Reynolds numbers or something, but they want the practicality. So now I'm with you. Let's get the fire engineering into the practice of refurbishment, optimizing. What more can we do with this tunnel? How could we do it better? Creativity, adjustment, all that sort of thing. The stuff we engineers love to do. Yeah, and it's very rewarding. I'm building a relation with the managers of the tunnel in Warsaw that we have been involved in the design. We have been involved in delivering commissioning. Now I'm trying to stay in touch with the people who manage the tunnel. And we did some solutions there. Like we did a – actually, I'm trying to stay in touch with the people who manage the tunnel. And we did some solutions there. We did a... Actually, I'm going to tell a full story. So we have realized that every bad thing that happens in the tunnel starts with a stopped vehicle. You cannot have a fire if a vehicle has not stopped in the tunnel. It's not there anymore. You cannot have an accident in the tunnel if the vehicles are still moving and driving out of the tunnel. It's not there anymore. You cannot have an accident in the tunnel if the vehicles are still moving and driving out of the tunnel. So every bad scenario in its avid tree would have a vehicle stopped at some point. So we've realized that, okay, the number one issue with delivering safety in our project is the vulnerability of the tunnel to the flows caused by the atmosphere, by the cars. When we start the ventilation, it takes a few minutes to control them. In your simulation, you're very nice because in your time zero, you have flow equals zero, and then you start having your fantastic wind plume. But if you're in a tunnel that's operational, you know that the flow is not zero in there. Very, very not zero. So we should go like, okay, so if the first thing happening is a vehicle that stops and we have cameras that can detect it, let's just start the ventilation the moment a vehicle stops there. Like maybe not in fire mode, but let's start at least some sanitary mode ventilation that will stop the flow. but let's start at least some sanitary mode ventilation that will stop the flow. And it would build, you know, this background for good operation of the fire mode if it will be necessary. And if not, just turn it off and go on with your life. And we were very proud with this because it's a very simple and robust solution in our mind. But now I talk with the operational guys on the tunnel and they say, yeah, but, you know, our biggest problem now is to continuously monitor that because people stop there to pee in the tunnel, which I don't really understand as a concept, but they do. And this triggers the system 10, 20 times a day. And it causes stress in them because every time they have to check it, what's happening, the citizens around are complaining because the fans are loud and stuff like that. And they're like, okay, well, it's not really helpful at this point. And if I just been there in the design phase, I would be happy with my design that in my head was brilliant, they would be happy because they just turn it off and they go on with their lives and it's not annoying for them. But here I have this sense, maybe not of a failure, but an opportunity to make it better. Because from my perspective, what I wanted to achieve was to control the flow in the tunnel. So maybe I don't need the extraction, maybe I just need the jet fans to operate and we'll achieve the same goal. So we're going to modify it now. But it was not me and my personal relation with the management guys in there trying to talk with them like, hey, how does it work for you? Is it convenient for you to be used? Do you see problems with the system? And I was not really asking about this particular feature of the system, but general. Do you see user problems with the system that can be solved? If it was not that, the design would not really work. So you need an engineer over the life. Because in the end, if you design a fancy system, but it's being turned off, it was a shitty system to start with. It's really interesting you've had that experience. What we're seeing around the world at the moment, and it might be this, so I'm really curious as to your answer, is lay-bys, breakdown lanes, even big shoulders are increasingly used as places to stop and pee, have a picnic, join the, I don't know, making babies in the tunnel club or whatever it is you want to do. Make a nice picture. Yes, make a nice picture. And we're seeing a trend towards not having shoulders anymore, not having breakdown bays, but relying more on the intelligent detection systems for what's happening in the tunnel and turning every lane into an emergency lane. So if you've got a vehicle which stopped, then you stop all the, you close that lane. And that seems to be reducing what you've just described, which is the people have a pee and all the rest of it. But it is an international phenomenon. There's people not recognising that stopping in a tunnel is inherently incredibly dangerous because from a fire and life safety point of view, exactly as you say, it's the stopped vehicle that's most likely to cause the problem, even if it's not on fire. Because guess what? When it tries to merge now back out into the traffic, the probability of a collision occurring is now much greater as well. So I think it's a great example that you raise and it's highlighting this is a real moving target and a moving target for the fire engineers who have to be partly transportation engineers, who have to be partly human factor engineers, who have to have a knowledge of system engineering as well. It's just really mission-critical stuff you're talking about. And now for the end, I'm going to ask you a really tough question. You already asked me tough questions. You're going to ask me more tough questions. No, these were like warm-up, these were easy questions. These were fun questions. I'll brace myself. these were easy questions. These were fun questions. I'll price myself. Yeah. So I have this challenge. Road tunnels are fun, but I'm also involved a lot in railway tunnels. And in railway tunnels, we often go with the assumption that the train needs to reach the place of safety, being a station or some dedicated space where we can extract smoke, extract people. But we still have to design the systems, life safety systems, ventilation and so on, for the tunnel itself, when the train stops in it. And I'm in a really tough position how to communicate to my stakeholders that if you allow low trained to stop in the middle of a tunnel and you have longitudinal system because like transversal system in a railway would be crazy. The survival of the person is at large governed by chance. It depends where you are, where the fire is and where the ventilation is. If you're on the correct side, you're pretty good because you're going to end up in a safe space. If you're on the wrong side, there's a good chance you'll be overwhelmed with smoke. And I find these discussions really, really difficult. And on the other hand, I feel helpless. Like, that's the physics. There is not much I can do about it. And so far we go with, like, some sort of risk analysis that can demonstrate that the risk is low. You know, the probability of a failure of a train is very low. The probability of a fire is even lower. So we're talking about inherently very exotic event that would happen and most likely will not in a thousand years. But still, you're dealing with a politician. For a politician, it's never okay to say, okay, I'm okay with it if the train stops, someone dies there. So how to communicate that risk, how to work out solutions with non-fire stakeholders when you're essentially given a problem that you cannot solve? Maybe you know a solution. The answer is 12, of course. It's a numerical answer of 12. No, you've, again, this is a really tough question because it highlights the difference between the mental models that we use as scientists and engineers to engineer and to manage risk in terms of the activity of being on a train in an underground metro system and how we deal with it. And the common narrative amongst people, which is, well, when it happens, is it safe? And you're like, well, hang on a minute, that's the wrong question because when it happens, it's not going to happen because it doesn't happen because we know it doesn't happen because that's what we engineers know about. I don't think there's a simple answer, but it does get back to this, again, I think the sustainability argument where you have to accept that in everything we do, there's a residual level of risk just by virtue of being. And I mean, gosh, as fire engineers, we know about it. It's called oxidation. Like everything is always just a slight breath away from being oxidized. If it oxidizes slow, it's not our problem. That's our thing. If it oxidizes very quickly, it's our problem. Yeah. And you say to someone, say we're discussing tenability and you say, well, actually there's an oxidation reaction occurring in our lungs. And so long as that's occurring at about the right rate, we're fine. But if we get a bit on the wrong side of the curve, we asphyxiate and die, right? It's an oxidation question and also obviously a gas exchange question. But I think we're in a really strong position with metros right now in the world. And the reason we're in a really strong position is right now the numbers are clear. We've got a huge explosion, no pun intended, in the number of metros operating around the world. There are billions of passenger journeys occurring all the time with them, and they're not catching on fire, and they're not stopping in tunnels and people aren't dying. Now, it doesn't mean that there won't be an event. Of course, there might be an event and mathematically with so many billions of journeys occurring, it might occur. But so long as we as engineers and the allied professionals maintain our rigorous approach to all things underground rail and that is from the reliability of the catenary system, the signaling system, the rolling stock, the way we section the power, the way we timetable, the way we build the rolling stock, the way we isolate traction systems from the areas in the carriages where the people are, so long as there's redundancy in the traction systems themselves, so long as the grades, the materials, the auditing to confirm and to verify the performance of the wiring, to confirm and verify the performance of the materials in the seating, so long as we've still got the vigilance over attending the railway system, so long as people aren't allowed to take their barbecues and cook sausages on the trains while they're driving them, like so long as that incredibly complicated total engineering system, which we do so well, so long as we continue to do it so well, and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't continue to do it so well, then for me, the theoretical event of a fire on a disabled train in a tunnel with longitudinal ventilation, where some of the passengers of that train are upstream of the ignition point, the combustion point, and therefore will be exposed to a non-tenable environment and therefore will die because they've got no option, that is such an infinitesimally small risk and demonstrably so that it's okay. risk and demonstrably so that it's okay. And if it's not okay, then I think this is where having the narrative on board to talk about what it means. If that's not okay, then maybe we can't afford to build a metro anymore. I love your answer because it's more or less like do your best job at doing longitudinal ventilation, reach the goals of the system, and not over-design it five times because you need to provide safety in the most awkward situation. I agree. I also don't see a way out of this problem, of this conundrum, but to rely on all the other aspects of the safety system you've mentioned, minus the grilling, I would not grill in the trade. But you're right. And to understand that, you have to look from the top. You need to have a bird's eye view. You need to have a holistic view. It's nice. It's a nice and popular word lately, but it is. You need to, if you look only on providing safety through the lens of the smoke control system, you're going to have a bad time because you are set to fail. There literally is no way for you to achieve the goals of your system and provide ultimate safety, whatever that is. Only through systematic thinking and a bird's eye view on the problem, you can find an answer that it actually may be all right because the numbers are there. There is no systematic inherent huge risk of that occurring. I think the trick is remaining vigilant. So from fire engineering point of view, I'd say, and this is where your point before about the fire engineers coming out to the world of operational regime, as a fire engineer, get into the operational railway and be the voice of fire engineering and saying, everybody, we do have to check the cables in our rolling stock to make sure they're still performing in accordance with their, say, volatile generation in the event of a fire. We still have to check that our upholstery is performing in the way that expected. We still should challenge, like do some fire tests in real rolling stock. Say we have some old rolling stock that we're retiring, volunteer it for some fire tests. Let's just double check and see if at year 20 it's still performing as it was at year one or what have you. I think, and that's, for me, that's what the fire engineers of today and moving forward have got to do. They've got to almost be the challenge team reminding the somewhat complacent organisation that there's a very high level of fire engineering sitting in behind this network that makes it so safe and you shouldn't assume that nothing's changed. Actually, challenge it, check it, make sure everything is still performing as expected. I had a case where the cleaning fluids that were being used for upholstery in some existing rolling stock actually decreased the fire performance of that material and basically converted fire-hardened rolling stock into sort of fireworks. And so there's, you know, a case where the devil's in... That's not something you would think about. That's not something you would check in the laboratory. No, no. And that's where I think for your listeners as fire engineers and careers, long-term careers, entwining themselves within operational regimes of infrastructure and continually stressing and rechecking those design presumptions that they would have, they or the generations of fire engineers before them, would have plugged into the design concept. And yeah, challenge, what's changed? One thing that I've noticed lately, I don't know about in your country, but I've seen it in a couple of countries, is the availability of high temperature personal torches, these little flame generating devices. So you, like a person who wants to commit an antisocial act can actually get about a six or 700 degree flame just by a little thing that they're carrying in their pocket. There's a change. You know, when we did our fire engineering, we were expecting a crib with some cellulose fire with a newspaper. But, you know, maybe the latest generation of antisocial person's got a 600C torch sitting in his pocket or her pocket or its pocket, and they're going to give a bit of a tickle to our rolling stock. How awesome is that in terms of, as a fire engineer, moving forward with the challenges of this millennium? That's the Arsenal's daily podcast. So that's the improvements in the Arsenal technology. Okay, Arnold, I've intended so much more for this interview, which means we need to book a part two, which will dwell on Elon Musk, Hyperloops, and maybe the Lion City concept of Saudi Arabia, which is based around the tunnel. So I would love to book a part two. Anyways, I would like to summarize this to the listeners and just find the number one learning point from today. For me, the learning point is, I think this operational thing would be the number one. If tunnels are intergenerational, if tunnels are going to outlive its designers, maybe it's their operators who should be more educated in fire safety. And for fire safety engineers, there's a whole world to discover in the operational side where we can really shine. That's a bright lesson, a very positive one. So what would be your final message? No, I love it. I think you're right. And for the fire engineers, isn't that awesome? So what you've just realized and what we've explored is for the fire engineers, the design is just the beginning. And in this intergenerational world, intergenerational infrastructure, the future challenges are, I mean, they're almost boundless. And the fire engineers need to step in there and do their thing. I think it's wonderful. And a wonderful observation of yours. Thanks. I think it's wonderful and a wonderful observation of yours. Thanks. Well, thank you for leading me to that and what the journey it was from the sustainability to operational procedures. I told you we're going to start with sustainability and no one knows where we'll end. But we've reached a nice end. Arnold, thank you so much for coming into the show. And I really hope to see you here again. And at the end, congratulations for your significant achievements, the presidency of ITA. That's amazing, man. That's fantastic. The award from NFPA for lifetime contributions to the standards. Thank you so much for all you're doing today. Thank you so much for all you're doing today. Thank you. And thank you for your love of all things fire and life safety and operational safety for these things we build. Fantastic. Thanks for having me. It's been awesome. Thank you so much. And that's it. Thank you for listening to the part one of the interview with Arnold. It was such a fun and such an interesting thing to discover the opportunities lying within the operational regime of tunnels. I think it's a really great world of opportunities for fire engineers. And if we can start building relations with our investors, with our authorities, with tunnel management, with tunnel operators, it's opening a new world of career choices even. So I think it's really worth pursuing that. And on top of that, the whole sustainability that was in the back end of this episode, it is important. It is very important to communicate with these sustainability goals in mind because otherwise you will not get listened to. If you don't speak the same language as everyone does now if we stick to our safety engineering language we will not deliver safety we'll not engineer safety because we'll not be given a chance we need to learn to talk the talk as arnold said and as i've mentioned in the intro to the episode this is a two-part episode the next one's coming your way next week and it's full of interesting new technologies and challenges that lie within them so that's something you don't want to miss if you listen that long to this episode i am 100 sure you really want to listen the next one and i'm looking forward to that as well. So see you here again next Wednesday. Cheers. This was the fire science show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
