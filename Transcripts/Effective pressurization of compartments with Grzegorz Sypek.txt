 Hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show session 47. Today the podcast is taking a little twist into the world of engineering, more than science, but actually it's science-based and factual-based engineering, so it's very welcome in the podcast lineup. We're going to talk about pressurization systems or pressure difference systems, PDS, as they're going to be referred in the next episode a lot. And these types of solutions are used in different types of buildings, especially on evacuation routes, on stairwells, lobbies, sometimes corridors, in order to create a pressure difference that prevents smoke from entering the space that's protected. A very simple idea, very efficient potentially, and also an idea that is known to be quite difficult in employing in a real building. Many places of the world, people just do not believe these types of systems can work, or there's a history of these systems not giving the performance they were expected of. And for that reason, there's a lot happening in Europe. There's new standards that will be published very soon, EN 12.1.1 part 6 and 13. So this will be important step forward in creating a new future for pressurization systems. But it's not just standardization. We want to talk today more about the fundamentals of these systems and in a way a Polish twist in their design which led to creation of very successful applications which have been used in practice in dozens if not hundreds of buildings, also very tall buildings with great success. And yeah, that's the story we want to share with you today. My guest for this topic is Grzegorz Sypek. He was an engineer at the company SMEI who developed one of the first adaptive pressure resistance systems in Poland. And now he's an independent consultant who also works with BDS systems. He has worldwide experience from Middle East to Europe. And also he has been an active member of CEN committees that wrote the standards I've just mentioned. So he's definitely a good person to talk about the systems being used in Poland, how they're different from the solutions around the world, and how can we actually provide safety through pressurization in very tall buildings. I hope this is an exciting topic. It is for me, for sure. So I hope you'll enjoy it. And yeah, let's not prolong this. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I will be your host. Hello and welcome to the Firesize Show. I'm here today with a good friend, Grzegorz Supak. Hello Grzegorz, great to have you in the podcast. Hi Wojciech, good to hear you. I'm glad to be here. Thanks, I'm glad to have you in the show. Today we're going to talk about the important thing that is specializations of various compartments in fire as a means to protect spaces. But before we start, I would like to say a few words. I would like to dedicate this episode and recording to our mutual friend, Michał Kozek, who unfortunately went missing a year ago on Madeira. Michał was very active in the pressurization community in Poland and in Europe, a member of CN committee working on the pressurization standards, member of SFP and a good colleague. So, Michał, wherever you are, we're thinking about you and missing you, man. This is for you. Yeah, exactly. This is for him. This is for you. Okay, Grzegorz, so there is this funny thing, pressurization systems. And in Poland, we routinely go into 200-meter-tall skyscrapers, install our PDS systems in there, commission them, and they just work. And whenever you step outside of Poland and tell that to someone, they go like, it's impossible. They don't work like that. It's not going to work. And yet here, standing with, I think, 15 years of experience in applying these types of solutions, we seem to have built a national confidence in this field of protection. So I'm really wondering, what's the difference between the Polish way of pressurizing buildings and some things you observe outside of Poland? It's the same pressure. I just feel we're in like completely two parallel universes, one of which technical solutions are really advanced and amazing, and that is Poland, and in the world where people just don't believe in this type of systems. Well, yeah, that's a very good question, and it's good to start from this particular question. From my point of view, actually, PDS, we can discuss a lot whether PDS works or not. That depends on the project, that depends on the quality of different works, and that depends on a variety of different factors. However, from my point of view, we don't have alternatives for the time being. So we use such systems regardless whether we like it or not. The only issue is that we can do it in the right way or we can do it in a little bit... European way, sorry. Well, in a global way, which is a little bit old school way from today's perspective. Now, the world is changing continuously. So the same thing happens when we talk about the PDS. So if we discuss systems, multiple injection systems, multiple point air supply systems, constant capacity fan and mechanical pressure relief damper at the top of the stairwell, it may be not sufficient for advanced buildings. Look at the modern buildings. They are getting taller. They are getting more advanced. We collect a variety of different data out of those buildings. It is packed with electronic devices, so I don't see any particular reason that we shouldn't follow the same manner, I mean, go the same way when it comes to fire safety systems. Especially since this is not something which is only fancy, you know, sometimes it is highly required to design fully functional PDS for a given building. Okay, I'll give some background to our friends outside of Poland on what happens in here. So, as Grzegorz mentioned, constant capacity inlet fan and the pressure relief damper would be a common way to pressurize different compartments in many buildings. However, in Poland, we have more active systems. I mean, it's funny when you think about it. Now everyone is talking about Internet of Things and advanced smart buildings and everything. And in Poland, in terms of pressurization systems, wow, that's exactly what we have. It's just we didn't call it like that 10 or 15 years ago when these things were born. And now you say that they're not only fancy, but they truly have better capabilities than solutions that were used for decades over the world. Maybe I know you were there when these systems were invented, developed, designed, engineered. Maybe you can tell us the story how you went from, or maybe how you didn't even go to the route of pressure relief damper. What was the thing that pushed you into these smart systems and how this revolutionized the Polish market in the early 2010s. You were there. You've seen it. Yeah, yeah. I've been there, you know. I still remember it well. So it's, you know, basic idea was to really solve the problem, not to hide the problem. Because, you know, what we do globally in terms of personalization or PDS, let's call it PDS, it's more comprehensive because this is not only personalization. We wanted to solve the problem, in terms of pressurization or PDS, let's call it PDS, it is more comprehensive, because this is not only pressurization. We wanted to solve the problem, and the problem was that in very tall buildings, especially in cold climate or very warm climatic zones, there were significant problems with stack effect, a variety of different factors, I mean, a variety of different phenomenas, which are not discussed at all, actually, at the moment, for the time being. For instance, air flow resistance of the stairwell. We supply quite huge amounts of air to the stairwell, and we've got one opening at the top of the stairwell, so the air has to flow through the stairwell, and we've got some specific airflow resistance of the stairwell. And our objective, let's start with the objectives. Our objective is to have specific pressure difference across the door or the fire compartment at the fire floor. So we want to have positive pressure in the protected space and some reference pressure, not necessarily negative pressure in the fire compartment or the fire floor. Sorry, with pressure in the protected space being higher than on the other side. Exactly. Making sure that... Exactly. To keep vertical or not necessarily vertical, but escape routes free of smoke, to prevent infiltration of smoke and to have directed airflow from the protected space to somewhere else outside the protected space. Again, to prevent smoke from coming into the protected space. And let's say standard PDS operates in two modes. One mode is pressure mode, where when we have all doors closed, I mean, the protected space is more or less airtight. And the other one is airflow mode when we open the door. And it strongly corresponds to the fire scenario or evacuation scenario from the building. So there is a huge discussion on how many doors shall be open simultaneously at the same time. And it depends. It is not like each and every time we can open three doors, for instance, into the stairwell. It depends. And so we have started, let's say we have started from the scratch. We made sure that PDS available at that time are not sufficiently advanced to be applied or to be installed in very tall buildings. And that was the starting point for the entire discussion. Then we have decided to do some real-scale tests, and we have carried out such tests in Krakow in a 90-meter-tall tower. It was actually a part of the high-rise building, which was like 30 years old at that time, but it was very useful because we were able to do the tests for over two years in the real scale, which is quite unique in the global scale, because each and every time when I look at the PDS, I either see CFD or some analytical calculations, you know. There are very few. Or small-scale experiments. Exactly. And we went for the huge project, which was very useful to develop and to design the final version or final shape of the PDS. So we wanted to solve a few important problems. We wanted to solve the stack effect issue problem, and we wanted to solve wind influence problem, because both are very important and both are different, because, you know, stack effect is rather static. I mean, it results from temperature differences inside and outside the building. So, you know, the temperatures don't change that much, whereas when we talk about wind, it is very dynamic. So we wanted to have a solution for both. So we went through the internet, we went through, you know, different design concepts or these different BDS concepts available at that time. And we didn't find anything which was, you know, sufficient from our point of view to be installed in the building. So we developed a system, let's say, active control system, which is modular, but it's very important. Very often it happens that, you know, PDS are being designed for specific projects. So we take different components and integrate them on site, which is not a very reasonable approach because it is very important. The interactions between components are very important. So we wanted to have a well-defined modular solution, which would be suitable for different buildings, and the architecture of the PDS would vary depending on the height of the building. And the same system can be used to protect or to pressurize vertical escape routes, lift shafts, and firefighting lobbies. Because when we talk about PDS, it is very important to point it out that we are talking about a huge part of the building. We are not talking about the stairwell only. Because when I, when I've been living in Dubai for two years, you know, and each and every time when I discussed PDS there, it was the stairwell. Stair pressurization system. That was how they called it. So it's way more than that. So yeah, the system was developed based on real-scale experiments, you know, supported by CFD analysis, and then laboratory testing of the components of the kits. We'll talk it over a little bit later. Yeah, okay. Let's go back to fundamentals. You've mentioned it was designed to battle stack effect, and we know that many design guidelines, recommendations would say that you're ought to subdivide your vertical route into smaller sections, say, sections, yeah, 30 meters or something to prevent the stack effect. I think the underlying physics is that over 30 meters, the stack effect will not develop into very huge pressure because in a very tall building, you can have easily 100, 200 pascal from the stack effect only. So the idea was to cut it into subsections. But we also know that this is wishful thinking. If you have a stairwell and people are evacuating in it and someone opens doors to both of them which are interconnected with some compartment, the stack effect will not wait patiently until the path is sealed but it will just form. And I think this is a major problem in the systems that often wishful thinking is part of the design. You would omit some of the physics, omit some of the consequences, because otherwise it's very difficult to prove the system will be working. I should be surprised, but I'm not because as a consultant in the Polish market, I've seen buildings twice that high, which had modern PDS systems in them. More than that, I've been doing CFD and commissioning of these systems, and they just worked. So if possible, maybe you can share the magic how Stack was handled. Actually, there is a little magic in the overall concept for the BDS because it is strongly based on science and technology. And I hope you still remember that we had a chance to meet in Dubai in 2016 at the SFPE conference. And for one of the projects over there, actually in Dubai, for a 220-meter stone tower, we did a design concept and carried out some CFD simulations to prove that, you know, for this very, let's say, for this extremely warm part of the world, the system will work as well. Because in Europe, in the U.S., we mostly have problems during the wintertime, where it's colder outside than inside. So when the stairwell or the vertical escape routes operate more or less as chimneys in buildings, so there are moves from the bottom to the top of the building. But in the warm climate, we've got a reverse stack effect. And if you go to the hotel in Dubai and you take a look at the stairwell, you will see that there are swinging doors at the bottom of the stairwells, you know, and they are not closed all the time because they are partially open due to the stack effect. So we know the system, the problem is clearly visible in the buildings. The issue is that there is very little real scale tests and good commissioning of the systems across the entire world, more or less, because the knowledge about BDS is relatively low. But that's a different story. Coming back to your question, the magic, the magic, there is no magic, as I said. The overall idea is to leave or to supply air to the negative pressure zone and to exhaust it from the positive pressures. Because in each and every building, we will have both zones where there is a difference of air temperature outside and inside the building. So we supply air at the bottom in the wintertime and exhaust it at the top. And we do opposite during the summertime when the temperature differences are opposite. So we wanted to create airflow, directed airflow resistance, throughout the stairwell to produce specific pressure drop or airflow resistance throughout the stairwell, you know, to compensate the stack effect. The structure and architecture of the system is relatively simple because you've got air supply, you've got reversible fans at the bottom and at the top of the stairwell and you've got pressure differential sensors and you know some control panels to control the airflow inside the stairwell to produce specific pressure difference over pressure in the protected space and to create specific airflow resistance in the stairwell where during the times where we've got temperature differences outside and inside for, you know, isothermal conditions where there is no temperature difference, you just pressurize the thermal in the common way. But you have to keep in mind, you have to remember that the system, the architecture capacity of the system strongly depends on air leakage rate of the protected space. It strongly depends on air tightness of the protected space. It strongly depends on air tightness of the building facade. And it strongly depends on air release provided. Because, you know, air release, it is critical in most of the cases. And sometimes it is highly underestimated. Because in Poland, we mostly use mechanical air release for PDS, right? It results from our national regulations. Whereas in different countries it is being carried out in different manner. For instance, in Switzerland or in Germany, they mostly use natural air release. Therefore, I'm talking about PDS, not only about pressurization, because from my point of view, pressurization is just air supply side. I'll take you there just in a second. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and I'm sure what you just described as something you commonly use will be considered magic for many. And the realization that to create the necessary overpressure, you sometimes have to remove air. That's a kind of a brilliant thought and not one that you immediately get, but it really works to remove the air from the positive pressure zone in the part of the building where it is created. Basically, with this simple move, you reset the stack effect in the building, bringing it under control and being able to provide the pressurization, the designed pressure over the whole height of the building. That's brilliant. And now you've brought me into a very important subject. What do we do with the air that we supply? And this is extremely interesting because, as you mentioned, some people would consider it stairwell protection system or stairwell pressurization systems. And for me, I always thought that the stairwell is, in a way, the most important thing we protect. the most difficult thing to protect because during the evacuation and rescue operation processes, you just cannot be sure that it's going to be sealed in a way you expect it to be or the standards would expect it to be. But this is not the end of the protection. In Poland, a common thing would be a lobby or vestibule, however you call it, a small compartment next to your opening to the stairwell, to the elevator shafts, where you would have additional point of protection being a secondary PDS system or a secondary inlet designed in a very special way to always make sure this lobby is positive pressure against the corridors, you gain like an airlock part of your system, like in spaceships, in movies, it's just, you don't have to wear a space suit to enter that airlock. And now you open the doors to your fire room and we know fires make a lot of products, a lot of hot air. If there's water, it's just going to evaporate. So these all things are adding to pressure being in a way produced. I'm a scientist, I shouldn't say it like that. For the podcast, yeah. The pressure is being produced in there. So it's necessary to make sure that the route the air flows is from the staircase, from the lobby, through the floor and somewhere. Now, you've said a popular thing in Poland would be to provide mechanical outlets at the space that the fire is. So you basically suck the air from there in amounts that allows this flow path of air always form. In other solutions, you can open the windows, but what's the issue with that? Does the wind trouble you or why are you worried with the systems based on natural exhaust? As you already said, we are each and every time in very tall buildings and even in relatively low buildings where we use the PDS, we are dealing with phenomena that influence our PDS dynamically, I mean, in an active way. So it's hard to imagine that we can, you know, fight those phenomena and those interferences in a passive manner. You know, we have to react to what's happening in the building. So if anything is passive by default, it is very hard to imagine that it can counteract something which is highly dynamic. You know, when we talk about the air release, it has to be provided to have the airflow from the specific airflow, because each and every time we will have some airflow from the positive pressure zone into the fire floor. But it has to be, you know, specific value of this airflow because it's also defined by the standard. Actually, we are talking about airflow velocities from 1.0 meters per sec up to minimum, up to 2.0 meters per sec, depending on the fire scenario, I mean, evacuation scenario and, you know, intended use of the PDS because we are talking about evacuation or we are talking about evacuation and firefighting from site. So this is the face of the fire, depending on the face of the fire. In the initial phase, we assume that 1.0 ms is sufficient, whereas when the fire is fully developed, we need at least 2.0 ms from the pressurized and protected space into the fire floor to prevent smoke from coming into the protected space. What troubles me is that every solution has some bright sides and dark sides. And when we use the mechanical air release, it's more comfortable from design point of view, because when we suck air from the fire floor, from the fire compartment, from the air release path, it will flow from the positive pressure side to the air release, mechanically supported. But when we talk about natural air release, we have to keep in mind that the shafts would be significantly bigger. There is no fan at the top of the shaft to suck air and smoke from the fire floor. And it is even worse when we are opening the windows, because PDS tends to work properly where the building facade is airtight. Because if it's airtight, as for most of the modern buildings, because we are talking about different things that influences the airtightness of the facade, We are talking about different things that influences the airtightness of the facade. And the airtight facades are highly required at the moment because of energy use and things like that. But when we open the window with the given floor, we will equalize the pressures inside the building and outside the building, but only at this floor. So it is additional interference for our PDS. but only at this floor. So it is additional interference for our PDS. Because when the building is airtight, I mean, the entire facade is closed and tight, then we will have stack effect because it is very important to understand that stack effect happens and occurs not only in the vertical escape routes. It occurs in the entire building, I mean, inside the building. So when we are opening the facade to the ambient, we've got additional uncontrolled interference. So from my point of view, mechanical air release is a very good option, robust and very reliable. I'm also in favor of controlling. However, sometimes this is, I will admit, with Grzegorz here, we only touched the pinnacle of the engineering that goes into PDS systems. And even though we seem to make it quite easy that we have great solutions, we have great systems in Poland, we can manage that. It's not that you go into a PDS shop, pick a box from the shelf, drop it on your building and it works. There's a whole hell of design that goes along with that. And in here, it's not that we magically possess the knowledge to do that. It's, as Grzegorz mentioned, they have spent years in a real building, playing out, trying out solutions, testing what works, what does not work, and finding the correct combination of systems to finally create the first kit that went onto the market. Now, a decade later, we have multiple companies that specialize in delivering these types of systems. There's a lot of engineers who specialize in designing them in Poland. So by saying it's easy, I think in a way it's like in mathematics, you know, if the problem exists and it was solved, it's easy. If it was not solved, it's hard. Same here. You solved it, so it's easy. But to engineer it, it's a whole lot of work. Now I wanted to switch a bit to the much more fun aspect of designing new technology, new system, and that is standardization. I know you've been involved in writing the EN 12.1.1 Part 6 and Part 13 standards for like probably one third of your not very long life. No, the standards. No, it's a compliment. Thank you. You're welcome. But that's true that the standards have been written for more than the last decade. And you've been there for a long time. And now, today, many friends from the UK, many friends from other European countries are reaching out. They hear that we have experience with the 12.1.1, Part 6 and part 13 already, because we have, in fact, for the last decade, thanks to espionage of you and your colleagues, we've been working with the principles of these standards and we've put them into buildings already. So people are reaching, because the standards are about to be published, people are reaching to us to know our experience. So maybe you can tell us a few words about the standardization process of these standards, what's changing, what's the key differences, and do you think if this standard can truly open a new era for pressurization systems in Europe? And before you start, I will just think about your clever answer and I'm just going to briefly give introduction to why ALT 12.101 part 6 was horrible and created nothing but issues. So there was a standard, I think it was 2005 or 2006 published, harmonized. It was a standard that allowed to give CE marking to kids. The only issue is it did not give an answer how to do it. And that created a hell of a problem. It was more like a design standard on how to design a pressurization system to your building. By design, I mean calculate leakages and choose whatever performance criteria you want to achieve. That's really how to design it. And that was a source of very, very big problems because suddenly you have a harmonized standard. In EU, that means you can see a mark with that, but you really could not. And yeah, we had to find a way out. We found a way out through the projects of the new standards, through national assessments and building our own laboratory following the new procedures that were being born at the time. And yeah, Gzioros, tell us, how were they born and what's changing? What was the big fuss about? Actually, you've already touched the point. We used to have already with Xiaomi and 12.1.1.6 from 2005, based on BS, former BS standard. And it was a funny thing because it was a product harmonized European product standard which mostly dealt with design of this PDS. Fantastic. Thank you so much. It should have never been published actually so that was a decision and it was very common in Europe. It is still very common in Europe that we talk a lot about different things and we do it very slowly. So now we've got a new European revised EN 12.1.6, which will be a pure product standard, which probably depends, but I'm not sure if it's going to be harmonized European standard or not, but this is a different story. We need reliable and decent products to be installed in buildings when we are talking about fire safety, so it is clear for me. And we've got this set of European EN 101 standards. We built our PDS and not only PDS, different fire ventilation systems out of those components, so there is a huge discussion whether we can use this product or not, and we need harmonized European standards for different products. And the idea of EN-101 is very good. So it gives us clear recommendations and requirements for products installed in buildings. When we talk about design, this new European standard, EN-1211-13, design, this new European standard EN 12101 part 13, which will cover design, acceptance testing, commissioning, different things for the PDS in buildings. But there are some significant changes. The idea was it should be simpler, I mean, easier to apply, easier to use for designers because we used to have different classes. I mean, six classes of PDS in the previous E-Enthron follow-up part six. And now there are only two classes, A and B, and there are some changes. I'm not sure if it's revolution, but it's definitely easier to be used and to be understood from designers' point of view. And it's actually the most important thing for the standard to be successful on the market. I have, for years, I've heard that you don't have to use this standard because it is not obligatory to use this standard because it is not possible to harmonize or standardize the design process. However, when I look, you know, across the world, I mean, in different countries where I had the chance to work, I see that designers strongly prefer to use some standard, some design standard, because it's easier for them. It is safer for them. It is simply better. So I think this is very important that we have this standard in Europe, which is way more detailed than, for example, NFPA standard, which deals with PDS over there in America, in the US. So I think this is a step ahead. It is not perfect. It needs to be developed for over a decade, as you already mentioned. So I think in many cases, I mean, in many ways, it's already outdated. So I'm expecting that, you know, the revision of the standard will start soon. So this is the problem of Europe, you know, with this quite passive. And we need a lot of time to introduce important changes and updates. But nevertheless, I think it is a step ahead and I think it's going to be useful because there are some problems mentioned and listed and there are some solutions for those problems as well. So I think it's going to be a step ahead once published and it's going to happen soon. That's great. It's going to be a step ahead once published, and it's going to happen soon. That's great. I certainly appreciate the changes to 12.1.6 where it gives a testing methodology. As I've mentioned before, in the time where there was no good regulation, meaning that the existing standard was useless and we had to pursue the national assessment pathways to put these fire safety solutions on the market safely, we were heavily inspired by the work ongoing in your committees. And in fact, back then, we've already implemented all the electromagnetic, all the environmental compatibility tests for the parts of the kits to make sure from this perspective they are safe. And we have built a hydraulic laboratory to test the hydraulics aspects of these devices where we test its reliability and the capabilities of the system to achieve their performance points in terms of pressure or flow within a certain time from opening and closing the doors between the protected and the fire compartments. So there is quite advanced laboratory base already existing. Second oldest in the world, actually. So congrats on that. It's a huge achievement. Thank you. Thank you very much. And it has been extensively used already. I think we've went through at least 10 manufacturers of PDS systems in Poland and in Europe, in fact. And this also gives us a good basis of're very welcome to send me an email. And we are very ready for you to test this for the new standard. Not yet accredited because the standard does not exist, but I can promise you that day one when it's possible, we're going to opt in for accreditation for that test streak. So a little insert of my marketing in the podcast episode. But I think it's important that there is a basis of knowledge that exists based on experience. Actually, it is, again, very important to mention that we've got components, we've got kits, and we've got systems. We very rarely test real-scale PDS in the lab, but we have to verify what is the intended use and what is the intention of the lab tests. It is to assess and validate whether a specific combination of predefined components is capable to meet some design objectives. If it's not capable to do that in the lab, in the smaller scale, we can really doubt that it's going to work out in the real building. It's not capable to do that in the lab, in the smaller scale, we can really doubt that it's going to work out in the real building. It's not going to work. So this is one of the most complex and long-lasting discussions in the committee, because people tend to not understand what's the difference between key component and system. Once it is tested in the lab and it passes the tests, it can be installed in the building, more or less, you know, right? And then once it's installed in the building, it has to be tested again. This is not instead, this is additional tests to provide and to guarantee. I will tell you something funny that will not surprise you at all because you were involved in that, but we already have been testing kits that were designed for particular buildings undergoing refurbishment. When you have a new building, it's very, let's say, easy to engineer the system based on the existing market solutions for it. But when you have a 50-year-old skyscraper or 30-year-old skyscraper, you work with what's available in the building. You cannot go to the owner and tell them, okay, I need five new shafts in the core of the building. Or I need to test it for two weeks or a month in your building. Or I need to close the building and test it for two weeks. Yeah, exactly. So we've done that. We have been modifying the testing station to as closely as possible mock up the existing building and test the capabilities of the system as close to what's going to be in the real building in terms of leakages and stuff like that. The only thing that is very hard is the stack effect, obviously. But still, outside of stack effect, everything can be pretty much modeled on the rig. But still, outside of Stack Effect, everything can be pretty much modeled on the rig. So it's funny, we don't even have a standard published, and we've already went into performance-based engineering pathways with that. And I think this segues me to one of the questions I really wanted to ask you. In the beginning of the talk, you said that it's a kit. It contains pieces that you can use in buildings as necessary. I wonder, how do you determine what's going to be needed on the building? What type of engineering analysis did you pursue to design a system for a building? Or you just go to a catalog and pick a system for a 170-meter tall building? That would be cool, actually. Yeah, it's not that easy, but it works pretty much like this. Each and every time we have to start with design objectives, right? Architecture of the building, I mean, the height of the building and building parameters are just one group of input parameters for designing the PDS. We start with design objectives and we also define design pressure differences, desired air flows, and all the parameters which actually describe the PDS. So, and based on this database, we design PDS. But what I wanted to say is that we don't experiment with combinations of different components from one project to another. So today I'm working as an independent consultant for over two years. So, you know, I'm mostly based mostly on my experience. Because we had a chance to work on some tallest buildings in Poland. And also I had a chance to work on some projects in the Middle East. But so I work using my experience, practical experience, but it has to be calculated. At the design stage, you have to prove, and this is also one of the requirements of the new EN 1211 Part 13, that for buildings taller than 60 meters, you have to prove at the design or at the design concept stage, you have to prove that the system is capable, your PDS is capable to meet some specific design parameters. So there is a door open for CFD analysis, which are still not very common when we talk about PDS, because we model fire, we model spread of smoke, temperature differences, but we don't, in most of the cases, we don't do CFD for PDS. And I think this is a very good tool to prove at the design stage that the system works properly because the parameters of assessment of the PDS are very clearly defined. There is a specific pressure difference, there is a specific airflow, and that's more or less it. And this pressure difference corresponds to the opening force, which is actually critical in most of the cases when we talk about PDS, because we are not allowed actually to exceed 100 newtons in Europe and 133 newtons in the US. Maybe US guys are stronger than Europeans, or I don't know what's the reason for the difference, but we don't want to have pressure differences that result in exceeding 100 newtons of door opening force. And this is really the most important parameter. So just to put it all together, we want to have some specific pressure difference across the door and the fire floor. We want to have direct airflow from the protected space into the fire compartment to prevent smoke from coming in to the protected space. And we want to have the possibility to evacuate from the building, so we don't want to have any doors closed due to the exceeded door opening force. And with the CFD, I assume that you don't model just the compartment where the fire is taking place, or the floor. It's more like a simulation of the whole building. You model the stack effects and other effects involved? Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly. The best option would be to model the stack effects and other effects involved? Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly. The best option would be to model the entire building. This is not always possible because the models are getting bigger and bigger and it's very time consuming. So it depends how much potential and how much time you can spend. But at least we need to model a vertical escape route, which is protected, and representative floors in the building. And this is when we talk about the building, this is more or less it. And what about shafts? What about elevator shafts? Sure, definitely. We need to model all parts of the building which strongly influence the pressure distribution across the building. So like all the possible paths of the airplane. Exactly, exactly. You know, when we think about outside of the building, it is even more complex because we are dealing with dynamic changes of wind speed. And also the location of the building is important because it's located in downtown. We've got a variety of different tall buildings around the building. You know, it also influences the pressure distribution on building facade. But what is, from my point of view, what would be the most important thing, I'm not talking about the wind tunnel testing of some specific part of the city. I'm rather talking about pressure distribution on the building facade, because what is important for me, from my point of view, is the pressure difference between protected space and some reference space in the building, and to the outside, where there is an air release, for instance, at the building facade. Because when the facade is airtight and I don't open it for the means of PDS, so there is no particular need to model the outside of the building. So I can only limit the model to the building inside. Here is another point why mechanical exhaust would be maybe better than natural openings on the facade, because you would have the outlets at the roof level usually, or at the technical floor, which hopefully would be the same floor when you have inlets just maybe opposite sides of the building. But this simplifies both wind and both stack effect, because these effects will often even cancel out or not have that yeah that they can be compensated so so a good point and have you considered i know for american audience they are pretty much going like what the hell these guys are doing cfd for precious we have content for that and have you considered like simplified models to model that? Well actually they do more or less the same in Switzerland. It's even more common in Switzerland because especially around Zurich there is a canton Zurich they require they've got some local regulation. These are not even national regulations these are just canton regulations for some part of Switzerland where they require to do CFD, to do numerical analysis. Not necessarily CFD for the PDS, for buildings taller than 60 meters, and they are quite advanced. And they mostly use content for that. But this is definitely not the equivalent for the full-scale, I mean, fully advanced CFD, because this is about a kind of simplification of the nature of the real world. So I think it is somewhere in between. We do analytical calculations, hand calculations for the PDS all over the world. And for most of the cases, unfortunately, those hand calculations are limited to the capacity of the fan only, and to sizing the mechanical pressure relief temperature of the building, and that's it, which is way too less. I mean, which is way too little to assess the PDS in the real building. So we do it commonly like this. On the other hand, we've got CFD, advanced CFD simulations, which is the perfect way to, once it is carried out properly, this is another issue, but let's not go into too many details on that. The CFD is very good to analyze the processes when it comes to PDS in various buildings. Somewhere in between, we've got this TomTom, those own node models, right? So it is way better than hand calculations, but it is definitely not the CFD. I think I have to ask some experts and condom for the podcast. I have a few people in mind, maybe. Look forward towards the East. There will be an episode one day coming. What would be the difference? What's the advantage? The advantage is that even if you don't have very powerful computers, like you do, you've got a huge number of licenses, you've got big computers and stuff like that. So you've got all the required infrastructure to carry out advanced, big-scale, large-scale CFD simulations. In most of the cases, we have to limit the size of the model because we are not able to perform the fully advanced CFD simulations. So, Contam gives you the advantage that you can model entire building. Even outside the building, you can do some calculations. So, you don't need to have that much advanced computers for that. You can always outsource it to us. We'll handle it. We're cheap. Actually, I don't use ContTom. We're not cheap. I do hand calculations, so no worries. I will not outsource anything. The thing to take out of this episode, if you need help in engineering a system called Zagos, and I will go forward to do CFD for that. We'll do CFD for you, so you have a full package there. One last thing I wanted to ask you, because we've touched a little when talking about laboratory. So you said that laboratory tests are like prerequisite for that the system will work on the building. We know that if it, well, the fact that it works in lab does not mean it works in the building, but there's a good chance it will. If it doesn't work in the lab, then I'm sorry, it's not going to work anywhere. But when you go into a building, you've designed all this system, how do you prove it works? Yeah, actually there is a, let's say, testing procedure, real-scale testing procedure, commissioning of the PDS procedure described in EN 12.1 13, which gives you clear requirements on how to test it, you know, and what has to be measured and what is the required accuracy of the measured equipment. So it's relatively well described and it is quite easy to be carried out in the building. The only thing, it may be time consuming. Therefore, I'm 100% for active control systems, active control PDS, because I've got a chance, even if it's installed in the building, I've got a chance to recalibrate it, to reset it, to introduce different settings for different components. When we talk about mechanical solutions, which are predefined and pre-configured, for instance, on the production side, there is very little chance to change and to adjust anything in a building. And additionally, you touched on a point that I want to mention again, that in the lab, we do tests in relatively small scale. But what is the major problem in most of the cases when we talk about PDS? This is not necessarily the stairwellwell because the pressure distribution inside the building slowly depends on the temperature differences inside and inside. But the most important part, I mean the most critical part of the PDS turns out to be the firefighting lobby because we've got a relatively small room, I mean small space, right, where we supply quite a huge amount of air, right, and we open quite huge amount of air, right, and we open and close the door. And this is our interface between the air release path and the protected space, as you said at the beginning. The airlock, yes. The airlock. So it is the smaller the spaces and the more airtight the spaces and the more air we supply into this specific space, the harder to control pressure differences in this specific space because we've got huge pressure jumps when we close the door and we open the door and we have to increase capacity of the fan very fast. So it has to be very well controlled and very stable on the other hand. You can literally have hydraulic hits in the system, like the waves of pressure formed by closing the system. And we've seen that in lab kits that were jumping from this, actually, like literally jumping into the air because of the force that was in there. And that was not due to some miscalculations or wrong design. It was just because you're trying to put a lot of air into very small space, which is very airtight. And I agree, this is a challenge. This is a challenge. Therefore, you know, let's say standard PID controllers are perfect when we talk about, maybe perfect, when we talk about the stairwells and when we talk about firefighting fleets, which are relatively big and the airtightness of those spaces is relatively low. But when we talk about the lobbies, which are small, probably small, I would even say tiny, so we need to have something more advanced when we talk about controls. The PAD controller has this characteristic that the faster it operates, the less stable it becomes, and opposite, right? So it is not possible to configure it properly. So for firefighting clubbies, we've got the option to use more advanced control systems and actuators for the system, I mean the control devices, or to go for, let's say, more or less constant capacity BDS, regardless of the position of the evacuation door, whether it's open or closed. So I'd like to say that from my point of view, based on my experience, when something is advanced, it doesn't necessarily have to be very complex. It also can be relatively simple. The architecture of the system can be relatively simple and understandable from my point of view. But, for instance, when we use electronically controlled components, it is a matter of reliability of the system, right? So in the systems I recommend and design, all electronic components are continuously monitored. We cannot be sure that the system will work properly or not unless we don't monitor the entire system continuously. This is not like we will start the system once per year during the periodic testing of the PDS. We need to be sure that it will operate more or less throughout the entire year. So in the systems we developed, for instance, it normally goes through routine testing. It is a self-testing system. So, for instance, air supply fan is being started once per day with a very low capacity, not to interfere with the use of the building. And we also open and close mechanical shuttle damper. This procedure we do in the laboratory also forces our clients to think about some sort of leakage compensation approach. What I mean is that during the tests we sometimes change the leakages a little bit, not a whole lot, but a little bit because in the building it's enough that someone puts a carpet in a corridor to change the leakages. And we don't want to have a system that works only fine-tuned to a particular leakage and when the leakages change a little bit it goes into oscillations or something. So usually clients have to develop some sort of systems that every now and then test the leakages and adjust the parameters of the PID controllers to match the thing they see in the building. And Grzegorz, well, MFly is great when you're having fun. You said it's a boring topic and we're going to wrap it in 30 minutes. An hour has passed and we could talk for another one, but I will stop you there. But I will give you a chance for like a final statement. If you have a message to our friends outside of the Poland who want to design safe PDS systems outside of calling you and me, what should they do? I do. You know, please do not believe that PDS in general don't work because they are PDS. They don't work because it's our fault when they don't work, actually, you know, because this is, in most of the cases, this is a result of bad design or bad quality of components. So the overall idea is good from my point of view. And if it's properly designed, it has a chance to be very useful in terms of saving people's life and supporting firefighters on site. So besides, I don't see any alternative for the time being to replace PDS with anything else. We've got two ways to design good PDS or to design bad PDS. So I'm definitely for designing good ones. And I think it doesn't have to be very complex and very hard task to do. And we have to keep in mind that we've got different buildings and each and every time PDS has to be tailor-made to the building. So when we talk about simple projects, let's not go into CFD analysis, let's not go into some advanced, some complex systems, let's use what we normally use. But when we talk about buildings taller than, let's say, 100 meters in harsh climate, I mean, climatic zones in parts of the world when it's cold outside and when it can be very warm outside, let's don't underestimate problems with BDS. And let's not copy. If we have a building which is 30 meters tall, let's say, let's not multiply PDS into 150 meters by simply copy-paste because it will not work. So each and every time we have to think reasonably and we have to behave in a, let's say, smart way to use and to design and to use the smart PDS. And the PDS will never be smarter than us, so it's our responsibility. The PDS cannot compensate for the stupidity of its creators. Exactly. That's a brutal final remark, but yeah, we are engineers. Let's engineer. Thank you, Grzegorz, for this talk and let's stay in touch and I hope to work with you on many, many PDS projects around the world. Thank you very much. Thanks, man.
