 Hello and welcome to Firescience Show Session 51. Last week was the celebrations. It was such a great pleasure to celebrate Episode 50. We had a great song. It was really a lot of fun for me. So thank you very much to everyone who participated and thanks to Matt and Guillermo, especially for their significant contributions. And now we're going back to the normal routine, which is hardcore fire science without dumping it down. For today's episode, I actually brought a firefighter to the show, fire instructor and someone who is actually quite passionate about fire science as well. His name is Szymon Kokot. He's a chief officer of Nidzica Polish State Fire Service Department. And he's also Chief of a foundation, CFBT, which is dedicated to training firefighters in Poland. So without a doubt, he's passionate about fire service and helping communities. Szymon also happens to be a doctoral student at the Main School of Fire Service, He also happens to be a doctoral student at the Main School of Fire Service where he's pursuing his PhD on thermal exposures to firefighters. And I think it's a very, very interesting subject. I'm going to have an episode about that soon-ish. But because of his exposure to fire science, I think he quite well grasps the necessity of fire science to firefighters. And that is the first thing we're going to discuss about in today's episode. The second thing is the exposure of fire engineers to firefighters. That is something I don't think we have enough. I don't think we as fire engineers appreciate the job of a firefighter enough. I don't think we understand completely what they are doing, what they want to achieve, what are their tools and how they use them. So I think it's a huge gap to be filled by projects like this podcast to connect our groups together, because together we can achieve much much more and if you ever wondered how firefighting operations look what are the first thoughts in the head of experienced fire officer when you ask them what was happening when they arrived to the spot you will be surprised i was surprised and it's eye-opening what really they care about and what they seem to not care that much about. These pressure points are quite different from what I've been taught as a fire safety engineer. So definitely an episode worth listening to the end. I hope you'll enjoy it and let's not plonk this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, I'm today with a good friend, Szymon Kokos of the Polish Fire Brigade and CFBT Poland Foundation. Great to have you in the podcast, Szymon. Hi, Wojciech, and it's a real pleasure to be on your podcast. I'm a big fan. And straight, I will say one thing. You have to leave a five-star review for this podcast because it's absolutely fantastic. It's not possible to leave lower stars. The software will not take it. It's a smart software. Thank you, Shimon. And we can say welcome to the podcast again because you had a small appearance in the What The Mist conference, you had a small appearance in the Watermist Conference, which was an interesting event. And I really enjoyed how you talked about the firefighter in the room that's already there, meaning the Sprinkler system. And today, you know, I do this podcast for fire engineers, for fire scientists. I hope there's a lot of firefighters and other professionals that deal with fire in some way listening to us. And often we as fire engineers, we do a lot of stuff thinking about firefighters and to help firefighters, to assist firefighters, to change the environment in which firefighters work. But I think we don't have great appreciation of how that work looks like, what the challenges are, and what really means to battle fires. I'm quite lucky I did the main school fire service in Warsaw as a civilian. However, I was still exposed to a lot of training meant for officers. You know, you did the same course, but for officers in that school. So you know what I mean. But I feel that in many places of the world, the fire engineers would come outside of the fire engineering. They would come from mechanical or architectural or structural engineering, become a fire engineer. So they have absolutely no idea how the job looks from the firefighter's perspective. And first, I wanted to ask you, where do you see the biggest gaps in communication or knowledge? Is there a quick way we could improve that? Because I feel it's a critical component. Well, I'm not sure if there's a quick way. And if there is, I'm not sure I fully understand and appreciate how it can be done. But like you said, I graduated from the main school of fire service, first engineer, then master's engineer. I'm also doing my PhD still under the main school of fire service. It's on thermal radiation. So I am a fire safety engineer myself, although I understand and I understood from the very beginning that within this specialization, you can also identify a number of, let's say, sub-specializations. So there's command, obviously, there's prevention, there's a lot to know about design and prevention and so on. So I'm more on the side of command, let's say, of intervention. Still, my understanding is that there is no theory without practice and there isn't a practice without theory. So even if we consider ourselves to be more practical guys in the scope of the fire engineering. By saying this, we automatically devoid ourselves of a very important component, which is a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations. So many years after graduating, I'm still reading books. I'm still trying to, you know, catch up with all the things that are going on in the world. A great example is what UL or currently Fire Safety Research Institute is doing by providing research that is dedicated for firefighters. So I think that firefighters basically need to understand that if they want to be really good or a best version of themselves as firefighters, fire commanders, they need to really have a very strong theoretical basis, which I suppose is lacking these days. I love how you said that there are many fields and command is one, obviously, because for me, it's not an obvious thing, you know, and I think many fire safety engineers would not, it would not be an immediate choice. You know, the firefighter is this guy with water who comes in and sprays water. We don't really appreciate the diversity, the logistics behind it, the knowledge and skills around it. And yet we try to push for solutions that are meant to help in that work. That is exactly what I meant with this lack of appreciation between our groups. Maybe it's just we don't talk to each other enough. Maybe it's some other reasons I don't necessarily understand. Why would we not share engineers to firefighters, firefighters to engineers? I actually think that is critical to talk with firefighters. It is. Yeah. It is. I will share with you, there's a saying which maybe you have heard or the audience have heard, put the wet stuff on the red stuff. It's the display of the philosophy that is often connected to the firefighting, but it's way more complicated than that because the wet stuff being water is something with cooling capacity. That's what we need to understand. And the red stuff is something that produces heat. Now, the heat is dependent on the access of air or the gas exchange. The effectiveness of water is basically connected to your proximity to the fire. So if you're closer, you can obviously apply water in a more efficient way. But still, if you want to get closer, you are endangering your people. You are committing them into smoke. You have to calculate the time. Then you have something that you flow and you have to supply. So these are measurements or sometimes assessments of your water supply and so on and so on. of your water supply and so on and so on. So it's a complicated world, which in addition has to be played. This whole theater happens within seconds very often. And then whatever you decide can dictate the outcome of your entire two, three, four hour intervention. So, yeah. It's interesting because when we consider like fire dynamics in a compartment or in general fire development in a building, So, yeah. sprays and everything around. In the eyes of the firefighter and fire instructor, I think, in the first place, how do you view the fire science? From your perspective, does fire science even exist? Is it useful? What is young firefighter reading to learn about this? It's funny you're asking this. Currently, he's reading my book. Fantastic. Thanks. I wrote a textbook on structural firefighting for the fire service. It is approved by the National Fire Chief as a textbook for firefighting. Years before, I worked on, together with international colleagues and best Polish instructors, I worked on the development of the curriculum. Then we designed training infrastructure, then we produced instructors, and then we produced training materials. Still, there's some milestones to be reached, but how does the science exist? Honestly, after many years, I will say that there isn't firefighting without science. I mean, because often it's translated into simple terms, and the lower you go in the ranks, obviously you need to make more simple procedures or algorithms for people. If there's none of that, if you want to be safe, close the door or whatever this kind of, or limit the inflow. Then you can complicate the idea further. Only a certain level of complication is necessary for understanding, but it's a very good exercise, a very eye-opening exercise and horizon-broadening exercise for the commanders to actually know their science because because it it governs everything yeah i i have a very strong opinion that there isn't firefighting without science it has to it has to simply has to be the foundation of even the simplest or most basic firefighting actions but at the the same time, it must be accessible. Like you've said, there are certain levels which would probably come with the experience and formal training. Yes. That you can go deeper and deeper into it, but it doesn't matter. Even the rookie, a voluntary firefighter should know fire science. It's just, it's the difficult job to present that fire science to them in a way they can comprehend, given their current experience, knowledge, and let's say, formal training status, right? That's the challenge. That is true. So so therefore not everybody can be a good instructor or a good teacher that's the first thing but there's another branch of science or knowledge maybe it's a better word or maybe it's science which is called pedagogics um there is a science of teaching and there's a science of learning as well so for example i'm a graduate of pedagogical studies uh occupational health and safety studies. Plus, I like people. So probably also that I have the gift of the gab, or I talk a lot, or I pour water, as we say in Polish. But instructional design is critical because I can give complex books to firefighters and say, you know, in two weeks I'm going to give you a test and you have to pass it to become firefighter. But instead, I prefer to create their interest in firefighting because fire is a phenomenon that was with the humankind ever since we started being a little bit more organized. So we started living in caves and and used fire to quit eating raw meat or so that was always something hypnotizing connected with safety connect paradoxically with safety of household and with warmth and being close to let's say your tribe sort of so that's why people are still fascinated in fire. And, for example, this is one thing that we use in the pedagogics of teaching fire science to recruits. I had this issue last year when there was this moment where Professor Koniecki has passed away in Poland. He was my PhD supervisor and one of my mentors. I mean, he was the compartment fire dynamics guy. Fantastic person. Really missing him. But this opened a hole in the curriculum of the university because he was giving compartment fire dynamics. And he passed suddenly. So the course had to continue. And I was very honored that I was asked to finish it with the students. And it was just a short chapter in my career, not an academic, but I've met this 100 or 200 young people trying to learn being fire safety engineers. And I have a choice. Either I drop, you know, hundreds of pages of equations on them, which I possibly could to show them the theoretical foundations. Or I can just try to explain them how small changes in the compartment change the outcomes of the fire and that you can actually, we have tools and models to calculate that. Like you open the door, the pressure plane changes. You put a wind boundary condition on your window, the flow path changes. You change the size of the compartment, your temperature will change in the compartment. You have compartment big enough, the fire will travel. Things like that. And they were fascinated. And it seemed that they really enjoyed this view of science. And it was not a dumbed down science. It's not the case. It was just put in a simpler terms that are digestible and easy to comprehend. And in this form, I thought that they really benefit from my curse. Obviously, Professor Koneski had the gift and he was able to do the equations together with inspiring. And that's something I would eventually one day maybe achieve. I would aspire to that. But I thought that it is important to do it like that because there was no point to push equations into their heads. It's interesting that you're saying that because just a minute ago, I thought about this very sentence, dumbing down. And this is a sentence that I heard from John McDonough, who is one of the most recognized worldwide instructors of CFBT. By the way, I will elaborate on the abbreviation or the acronym in a few moments as well. And he used to say, stop damning firefighters down. I understand that this is science, but come on, we are people. We have mastered civilization. It's amazing, you know, just from private life. I took a loan today and me and my wife, we went with our dogs, you know, and I always laugh to the dog. Can you open the door? No, the dog cannot open the door. Can you bring out the trash? No, the dog cannot bring out the trash. Not to mention about recycling. No, we are a civilized kind. We need to aspire, not aspire down. We need to aspire up. I mean, people are smart. Everybody is able to understand the triangle. You don't need to dump down things. Yeah, the triangle of fire or the tetrahedron, as the Americans say, or if you mix these elements, there will be fire. Now, this is complex enough. This is actually simple, but you don't need to make it more complex for the firefighter who is starting their, let's say, adventure with firefighting and is working on the nozzle. He or she, they need to understand, okay, do not add too much air. Try to be in the safe zone. If you feel the heat, it's probably a little bit too late so watch the signs because your ear works as a capacitor it gathers heat and when you feel it it's it's a bit too late i mean it's now we have too good ppe so everything is science i mean the pp is so scientific there's this layer that doesn't burn. There's this layer that does not allow water in while letting your sweat out, you know, as vapor. And there's this layer that just makes you comfortable that can get wet. And there's some resistance for this HTI or whatever thing from the standard that is saying how much resistance there is against water vapor. It translates into comfort of working but everything is is basically advanced material science of fire science of combustion science of water and so on hydraulics the water delivery to fire it's science bernoulli's equation i mean it's absolutely basic stuff to understand okay let's spin the table a little bit. All right. So let's now try to expose some fire engineers to Firefighters 101 without dumping it down. And you once said that whatever people made, it will burn down and they don't design it for burning. But from your perspective, you have to be ready that it will. Exactly. Yeah. In the green room, we've chatted a little bit about it. Sometimes we as engineers, we would stop our calculation and say, okay, this is a very improbable fire. For you who have to go and then quench it down, it's not a great news that you have encountered a very, very rare fire in your life. No, it's on the contrary. It's bad news. I don't have experience. You have to fight it. But I really, like, if you could explain to engineers, like, what happens when firefighters arrive? Because I think people don't really comprehend that well. Let's pick an object, maybe a car park. You like car parks? You love car parks. Yeah, yeah. a car park. You like car parks? You love car parks. Yeah, I love them. Everyone loves car parks. Underground, multi-level car parks. Especially, yeah, okay, let's make it. Actually, let's make it a multi-level underground car park. So from my perspective, when I'm engineering this, I would assume some design fire, which grows in the car park. I would design some design fire, which grows in the car park. I would design some smoke control systems to create a state of equilibrium inside the car park that it is produced, it is removed, sometimes to various levels of success in making the car park smoke-free. Actually, it's never smoke-free. It's always filled with smoke to some extent. It's never smoke-free. It's always filled with smoke to some extent. But 15 minutes into my analysis, I assume some firefighters show up, and for me, the job is done. It's their problem now. And from you, when you arrive, what's happening? Okay, so going back shortly to the motto, I used to say that nobody designs anything with the intention that it will certainly, without a doubt, be on fire. While we know that anything that humankind has produced will sooner or later be on fire and we will have to intervene. By saying this, I don't mean that everything always catches fire, but there isn't basically, okay, for the prevention officers, surely, but for the intervention firefighters, there isn't a world of interest outside the reality of, so whatever is designed, manufactured will be only professionally of interest for us when there's problems with it. So let's say we are the testing community of all the problems, you know, that can be created. I must stop you because you brought before. He didn't answer my car park question, but you gave. I'm getting there. I'm getting there. Yeah, we'll get to a car park. But I think you've touched in the meantime, you have touched something really, really good that for you guys, it's always burning. It's like you don't get an intervention in a non-burning building. For us, a building that burns is a rare thing and low probability even for you is Wednesday. That's exactly the thing. And I think this is also a reason why in the end fire engineers and firefighters end up having completely different views on the fire, what fire is, how much money you should save while designing fire safety in the building. I mean, it's so rare. Yeah. But it also works on your side. It also skews up the view because for you, the fires are common. They are always there in a way, whereas in fact, they are rare. Exactly. But in a way, because I totally appreciate the work that is being done by fire engineers, because otherwise we would be really screwed. And I really appreciate that because if there was no quality control, safety features built in, fail-safe mechanisms and so on, the world would be a disaster. We would need probably half of the population to be firefighters or some kind of first responders, you know. So absolutely great respect for all the work that is being done. I think that there is a great need for the communities to work more closely together to understand both sides. Because it was absolutely enlightening to hear about risk probability in your previous episodes from different great people whom I admire vastly, like Professor Ezekiel or the guys who spoke about battery fires, wooden buildings, and so on. I have to admit, I haven't listened to all of them, but you're just producing these episodes too fast, and that's why you really not only deserve but I demand that you get a five-star review on the podcast app from every listener right now. That is an order. I will remind them. That's the commander way. Okay, let's go to the car park. Let's tell the fire engineers what the firefighter does when they get a call that the car let's go to the car park let's tell let's tell the fire engineers what the firefighter does when they when they get a call that the car park is on fire and it's underground you already agreed that okay multi-level underground car park so so based on experience there is a pda pre-determined attendance that's probably a very british term like a minimum of vehicles and personnel that absolutely has to be dispatched to this kind of event as a minimum first, let's say, serving. And then when the commander is on scene, he or she will decide if it's enough or will they need more. Now, this decision is based on multiple factors. If this is a building that was in the area for some time, there is an increased chance that they know the layout of the building. If it's a new one, maybe there was just one visit or maybe there was no exercise yet. We have operational planning that envisages going to all major or complex buildings, you know, frequently or at least try to put them on the list and check them one after another, because it's a maze. The problem, like when I sometimes teach the firefighters in the factory, I tell them the difference. You know what is your advantage? You know the buildings. You know exactly the buildings. So next time you just are walking around, you know, eating your donut, chatting with your friend, just have a look around. This is your great advantage. When we are attending a fire, we basically don't know where we are going. That's one thing. The second thing we take into consideration, what is the time of the day? If it's evening till morning, the car park is mostly full. If it's the other part of the day, it's mostly empty. So fire load. Fire load, but also the ability or the easiness to travel around it without being disoriented. Because obviously you have to throw in limited visibility. If it's limited visibility, it's smoke. If it's smoke, it's smoke if it's smoke it means breathing protection breathing protection has limited time so depending on also depending on another let's say science which is ergonomics you have to be able to assess it's not entirely the case of the fire commander because every firefighter has to know this for themselves how much air they are using is it 50 60 70 80 liters per minute based on different types of work, moderate work, heavy work, or so on? Or more practically, they have to just read the gauge of their BA pressure frequently enough and be able to communicate. If we want to communicate, there's a problem with concrete floors, which blocks the signal. So there's a number of difficulties. the signal. So there's a number of difficulties. What is the average ability of firefighter to combat fire, be it cool smoke, be it attack the seat of the fire? And if I'm having today an average firefighter, a very good firefighter or a poor firefighter, it's a great set of variables. So there's many levels of constraints you have to take into account. The time, like you can send people for a certain amount of time until their breathing apparatus stops working and probably you need to secure the logistics, how to exchange them. Pull them out early enough so that they don't work. Yeah, they don't work on the reserve, because it's basically being in the danger zone, working on the reserve, but also being able to send in someone in exchange so that we have a continuous firefighting operation. You mentioned communication, which also can be blocked by the building itself. It can. Then visibility. Do I have thermal imaging cameras? Now, that's a piece of scientific equipment, you know, like reading thermal radiation from emitting objects. Which, by the way, is also they need to understand this is not a thermometer. This is an assessment. If it's heavy smoke, there's a lot of soot. You will not be able to see through it. So your camera is not broken. It's just basically... It's reading what's reading. It's reading the physics. It's just the physics that's not really in your favor. And what about water? You need water. How complicated is water logistics? I know from school it's not easy. No, it's not easy. And here I have a great mentor who is Paul Grimwood, who is a fantastic gentleman, a gentleman, and I mean it by saying this, but he dedicated his life to developing science of water. So in his PhD, which he defended probably in 2015, he identified the relation between early applied high flow rates of firefighting water to limited area destroyed by fire. The limited time of work that is also the limited exposure to heat, the limited engine work time, and so on and so on. Basically, if you apply good enough water in the beginning, everything gets, that's also a simplification. Everything gets more simple, but you need to be able to organize it. So first of all, the predetermined attendance, what is the dispatch that you are receiving, but soon enough, you have to understand that whatever you are applying, you need to balance by organizing some form of water supply. In urban areas, that's usually hydrants. And in most cases, maybe unless there's 17 fire stations plus the school, to Nidzica, where I serve, where there's one fire station plus not so many voluntary fire brigades, which are usually not available entirely during daytime because people are at work. So there's huge differences. But also, if you don't put enough effort into training firefighters, But also, if you don't put enough effort into training of firefighters, their effectiveness of firefighting can be as different as between 10% and 100%, which is tenfold. Now, if you are interested in any kind of assessment of risk or efficiency, a tenfold difference is like worlds apart. So training is crucial. We have to train people. And again, we really need to feed them with science because otherwise they don't understand why they are doing things. And it's been in 1866, I think, that James Braidwood, the first commander of a metropolitan fire brigade in Edinburgh, he wrote a book where he explicitly mentioned that he's not only teaching guys what to do and how to do, but first of all, why they are doing this. Because if they understand why, they will find what and how. I have another one to go deeper on this conversation on the firefighting work, the fire. To what extent the work would be different when the building is different? Let's imagine you have a taller building, you have a deeper car park. We had these conversations, especially related to timber in fire, where we eventually concluded that the building must be, the fire must be put out at some point. And we all intuitively think, feel that if you have a two-story building, that's a completely different fire to attend than a fire on the top of a 30-story building. Oh, absolutely. And to what extent does difficulties for you rise with the increase of complexity of the building? Is it twice harder or ten times harder? It's not easy to, let's say, put it in simple terms like this, but I can elaborate a little bit. There's a great friend that I have whose name is John Chubb, and he's a fire officer, operationally training fire officer in Dublin, Fire Brigade, Ireland. Probably 36 or 37 years of service, very, very knowledgeable, very experienced, very humble person, a great mentor for me. And he's established a fantastic program on, let's say, fighting fires. In the beginning, let's say the intention was in tall buildings or high-rise buildings, but he sort of broadened it to complex buildings because the buildings does not have to necessarily be tall. It can be huge, have a huge floor plan, and it's already a difference. For us, the time or the effort that we need to dedicate to travel from the arrival spot to the spot where we can start operating it doesn't have to be up but up is more difficult because also water doesn't travel up well if it's far then we get kinks and bends in the hose lines this is the pressure loss then we end up with less flow transportation on on foot of the equipment, which is usually heavy. I mean, modern firefighting gear is 20 plus kilograms. And while protecting from heat, it also protects you from cooling down by sweating. So there are studies, including ULFSRI, but also with other organizations or institutions from U.S. that identified that if you are doing simple things in your turnout gear, you tend to overheat. You don't necessarily have to be in hot gases. It is by minimizing your ability to sweat effectively because you're covered with a number of layers of your gear. So if you make this longer before you're actually able to start your firefighting effectively, firefighting operation, that means you get more fatigued. There's an average saying that if your firefighter travels 18 stories up, they need a major rest before they can undertake any other operation. So perhaps you can translate that to another kind of distance, not necessarily vertical, but horizontal, or instead of that, you get a similar energetic effort by having to carry more weight over a shorter distance of time. But basically a couple minutes of strain let's say or really intensive physical activity really devoids you of majority of your strength and imagine this is how you feel when you finish like a one kilometer race and exactly this is when your task is to enter a burning compartment and rescue people you This is when your job starts. You just arrived. It actually starts. You just arrived, but then you traveled. You got your ass kicked by the gear that you are carrying, and then only then you have to do this. So another branch of science, which is ergonomics or human physiology, we have to understand as commanders that if we work our people too hard, there will be no effect. And also we can create a problem for ourselves, where one firefighter is suffering from, let's say, some kind of health problems. Recently, I had a twisted knee. The guy was not only not able to help in the intervention, but he needed assistance of another firefighter, because at that time, there were no ambulances available and from the pain he was losing his consciousness his oxygen saturation was going down so not only i didn't have one firefighter but i didn't have another in my very limited staffing i did not have another who attended to the first one and also in the heads of the remaining ones there was a ringing bell something happened to our colleague. We are human beings, you know, stress attacks us, whether we are trained or not. It makes sense what we all intuitively feel, that the larger the building, the taller the building, the more capable it should be sustaining itself from the fire. Yes. Oh, yes. sustaining itself from the fire. Oh, yes. I understand if you have a super tall building, like really tall, like 200 meters tall, there is very limited stuff you can do in that building. Like, okay, if you have a firefighter's elevator, you probably can enter the top floor, but still you're limited with the amount of gear you can transport. You're limited to the building supporting you with water. You're limited to the building safeguarding your entrance point to a compartment through the ventilated lobby or something. So, truly, a lot is on the building, you know, to survive the fire and not only survive, but also to limit the damage and the loss of casualties. So, here I go again to my motto, nobody builds nothing with the certainty it will catch fire. I mean, nobody wants it. That's for me understood. But nobody really thinks about firefighters. We're not a major group of people. So I have this very sad and pessimistic saying, we have no allies. Well, actually, we do have a little bit of allies in the construction world. You mentioned a very interesting case of a toll building. In toll building, you have to always consider the wind. Always. Because it's always a factor. In toll building, you have probably greater probability of encountering open plan. So a traveling fire instead of compartment fire, starting from one to another. When you use the elevator, because sometimes you can, you have to account for the piston effect. I mean, it's a vertical shaft going throughout the entire building. If you start moving your whatever is called, like a piston, I think, you will either suck in the smoke or push out the smoke. So you can only travel a number of floors at the time, like two, three, and see what's going on. So, yes, totally, I would prefer if I could blindly trust that the building is going to behave. Well, is it going to behave? I'm not sure. So we always leave a margin for, let's say, unexpected or maybe we should not call unexpected. Not according to the scenario. We should be expecting anything, even the less probable things. But also the building should not be too complex so that we can, let's say, operate the features of the building. So like heating, ventilation and AC systems should not get in our way or should be easily overdriven by the fire commander in the lobby so that we don't get unexpected opening of the window behind the firefighters while wind is blowing into the window on the opposite side because then we create the blowtorch effect and so on. So yeah, I mean, complex buildings are really a challenge for us. Do you think the commander... You mentioned a very complex building. Do you think the commander is fit to comprehend the building? I think a lot of work has to be done before the fire. If you're a commander, you should know your region, you should know your buildings. I know I am involved in commissioning buildings. I am there when we are delivering the end of the fire safety projects. We're starting up the smoke control, we're starting up fire detection. I know how complicated these things are. And even though I work at the design phase, it takes me quite a good time to get familiar with the particular system design in this building, delivered in this building. It's not like on-off button. It's a complicated control panel with very confusing names on it. And sometimes the commander may have quite a difficult time. Maybe it's a thing where we as engineers could improve instead of designing more fancy systems, design systems that are more approachable, more easy to operate, easier to understand. That would be a thing. If you could, that would be wonderful. I was not aware that we can have such a fancy wish. But look, you're asking me if the commander is ready. Well, I can certainly say that the institution has all the features necessary to make it happen, but there's a fluctuation or what's it called, like exchange of personnel happening. A given commander, by chance, by simple fate, is currently on duty when something major happens. And he or she may not be entirely understanding of what's going on and what needs to be done. There is certainly such a possibility. So if we could either connect the worlds, and as you say, you commissioned the building. Normally, you have a prevention officer on site. Rarely on this stage, probably you have operational commanders. If they are there, there's one person or two people or three. While there's a whole battalion of firefighters that actually will engage in firefighting in that building. But then it's on our side, how we how we create our training and also what we say, maintenance of competencies or lifelong education. And for us, the fire engineers, like from your perspective, which parts of what we design are the most important, like compartmentation, suppression, detection, ventilation, probably all are important. But how do you view these tools? Because we often are burdened with designing these systems so they help firefighters. I don't know how they would help. So how can I design that? Yeah. I mean, for us, it would be most beneficial if the building behaved like it should. So compartmentation. By saying this, I do not only mean walls, but also let's say windows on upper floors. That's one thing. Secondly, because we know that it's not a switch anymore. It's done. We only have synthetic fuels inside buildings. So there's great heat release. But as we know from the Thornton's law, which is over 100 years old, the amount of heat is relative to the oxygen that is provided to the combustion process. So we would like to be able to trust entirely, entirely. I mean, like blindly trust that the building will behave. And also that some of the features that are designed will not cause any surprise. So, for example, the HVAC systems will not start opening, you know, the building up. So because what I understand, I mean, my look at the evacuation is currently as such. We will do anything with the building that will aid evacuation, even if it means that the building will be lost. If we rescue all the people but lose the building, it is still a good outcome. Therefore, we will open up a lot in the early phase, because in the early phase is where the people get out, so we don't want to obscure their evacuation routes. But for firefighters, appearing soon on the scene, it creates another problem. It's a well-ventilated fire. When we start closing it down, the amount of heat that was produced will start creating pyrolysis gases, which will obscure, which will travel, which can cause violent or very dynamic fire phenomena and so on. Well, that's okay. At the cost of saving people, that's okay if we lose the building. Or by the benefit of saving people, we can lose the building. But we would like to have the ability of then have a full entire control over the building. The problem is that we're also human beings. If the building is, as you mentioned, 200 meters tall, it has like sections, floors, whatever other kind of stuff. Maybe it's sometimes too complex to just grasp it with your mind. And then while keeping in mind the air, the water, wherever your people are committed, what's your communication, you know, wherever your people are committed, what's your communication. You know, the press officer is calling. That's not bad if your fire chief is calling. That's another stressor and so on and so on. You know, the public is going. Maybe you need to remove the public or the glass is starting falling. I mean, all sorts of things can happen. I had a fire recently where there was a flat tire. There was a twisted ankle, there was lack of ambulances. I couldn't find police to block the road. There was a collision because of that. And I said, oh, oh my goodness. I mean, I feel like in Egypt where there were the plagues, you know, first the frogs, then the whatever. I don't even remember what they were, but it was like epic, epic, you know, series of mishappenings. And it was a great test for me. It was a great test for me. We rescued people's property. What burned down was the abandoned building. So I immediately said, I'm surrendering this. We need to switch and go and protect because there was the wind was blowing really, blowing really sideways. If there was rain, it would be falling not vertically but horizontally. There was such a wind. And the grass was dry and it was a very poorly maintained area with lots of wild dry vegetation, some heaps of trash and so on. And then immediately after after there was residential buildings which were threatened by the fire. Hey, Szymon, it's sad, but we have to wrap it up. All right. So maybe you have some sort of a message to the fire engineers and from a firefighter, like how can we best help you? Or maybe you have a message to firefighters to learn more fire science. What do you choose? Yeah yeah i just made two points i will i would love to be able to very briefly touch on them one is that we are called cfbt which was historically because of the english term that was used for firefighters teaching other firefighters how to fight fires. It was called compartment fire behavior training. We recently started calling ourselves CFBT, but critical fire behavior training. There's a lot more to learn about fire than just the compartment. So to my firefighters, every firefighter, my message is do not limit your point of view to a compartment. A fire is a way more complex phenomena or undertaking that you would be encountered with. And second thing is, I was, I am, I was, I was part of the events. I feel like a part of this group, which is called IFIW, the International Fire Instructors Workshop. It was started by Stefan Svensson, Professor Svensson, whom I admire greatly, and I have the great privilege to call him my friend. And he decided in 2008 that he will bring together scientists and practitioners. And out of that, there was created a great, let's say, movement of firefighters wanting to know more about science and scientists wanting to know more about practice. We had Steve Kerber attending, Ed Hartin, Paul Grimwood, Sean Raphael, John McDonough, Michael Reich, the creator of the smoke curtain. He's a great guy to invite to your podcast. He's a PhD on fire science, and he's the creator of the portable device used by firefighters. And I would love to see more discussion between the two sides, because actually the reality is in the middle. It's on neither side. And if, yeah, basically there was another thought, but I really talked too much. So I think we need to understand how to help firefighters. And we're also in this difficult place where many of our decisions must be communicated to stakeholders, like eventually someone has to pay for them for all the solutions. So understanding how we help firefighters or how our business affects your business, which is our business too, it helps us, you know, be an advocate for some things that can really help build safety. And I think this mutual understanding is beneficial to both parties and is essential to eventually have something we could call a fire safe world. And I hope we can achieve that one day. Yeah, and Wojciech, there's a great example of you and me working together because you're opening a possibility for me to join your research and conduct some of my own experiments for my own PhD. My concern is firefighter safety, the effect of thermal radiation on firefighters, which I'm sincerely hoping to achieve this year with your tremendous help, critical help, because you're providing me with the possibility of doing this in your facilities. So I think this is the way to go. And for every firefighter, if they want to really develop as a professional, sooner or later they have to engage in the vast ocean of scientific knowledge. There isn't another way. have to engage in the vast ocean of scientific knowledge. There isn't another way. And we're very happy to learn from you about the compartment fires and corridor firefighting tactics, which will greatly enhance our experiments. There's a great synergy. Let's do it. Once it's done, you'll be back here in the seat and we'll talk it over in the podcast as well. Simon, thank you very much for your time. Keep doing what you're doing. It's great and much appreciated. Thanks. See you around, man. This is a great honor for me. I really enjoy being here after all these great minds and probably also before these great minds. And I will just say one more thing. Five-star review, please. Thanks, man. You're amazing. I need to get you more in here. You're really good in this. Yeah, well, provided if it works, I'm happy to be there often, you know? Okay, thanks, man. Cheers, man. Cheers. And that's it. Thank you, Shimon. I hope you also left a five-star review. Man, it's so funny when your guests do their job for you and it's kind of awkward sometimes to do this call for action so yeah appreciate that shimon did it twice i expected tsunami of five star reviews for the podcast after this episode airs regardless i hope this was interesting to you i hope it was eye-opening to you have you figured out what are his first thoughts commands air supply ergon, how far can one walk? This is something I've never really thought when designing building. It was not just things that would occupy my mind. I mean, we're not thought that. And I think it's important to know. It's not that we can design the building so they have lesser distances for walking or that we provide them breathing apertures on the side. It's not the point. The point is, it truly is that challenge is exponentially higher when the building is large. And the second thing that you notice, he didn't say tall, he said large. It doesn't matter if the building is not very tall when horizontal distances are so vast. And that's another thing. We regulate usually based on the number of floors or the height of the building. And for some certain heights, we don't care that much. For some heights, we do care a lot. And then we have this landscaper type of buildings, which are generally huge complex mazes in which operations will be difficult i think this ramp up of difficulty is something we really need to consider when designing safety of the building there's no way around that and thank you that was very refreshing to me and I hope we can go further with that because I think we're on a great path to create a sustainable world of communication between the firefighters and fire engineers. And I would really like this podcast to become a venue where such a communication can safely occur. And I think that's it for today's episode. I hope you've enjoyed it. And like Shimon said, a five-star review. He's a commander, you know, don't mess with him. But no worry. I appreciate you all for just listening and being here with me every week. And I hope to see you here next week, another Wednesday, another great episode. See you there. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
