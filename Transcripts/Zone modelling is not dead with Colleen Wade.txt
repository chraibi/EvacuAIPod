 So, one week ago, I took you into a trip to the future with Xinyuan Huang, who shown us the possibility of using AI in fire science and technology. And today, I'm going to take you a little bit back to the past, to the golden age of fire safety, when some of the most magnificent tools were created. And one of these tools is definitely a zone model. And one of these tools is definitely a zone model. I personally rank the development of compartment fire modeling and zone models as a computational counterpart of that theory, as one of the biggest achievements of the fire science ever, which opened the doors to developing new practical solutions. Technologies made us able to understand how fires behave in buildings. And once we've learned that, we could work with that and start designing buildings safer. But I really hope it's not just a trip to the past, to the origins of the zone modeling. I hope it's also going to open your eyes for the future use of these tools. My today's guest, Dr. Colleen Waite, when we were emailing about this episode, she asked me a question, do I think that zone modeling is dead? And my answer was, I certainly hope that after this podcast, it will not be dead. And myself, I'm a user of a zone model. I'm actually using B-Risk model developed by Colleen. And I know how powerful it is. model developed by Colleen. And I know how powerful it is. And it's such a shame that most of the fire scientists or engineers do not realize these capabilities and do not use it in everyday engineering. It could be related to the fact that we are maybe not thought zone modeling as much as we would be in 90s or 80s. Maybe some of us are not even aware that such a powerful tool exists. As Professor Rain mentioned in episode two, some of the PhD students or postdocs figure out that fire science exists one day before they apply for the position. So there are many among us who have not went through the full course of fire safety engineering maybe have never seen these models, and they are definitely powerful. Before I jump into the episode, for listeners who may not be aware what zone modeling is and how this model works, there's plenty of resources, which I'll link in the show notes. But basically, a zone model is a way to solve a fire problem within a compartment by dividing this compartment into zones. One of the zones would be the smoke underneath the ceiling. The other zone would be the cold gases underneath the smoke zone. The fire plume may be considered as a separate zone as well. This is why it's called zone modeling. And we basically track the shape of these zones, track the amount of smoke and energy in each of them, solve for transport between them. And with this, we can quite reasonably capture the evolution of the fire within the compartment. So yeah, that's the basics. And if you stay here and listen to the rest of the episode, you're going to know a lot more about zone modeling. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Hello everybody. Welcome to Firesize Show. Today I'm here with Dr. Colleen Wade from the Fire Research Group in New Zealand. Hello, Colleen. Hi, Wade. Thank you very much for the invitation today. Well, no, no. Thank you very much for coming. I much appreciate it that you found some time in your morning. Colleen is an expert on zone modeling, and that's a fascinating technique used in fire science. In the podcast so far, I had CFD experts, I had artificial intelligence experts, I had experts on all the new things and toys we use to solve for fire issues. But zone modeling is something from a different time in fire science. And I don't mean from a worse time. Maybe it was actually a better time for being a fire scientist. And myself, I'm a zone model user. And I would love to hear from you, Colleen. How was it like, I don't know, 20 years ago or 15 years ago when CFD was not so overwhelmingly abused over the world and when zonals were the tools? You know, when I first got involved, perhaps I'll just go back a little bit. involved in sort of zone modelling sort of way back when I was, even before I did my master's degree. So my undergraduate qualifications were in building science, and I was sort of coming toward the end of that and didn't really know much about fire at all. And I discovered the Fire Safety Journal in the library, and I kind of thought, you know what, and started flicking through some of the papers in there and thought, now this is really kind of interesting stuff in here. And in particular, there was one paper that kind of really inspired me, and it was, I think it was 1984. It was written by Len Cooper and it was all about kind of smoke movement and smoke filling in compartments and they had these really neat line drawings just showing the smoke filling process and the fire dynamics. And I kind of found that really inspirational. inspirational. Applied for a job as a kind of fire science, fire research scientist at Building Research Association in New Zealand. And then kind of got involved in, you know, in some of the sort of modelling aspects and the tools. And at the same time, that was when all, you know, there was a big push towards performance-based codes, kind of the new world of fire safety engineering. You know, previously there was a lot of prescriptive, use of prescriptive documents, and a real desire for people to start to apply some science and engineering to that. And I think some of the first tools in doing that, you know, was simple kind of zone models. And so, you know, you can go right back to the late 1980s, you know, the development of the Harvard Code. And then NIST, or National Bureau of Standards, as they were at the time, got really kind of involved and did some really good work. So, you know, starting with kind of, you know, the ASEP-B kind of model, and then into the FAST and CFAST. And I kind of got involved in, you know, looking at some of the early fire models, you know, the Hazard 1 code at NIST, which in a way was possibly a little ahead of its time, because it was doing toxicology calculations, and it had sort of a simple egress model in it, you know, the sorts of things that, you know, we still want to do today. But yes, so they did some fantastic work. I got involved at that point as kind of an interested user. And then a little bit further down the track, I actually got involved with kind of developing the zone model. And that really happened when I sort of went off and did a master's degree. I did that at Worcester Polytech, which was, you know, really, you know, at the time, there were very few places where you could, you know, you could do graduate study, you know, specifically in kind of fire. And one of the student projects at the time, Jonathan Barnett was teaching the fire dynamics. One of the projects that, you know, he would put to the students was everyone needed to write their own zone model. Write your own zone model. Write your own zone model. Write your own, you know, that was kind of the mid-year or the mid-term exam. Wow. And so some people did it in, you know, just kind of did simple kind of spreadsheet versions, just solving some differential equations. I kind of decided, you know, I was kind of interested in playing around with some Visual Basic programming, so I'd give it a go in Visual Basic. And it all really just grew from there. Wow, that's fascinating. I can imagine the faces of my students if I told them for the graduation they have to write a zone model. I don't know how much assassination costs nowadays, but I'm pretty sure they would pay the sum. That's brilliant. And I think the paper you've mentioned of Cooper in 1984, I think I recollect that paper and wasn't it like one of the first ones where ACID-R-CID concepts were explained and then shown in a function of time. It could have been because I recognize the name and the year. So I'll actually, I'll try to do my digging and maybe I'll find it out and I'll pop it in the show notes. That's going to be a nice trip down memory lane. It was a very good paper. And then NIST really kind of took up the mantle, particularly during the 1990s, and also Len Cooper again, you know, with almost kind of writing sub-models for the vent flows, both the horizontal vent flows and the vertical vent flows. And they did it in a really nice way that, you know, I kind of don't think I did anything particularly kind of original. What I ended up doing was kind of developing a core zone model, but then I would take work that others, you know, had done. And, you know, the work that NIST was really kind of very influential and done in such a way that they kind of made it easier to kind of understand the sub-model. And then, you know, my job was kind of to combine, you know, a couple of models together so that, you know, my job was kind of to combine, you know, a couple models together so that it could work with the zone model. Since there's different listeners to the podcast and not all of them are fire scientists, let's talk about in principle what zone models are. From my understanding, zone model is a way to solve like energy and mass balance in a compartment fire where you subdivide it into two layers, one with the smoke and one without. That's how I was taught. Is this a correct simplification of a zone model? Yes, I mean, that's pretty much it. You know, you've got your room, you're dividing it into a couple of control volumes, room, you're dividing it into a couple of control volumes, and you're trying to keep track of the mass and the energy which flows both sort of into and out of each of those control volumes. So typically with the zone model, you know, the user needs to define the fire source. So in terms of, usually that's done in terms of a heat release rate, but also, you know, mass loss rate. And then you're combining that with, I guess, empirical correlations. So the plume flow, how much air is going to be entrained into the plume, because that's going into the upper layer control volume. Then the vent flows, as I kind of mentioned, you've got sub-models for working out what the mass flows are sort of into and out of the vents. And then there's the heat transfer component. So there's the enthalpy flows, which accompany the vent flows, but there's also the convection and conduction into the boundary surfaces. So there's heat losses. So really that at its simplest level is kind of the zone model. And then there's ways to expand on that by adding additional rooms. I feel horrible now because I think the easiest way to explain it to someone who has never used a zone model is to say, like, in CFD you divide your space into lots of tiny cells and you solve all the equations for every tiny cell in your model. And in zone model, you basically have large cells. One of them is the smoke. The other one is fire. The third one is the rest of the room. And they just change their sizes as the flows come on, come in, come out. And you keep the track of how much air and energy is in each of them. I feel horrible because I had to start with CFD because that's probably more understood by modern engineers, and it maybe should not be. You've mentioned that you add empirical correlations, and I think here is where the true power of zone modeling comes into play. Because if you start adding complexities to CFD, it becomes like very difficult, time consuming, and very money consuming because of the complexity. Well, in zone model, calculations take roughly seconds, maybe minutes of time. So even if you triple the number of equations you solve for, it's not a big deal. And then you said empirical. So it means you take experiments, observe, try to figure out what happened in the experiment, and then implement it in this already solved set of equations for a compartment. Can you give examples of such models? Well, an obvious one is one of the, I guess, the original early submodels that found their way to a zone model is the ceiling jet. Of course, that's the precursor to calculations of sprinkler and heat detector response times. Originally, you know, just something like, you know, outputs correlation for the unconfined ceiling jet, that in there, and then add another differential equation to calculate the temperature rise and whatever the detector or the sprinkler sensing element is. And then further down the track, you know, you can build on that because you don't really have an unconfined ceiling jet. It's confined. It's sitting within a room in which you've got a developing hot layer. And so again, I go back to NIST and I think it was Bill Davis who developed a related model called JET, which took into account the heating of the sprinkler bulb, for example, by a hot layer. And so obviously it kind of speeds up, reduces the activation time a little bit. So kind of included that as another option just to get a slightly better sort of calculation of response times. But lots of possibilities. Some of the other things, and most of this work, you know, that was really all done while I was working at building research. And we had a good relationship with the University of Canterbury who were building their fire engineering programme and they had students looking for projects to do. And so various students worked on different parts of what we had called the Brands Fire model at that point. Things like calculating some model for glass for glass fracture. Those were one of the early ones that was added. Michael Sweetpoint was supervisor on that project. There were others like the inclusion of spill plumes, for example, which was kind of very practical. Oh yeah, that's the ones I used in my PhD. I really appreciate you've put it in the Brands Fire because it made me able to use them in my work. Yep. Again, you know, that was work that Roger Harrison did as part of his PhD. And again, I just kind of became the one who connected the two models, or the sub-model with his own model. You know, provided, you know, a lot more capability in terms of predicting balcony spill plumes or adhered spill plumes. And that's all kind of useful in the model. Rogers Harrison's thesis and research on spill plumes was literally the thing that made me change the course of my career from engineering to a scientist. So I owe him a keg of beer, at least. And he knows that the transaction will happen as soon as COVID goes away. Yeah. When we were exchanging emails, you've also mentioned the models for fire spread. And this seemed like really interesting because introducing like fire spread in CFD is sometimes quite difficult depends on what model you use. And you mentioned that it was your master thesis or something. How did you work that out? So I mentioned the midterm exam, writing the zone model. So the next thing I needed to do was find a thesis topic for my master's. And again, Jonathan Barnett pointed me in the direction of some work that had been done by Bjorn Carlson and also Jim Quinteri. And both of those guys had kind of looked at a thermal flame spread model for combustible linings. And again, you know, really good job in terms of kind of how they kind of explained and wrote up the models. And again, in a way that I could kind of pick up and translate into kind of a sub-model for the zone model. And so this is very much around trying to predict ignition, flame spread, and the amount of heat that would be released from combustible lining material back into the room. So I was kind of interested in being able to add that. You know, you've got your contents burning in your room, so that's kind of a source term in your zone model. But I wanted to add in the contribution from the lining materials. And so most of the work was really focused on actually trying to model the room corner test, the ISO 9705 test. So, you know, it had a very specific geometry of a burner in the corner of the room. And the approach, and obviously kind of the hard bit is, you know, what's the burning rate of the combustible lining, because that depends on what the material is and what the heat flux, the surface is and all those kind of things. And it kind of took a very simple approach, which was to say, let's just characterize the material using Kahn-Keller emitter data. So we know at different heat fluxes, we know what that heat release rate per unit area curve looks like. we know what that heat release rate per unit area curve looks like. And if we have that data at different heat fluxes, then we can kind of use that as a bit of a database and then just kind of interpolate and look up, depending on what the heat flux is at any particular time in the model and the period of time that the material's been burning. So the model was really just about including some ignition calculation of when we based on the heat output of the burner and then again add in another couple of differential equations for the upward flame spread, for the lateral flame spread, actually calculate at any particular time what is the area that we expect to be burning on the surface of the material. And we know that area. And from our own data, we know the heat release rate per unit area. So we can make an estimate of actually what is the heat being added back into the room. And then that gets added back into the zone model in terms of heat transfer. And in a way, that kind of simulates the kind of heating, the preheating process of the, for example, ceiling lining as the hot layer builds up. So that was, and that really sort of became the essence of what I did for the master's thesis, was to integrate those thermal flame spread equations into the zone model so that we could do predictions of the room quantities, for example. And I guess most of the validation is focused on that particular configuration and scenario. But in principle, you know, the calculations could then, they can still be done if you change the ventilation to the room or you change the dimensions a little bit or you change the heat output of the fire source. Just the downside was that to do it well, you needed quite a bit of cone data. And that one's very difficult to generalize, like to make it from a small number of samples. Like you mentioned, you need a lot of them to have truly worked out the material. Yeah. If you're only interested in the results of the ring corner test, it would be much cheaper just to go and do the ring corner test. Of course. It doesn't count calories to test. That's true. And this, like, if you propose this research today, it would get funded because today we're living in a time where mass timber is a question. Can we use it? Can we not use it in buildings? And I know your PhD was also on this topic, and you've also used zone modelling in this. Can you make a big jump from the master thesis into PhD and mass timber? So the master's work was very much focused on that pre-flashover period and the early fire growth and the hazards associated with that. So then, you know, much further down the track, I decided I'd quite like to do a PhD as well. And the whole field of interest in mass timber was continuing to increase, you know, the low carbon credentials, the kind of the aesthetic appeal of being able to expose timber structure, the desire to build bigger and taller mass timber buildings. And I had been for some time just working, again, with the zone model and more of a post-flashover capability, mainly just representing fire source in the forms of kind of wood cribs and using correlations to kind of describe the paralysis of the cribs. And then so I guess for the PhD then I was thinking, you know, how do we, you know, can we do a better job in terms of accounting for the contribution that exposed timber surface would have to the post-flash overfire? And that was where this kind of beginning of that. So it was similar to what we've done before, but it was a kind of different approach as well. But again, you take empirical studies, known science and implement it into the code and just fine-tune it until it works. And instead of like solving for weeks on CFD code, I truly admire this approach. And I think it's almost proven to be very capable of like growing with the scientists by the ability to add these particular sub-models, replace them as you have better ones, and improve the overall model. And because it's a zone model, you spend less time developing data transfer techniques, saving data to your hard drives. You don't have all these issues, these computational issues that have to be really, really worked out in CFD modeling. From my perspective, I'm a user of Ansys Fluent, and that's a different software than most of the people in FIRA would be using. And we have this whole, let's say, array of sub-models that can be turned on and off as you wish but we have this because it was developed for general use by wind turbine companies or aerodynamics companies and we just use a tiny fraction of it. Most people are using, let's say, FDS. They rely on what has been put into the software by NIST, and NIST is obviously limited by the number of people that can work on this project in their time in the office. And even if you have a hundred great ideas how to improve FDS, it's very unlikely they all or most of them will be implemented because it will be very time consuming to not only solve the physics, but also solve the computational part and how they will influence the basic ability of FDS to calculate. And in zone models, I have never developed a zone model on my own. Maybe I should have gotten a mid-track assignment to do that, but I assume it's probably easier to fiddle with the code and just change the equations a bit. Yes, for sure. It did get a little bit complicated with the mass timber model because... Okay. I'd like to say it was all very simple, but I guess one of the differences there was that it was suggested to me by Danny Hopkins, who sort of pointed me in the direction of kind of a kinetic pyrolysis model. So this was kind of a, you might think, well, is that almost too complicated for a zone model? But we did kind of, you know, we did get it working. So what we're doing here really is looking specifically at wood products and separating out the individual constituents, you know, the hemicellulose, the cellulose and the lignin, and then also accounting for the moisture. And include equations to describe the decomposition of those, you know, as a function of the temperature within the – so that was kind of at one level of extreme. So, you know, I played around with a few different sort of types of model for the mass timber. I mean, the very simplest one really was just to treat a solid as a – just to look at the heat conduction into the solid and then just to use the old kind of 300 degree isotherm in the char. Okay. As the simulation proceeded, you just kind of take that char, add it back to the fuel in the room, which kind of extends the duration. So that was the very simplest one, but that has much more limitation in terms of perhaps the accuracy of what's going on, that depth, and in terms of the charring process. It worked quite well in terms of predicting maybe the gas phase and the gas temperatures in the compartment. It was a bit more challenging in terms of being able to get a better estimate of the char depth. And so that's where the kinetic model did a better job of that. But even so, you know, there's still lots of limitations in terms of really not being able to describe all of the physics to an appropriate level, you know, some of the oxidation effects and things which went. So even given all of that, the zone model still gives you some ability to include some calibration. So, you know, you get around that in terms of producing something which is usable potentially by industry. And, you know, I've always been very keen on, you know, doing research, you know, which doesn't just sit on a shelf in a report. And I guess that's why I keep coming back to the zone model. It's been a very convenient way of incorporating research into something which is actually usable, potentially usable by industry. You are my kind of scientist, a very rare breed to combine science engineering in a way that it's useful. Yeah, I think that's the best way to go. That's the best way to go. And with these abilities to add models and expand zone models, when you look at them today, you see very, very powerful tools. When you look at B-Risk, it's a powerful tool for multi-parametric analysis and probabilistic studies. You look at the CFAST, it's a complete package for compartment fire dynamics. And yet, if you jump into the world of engineering companies, of everyday fire safety engineers, I would doubt that many of them would be using these tools on not even databases, but even on a weekly or monthly basis. I think there are far more complex and far less useful tools being used every day. So I wonder if you could, like, maybe not advertise, but if you could give a good piece of advice to a young engineer that just came to their office on the first day, why they should invest time to learn zone modeling and try to use them in their practice. No, I would say there's not one tool that's going to do everything on every job. The engineer needs to have a toolkit of different models to use in different applications. Sometimes a zone model is all you need. Other times you really do need to go that extra step and do CFD. Sometimes you might, you know, if you think about the uncertainty in fires, you know, you can spend a whole lot of time doing a very detailed CFD calculation and you really, you know, really get drawn into the precision of the output. When you go back and look the precision of the output, when you go back and look at the input and say, oh, you know, within 20, 30, 40 percent, there's a little uncertainty at one end. So I think you've got to kind of look at that. And I think this is where potentially the power of some probabilistic capability is where zone models could really shine in the future. Because if you do have a finite amount of computing resource, is it better to put all of that into a few CFD models? Or maybe you could do hundreds and thousands of zone models that give you maybe a much better understanding of what some of the uncertainty both in the input and out. One of the other things that I think we should mention with the zone model when it starts, you know, it was when the development of B-Risk in more recent times, and the risk was really a desire to include some more Monte Carlo and probabilistic capability. include some more Monte Carlo and probabilistic capability. But another part of that was looking at something we called a design fire generator. This was something that my colleague Rick Baker worked on as part of his PhD. But the idea was to be able to have multiple fuel packages or pieces of furniture sort have multiple fuel packages or pieces of furniture sort of in your room or your space, be able to assign them with different kind of ignition properties and be able to kind of randomly sort of locate them within the room and then kind of look at the potential for fire spread from one to another. And so what we were able to do was to be able to run some Monte Carlo simulations whereby you have a certain number of items. Each simulation, you just randomly put them in different locations. You could either just have the same item igniting, or you could randomly choose that. And doing that sort of gives you a whole family of possible heat release ray curves. It's not just kind of one curve. And it kind of just shows the potentials just for the same room, same ventilation, same set of furniture items. You can still get a whole range of design fire scenarios. It hasn't been used a great deal, but perhaps I'll mention one of the more recent uses of it, which was something that Antonio Sassioni from the University of Stellenbosch approached me some time ago. And he was doing work in the area of informal settlement dwelling fires, you know, which is a pretty big problem. I understand there's at least, I think, 5,000 fires of that sort a year just in South Africa alone. And he had this idea of being able to develop some kind of screening tool, being able to kind of simulate how fire might spread in that environment. And he was interested in using B-Risk to do that. But actually, he wasn't really thinking about the zone model. He was thinking about how he could use this design by generator to look at potential spread from one dwelling unit to another. A zone model minus the upper layer. Yeah, so it's a zone model with a very big room and very well-completed conditions. Very, very well. Okay, yeah. So you're really just focusing on the fire spread capability. Okay. But I think it worked surprisingly well. You know, he was able to include things like maybe looking at wind direction and wind strength, and again, kind of adding a correlation that includes some tilt on the basic fire plume. And then the fire spread between items was sort of mainly done using just simple point source radiation model. And, you know, in my view, it kind of actually did a really good job, and it certainly worked a bit better than I might have thought. You're really shaming me here because at some point Antonio did reach out to us because he was interested in wind and how wind affects the spread between settlements. And we've approached it with a good old CFD, and we've played a lot with Antonio with the wind and fire, comparing to his field experiments. I think at the end, we've eventually made it to simulations that roughly represent the experimental conditions and can capture the transition between these settlements. But these calculations take like like week to complete and there you really have to invest a lot of resources to just capture the the moment of the flame spread and when you say in in b risk you can just define the inputs as a range of values or range of items that are in the in the room with their individual characteristics that I assume also can be ranges. And then just run 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to get all the potential outcomes. I think I've played with that capability of BeRisk at some point, and I remember it was giving me like 97% of cases you did not get to a flashover. In 3%, you got to a flashover. The maximum temperature of these old simulations was, I don't know, this value. And in like 80th percentile, it was this value. I found it like really for such a simple tool. I don't want to downplay the complexity and effort put into developing this tool. But in the fire engineer toolbox it is it would be considered a simple tool and yet it is so uh so powerful um you're working in new zealand now and new zealand is i'm right right you're in new zealand okay so so new zealand is this uh this beautiful place on earth when you had very early performance-based engineering and you were ahead of most of us, is BeRisk. Because BeRisk also has some modules that are specific to your verification method. And is it really a tool that is being used by engineers or not so much as well? BeRisk is being used. And I guess it's certainly partly a result of the verification method, which is one of the methods that fire engineers can use to demonstrate compliance. So the verification method has a number of kind of design fire scenarios and some kind of defined design fire characteristics. So just in order to make those calculations a little bit easier, a bit more streamlined for the engineer, there's what we call a VM2 mode in B-Risk, which really just sets some of the default values, particularly around the design fire, and perhaps sort of disable some of the sub-models which are not sort of applicable to the verification method. So it was just to make things a little bit easier. The downside of that, I think, is that probabilistic side doesn't get perhaps used as much as it might. And I think, you know, the future really is, you know, to make much better use of the power that you can have by doing Monte Carlo and looking at the probabilistic aspects and just trying to quantify some of the uncertainty in that. For me, that's definitely where the future in zone modelling is. On the one hand, the other great opportunity is to couple it with, you know, with egress models. You know, so for example, you know, if we could have the fire model talking to the egress model and then doing the toxicity calculations, we can now start to get a much more useful probabilistic picture. probabilistic picture. And that was kind of our target, that's ambition and developing B-RISC to kind of get away from just thinking about, you know, single kind of deterministic calculations and starting to look at what can we generate in terms of trying to understand the actual risk. So that's really the kind of big thing I sort of hoped would happen at some point, you know, sometime in the not too distant future, is that we can have zone models and egress models kind of working seamlessly together and being able to do thousands of simulations and generating probabilistic curves of the resulting safety. You were kind of reading my mind because that was the next thing I wanted to ask you. And that was not on the script I've sent you, so I'm truly amazed with this ability. And for the question, why I have asked it is that in Poland I had these cases where zone models was employed in a fire research project or fire engineering project. It was downplayed by the authorities that it may not be, I don't know, accurate enough. I think what they've meant is it was not impressive enough as CFD is because we sometimes go into this complex modeling because it gives you an impression that it is very advanced. And because it is advanced, it must be better, right? And that's absolutely not the case when you understand the copatifying dynamics and how it works. And you can obviously see that for many, many cases, zone model would be a much, much better choice than a CFD model. And it makes me happy that, well, if you have a proper legislation and if the legal system in a country is set in a way that allows for certain tools to be used like you have this verification method that allows you for using zone models and burris keys is crafted to fit within that framework then it gets used and then people don't waste time people don't waste money authorities don't worry if this is advanced enough or shiny enough. It just is accepted, and that makes me very happy. And the other thing you've said about the multi-parametric analysis and probabilistic approach, this is also very, very powerful because today if you approach an engineering project, for example, you have to design a smoke control in the shopping mall. I don't know if you do 10 simulations 20 maybe 30 30 cfd simulations for a single building will already be a craziness and then that would cost a lot of money and obviously zone models may not have the ability to simulate such big buildings yet because of the limits related to the the fact there must be zones for zone model to work. There obviously are limits. But for some aspects, like individual shopping units and parts of the building, like corridors, maybe zone model would be perfectly fine, and then just use CFD for spill plumes or something. I mean, yeah, it sounds like... And then with zone model, you could do hundreds of these simulations, thousands of these simulations, thousands of these simulations use the design fire generator to generate hundreds of design fires talk about this in terms of probabilities talk about risk the true risk, not just the perceived value of risk based on the fact if you have met visibility in this one scenario or not. It's not an indication of the safety in the whole building if in one particular scenario your visibility was 11 meters, so it's good. Here what you're touching is a truly holistic view on how fire can develop in a building and what can be outcomes of thousands of fires. And the last thing that you've mentioned, the coupling evacuation with the probabilistic simulations, that's like some kind of ultimate tool for fire engineering. If this was available, it is available in a way. I think you can make it work. I know my colleague Adam Kraski, is developing his touch on coupling CFAST with, I think, his custom-made evacuation model. And I know there are efforts like that ongoing in the world. So eventually we'll have a very good and useful tool to couple evacuation to zone modeling. And, yeah, then you can go with fractional effective doses and stuff like that to truly capture if people are endangered in the building or not. It's a whole new world that opens because these tools get constantly better. The irony is that I mentioned earlier the HazardOne software, right back in the early, you know, the original tool, which had the egress in there and had the toxicity in there. And it was kind of the, maybe it was ahead of its time, you know, it didn't have the Monte Carlo, but kind of see we're almost going around in a full circle. It's just a shame it's taken us so long. You know, through this discussion, you've mentioned so many things you've done with zone models or people have done with zone models i see like every every this idea you pitch if you wrote a grant today and just replace the world's own model with like cfd code it would like that would be a powerful grant and uh i i like i really feel horrible within this interview because i'm i'm a engineer and that's what all of my colleagues use. That's what my generation uses. And behind the wall, there's this super powerful, very cheap, fairly easy to learn tool that has such powerful capabilities. And it's such a shame you don't see that used in everyday engineering. Maybe after this episode, there will be some fire engineers that discovered zone modeling and the beauty of it. And I certainly recommend downloading BeRisk. It's free and available and has great technical documentation that will get you through. Actually, if you do that, just poke me on LinkedIn or Twitter and tell me that you used it and that you love it. If you don't like it, don't tell me. But if you love it, tell me and I'll tell Colleen and we'll be very, very happy. So do you think there's a future for zone models in our field? I certainly do think there's a future. And, you know, as I said I said just requires people to you know just kind of look at the whole suite of tools that they have available to them to solve problems and zone models are very much one of those tools and I don't see them going away anytime soon. I hope not. I hope not as well. I mean vRisk is still being developed. I know CFAST is maintained. So that's pretty good. So that, I mean, the more users there are, the more questions there are asked to the developers of these programs. Yeah. And the more incentive there is to keep on developing and maintaining these kind of codes. Yeah. Also, one thing that I forgot to ask you, I've also known about these efforts by Niels Johansson, who's going into multi-zone modeling where he divides the compartment not into a single smoke layer, but into a number of smaller control volumes. And he again solves the mass and energy balance between them. The bonus is that you don't have one single homogeneous smoke layer spanning over your whole compartment, but you can have some temperature or flow gradients in the, sorry, velocity gradients inside the layer. I mean, from your experience with zone models, was it something that was coming in and out of zone models? Because I think I've heard about similar concepts like 15 years ago. Yes, I think there's some researchers in Japan who have done something similar. And again, I think that's a great idea. It fills a gap between the very simple two-zone and CFD, which just gives you a bit more capability, you know, and maybe that could have good application for, you know, smoke filling and maybe just larger industrial warehouse kind of spaces where maybe the zone model was just, you know, that the rooms are getting a little bit too large or you just want a little bit more great resolution of both your variation from one end to the other. So I think that's a great development too. As we're talking, there are things going through my head. And one of these thoughts is that in our modeling software in ANSYS, we have this capability to choose two different turbulence models, like realizable K-epsilon for most of the model. capability to choose two different turbulence models, like Reel-Easible K-Epsilon for most of the model, and it can change into LES if something happens, like if you model a race car and there's a spoiler and you would like to solve the turbulence at the spoiler with LES, it will solve it, but just in that region, and the rest is solved in a very simplistic turbulence model because you're basically solving the surroundings of the car. And it's called scale adaptive simulation. I was wondering if one could couple like CFD and zone model in a way that the compartment is modeled with the zone model, and when you hit an obstacle or where you hit a very like complex geometry a mall a part of a car park that's complex then you switch into cfd to solve the difficult part and then maybe go back to a zone model in the in the rest of the building that would certainly be uh that would that could be interesting if if we got the best of of both worlds in in one model. That's right. Maybe that's going to be the solution. I'm pretty sure it's possible. On the other hand, you could just implement like zone model as a part of a bigger CFD code and just use it as a boundary condition generator, right? And just solve the compartment and get the mass flow in, mass flow out, pop it on an inlet in your CFD code. Actually, we may try that. We may try that with ANSYS. It's possible to program stuff like that in ANSYS. That could be actually very interesting. I'm going to try it. I'm going to find a student and give him a midterm assignment to write a zone model for my ANSYS code. write a zone model for my answers code. Okay. I think we're reaching the time limits. I wanted to talk with you about the design fires, but the zone model discussion was already so interesting. There's no need to subdivide into a second topic. And if I had to do it again, I would do it again on the zone models. That was really good. So, second topic and if i had to do it again i would do it again on the zone models that that was uh that was really good so um colleen uh thank you very much for coming to the to the podcast and i hope you enjoyed that and thank you very much for watching me again yes i really appreciate it it was great talking to you and i i hope there if we can find at least one engineer that gets into the world of zone modeling after this podcast, I think we have accomplished a mission. And I really hope for that. Thank you so much for being here and all the best year round. Thank you very much. Yep. So that's it. What a great talk it was with Colleen. and she really makes it look easy when she says she just added this model, this model, this model into a zone model, which she has actually written. And trust me, it's much more difficult than it sounded to develop this type of tools. But I also think we can consider this as a testimony to how powerful this modeling is. If a single person or a small group of people can develop such a powerful software and on top of the compartment fire dynamics framework fit all the additional sub-models like flame spread, pyrolysis, the role of mass timber in the compartment fire, or this super powerful model for subsequent item ignition to develop custom-based design fires. It truly shows the endless possibilities within zone modeling, which if you wanted to implement in like CFD tools, I mean, that would be quite, quite challenging. If you have never played with a zone model, I absolutely urge you to go to Brandt's FHIR site and download the BIRISC model, which Colleen had a significant part in developing of. BIRISC is a fantastic model. It has great probabilistic capabilities, Monte Carlo simulations, which allow you to look on the fire in a completely different way than we usually do with our CVD calculations, which are limited by the cost of the calculations usually. So, yeah, that's your homework. If you have never used the zone modeling in your life, go download Perisc, play with it, and see how powerful it is. It's going to take you 10 minutes to master the basics, and BeRisk has a really, really well-written user guide to get you through that. So definitely, definitely worth your time to go and see how it works. And a final thought about zone modeling. We as engineers, we have a toolbox. The toolbox has all the tools that we need to solve problems. And it's our role to pick a tool that's appropriate for a problem to be solved. And trust me, zone modeling or in general compartment fire framework is a fantastic tool in this toolbox. in general, Compartment Fire Framework, is a fantastic tool in this toolbox. And it's a tool that gives you answers, gives them quickly, gives you wide view over a problem. It will not generate fancy graphics. It will not generate beautiful plots that will amaze your stakeholders. But it will generate answers to your questions. And if you use it well, if you use it smart, if you understand the limitations, you can truly master the strength of this tool. It allows you to do amazing things in seconds, like literally in seconds. So, yeah, be aware of that tool be aware of the capabilities try to learn it a bit and and see if that can fit into your engineering routine and i hope it it will i know it does because it fits in my routine and it's very useful for my work in designing smoke control systems in buildings. And actually, I use zone modeling to develop custom fire experiments for my clients. And it's really useful to capture things like flashover and general heat transfer within a compartment. So, Colleen asked, is zone modeling dead? My answer is absolutely no. And I hope after this, it's more alive than ever. I hope you've enjoyed this episode. And yeah, see you next Wednesday thank you this was the fire science show thank you for listening and see you soon
