 Welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today we're going to talk less engineering, more, let's say, organization of the fire community and some advancements that have been made over the last decade. We're going to talk about education, the new generation of fire safety engineers, and we will do this on a very, very good example. We will discuss the program carried at four universities, Edinburgh, Lund, Ghent, and Universitat Politecnica Catalunya. It's called International Masters in Fire Safety Engineering, IMFSE, and it's a blast. There's a bunch of people who have already graduated from the 10 years of this program. They are praised as one of the best young fire engineers entering the work market. They seem to be great fire scientists. There, in general, seems to be great development towards these young people that is worth copying or worth admiration. And this is what I really wanted to learn today from one of the creators of the program, Professor Bart Mercier of Kent University, and the newest member of the consortium, Professor Eulalia Planas from Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. We will discuss how IMFSE came to life and where it's heading nowadays. But the podcast episode is not just on the IMFSE. I guess it's interesting to learn about it, but it does not touch many of us. I guess it's interesting to learn about it, but it does not touch many of us. I think the importance of this episode is in understanding what makes this group of people excelling, why this particular group of people is so successful in fire safety engineering. And is there a way how we can copy some of the things they do there in improving our own education curriculums in our countries or maybe trainings in our organizations. Or maybe you're just a student who would like to make a switcheroo and pick a new destination. Or maybe you would just like to remind yourself the good student days. Maybe this episode will bring you some nice memory flashbacks. Hope they're nice, actually. So, for me, it was an interesting journey to learn about this project and a chance to talk to nice people, as usual. So, yeah, let's learn about IMFSE. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the Firesize Show. I'm joined today by Professor Bart Merci of Ghent University. Hey, Bart, great to have you in the show. Hello, Wojciech. And Professor Eulalia Planas from Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. Hello, Eulalia, great to have you in the show. Hello. How are you? I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm about to have a great interview. So always, always great to be in this mindset. good about to have a great interview so always always great to be in this mindset the one thing that connects you both outside of being fire scientists is that you're part of imfse consortium and this is what we're going to talk about today but not only praising of your of your magnificent master's program as the best in the world but also to try and understand why it is the best in the world, but also to try and understand why it is the best in the world and how some others could, in some parts at least, copy your success. Because, oh boy, we're not in an excess of good fire safety engineers in the world. Not at all. So my first question towards Bart, let's move in time. I don't know how many years, even 12, 15, how long ago the idea happened. And what makes you think, like, wake up in the morning and think, I'm going to go through the madness of MSC program to start the world's best fire engineering course? Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Wojciech. Thanks for the kind words. It's proven by experiment. Well, you know, indeed. I mean, you call it some madness, and it's true. When we started, there was a lot of work involved to get things started. A little bit of history then, perhaps, is that a bit more than 15 years ago, a predecessor at Kent University initiated the idea of starting a postgraduate program in fire safety engineering at Kent University. And as a junior academic, I was the one who had the pleasure of doing all the admin. But I really shared the vision that there was a need for fire safety engineering. But once the admin was completed for the local program at Kent University, I figured it would make sense to approach the universities of Lund and Edinburgh, who were and are leading institutes in Europe, to see if we could join forces and create this international program. And both were very enthusiastic, and then we just gave it a shot and submitted a file to the European Commission. And we were very happy to learn that from the start, they decided to support us, probably partly because we were all leading institutes in the field of fire safety engineering, but also there was no other international program on fire safety engineering. And so I certainly know that science because we immediately asked for a two-year master's program so that we could cover all the aspects and also take advantage of the specific expertise of each institute so that we could really create what we still believe is a very strong program. This is how it got started. Yeah, and it's just getting better since then, for sure. Growing and getting new partners. So many institutions are supporting IMFSC. We're going to touch about that in a second, but I need to ask one more thing to your comment. Ghent had its own FSC program. Lund had its own. Edinburgh had its own. How did the introduction of IMFSC change the landscape of your own university? Like looking now we know what happened 10 years after it did not cannibalize your own program. I think it's even better than it used to be. So what was your experience like proposing a secondary program to a local one? Well, a major challenge was not to convince the academics in fire safety engineering. It was convincing the institutes to issue a joint degree, because that involves also issuing a degree where most students visit each institute, but not all of them. So you have to trust each other that you are delivering quality. And that proved challenging, but clearly not impossible, because this is what we also could offer from the start. And as you say, we didn't cannibalize our own programs. And actually, that was also foreseen, because we attract many, many international students, which has been a challenge for local programs worldwide. And thanks to the scholarships granted by the European Commission, we managed to attract students that otherwise would not have studied at Edinburgh or Lund or Ghent. So we did not, say, divert existing students from existing programs into IMFSE to a very large extent for students that would otherwise not have been in Europe. And have you observed an increased interest in just fire safety engineering in Ghent based on the international success of IMFSE? Yes, certainly, to some extent, yes. But one thing that we are still struggling with, at least locally in Belgium, is the brand name of fire safety engineering. And this is because we have prescriptive legislation in Belgium. So that means that the term fire safety engineering is not as well known as in countries that are more performance-based, design-oriented. And so it shows that there is still a lot of potential, I think, for many more people potentially being interested in the field of fire safety engineering that today is still, to some extent, unknown, even with architects in Belgium. I don't know if you have humanities department, but maybe you should start a code speak department or something that's more fit for non-FSC countries. Lalia, now to you. Your university, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, is a new family member, a new partner at IMFSC. Tell me, how did you find yourself in the project and what was the main goal of introducing a new partner from outside of the scope that others covered? Well, in fact, we had some previous relationship in terms of research with Lund University, also with Edinburgh. I've been doing several researches together. So they knew each other since quite long, although we were more focused on risk and safety, quite long, although we were more focused on risk and safety, the industry, the process industry, and also we've been working since many years in the field of wildfires. In fact, it was Bart who approached us to try to improve or to bring together those disciplines because, in fact, industrial safety was already part of the program uh maybe not so deep in the knowledge but it's already inside but not uh while on facts would but not part maybe sometimes as a guest lecture or something that was not included in the program so they see there is a need for the students to know about the future challenges of fire safety engineering, which include all the interaction of the wildland fires with the built environment. We have seen many problems in the recent years in the wildland-urban interface, so this is something that the new graduates should be able to tackle. I think Southern Europe has experienced far more of these issues than us comfortably sitting in the middle. And your other IMFC partners from a little bit to the north. But unfortunately, this is heading right towards us. And it's a great, great direction to expand the program to give it this twist. I wonder how popular will it be to follow the wild and urban interface road. And I really also appreciate you expanding on the risk and industrial applications route. That is something that we also see growing, the use of risk methods in fire engineering, outside even of industry. I mean, I know panels and applications like that. But to my understanding, you don't have a fire safety engineering program at this moment at UPC yet. No, not yet. And I would say not even in any other part of Spain, although there is a quite huge industry behind fire safety engineering in Spain. And for example, in Catalonia, there is a cluster of companies related to the fire safety domain, let's say, and they have huge problems to find trained people, people knowing about fire safety engineering. So we are approached many, many times because our school is a school of engineering. So we have mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, materials engineers, different kinds of engineers. And we teach some courses, optional courses courses for them from introduction to the fire safety engineering so some of them came to the final phases and and they are picked quickly they are not even specialists they just have a little bit of knowledge on fire safety engineering. Well, I don't know exactly why is the reason of that, but IMFC will bring a little bit to cover this gap right now. I think it will be really, really good. Yeah, it's great we're having this discussion because what you described is not only description of the situation in Spain, it would be the description of situation in many, many countries in terms of professional education of fire safety engineers. And you now are very lucky to have IMFSC. However, let's face it, it's producing fantastic, fantastic students, but not at the great numbers. I mean, 30 is a great number, but nowhere close to what industry needs. So I guess eventually you would be also interested in replicating the model of the success in your own institution or at least your own country. That's exactly what we're trying to discuss today. How to do that. Bart, now a question to you. When you were forming the first curriculum of the course, I'm interested, how did you pick what the people must learn and in what order? Maybe because now we have the, for example, SFP or competencies guide, which was a big project. I talked with the podcast with Jimmy Johnson about it. It was quite interesting to point out what the fire safety engineer needs to know. I guess 15 years ago, you had to invent that wheel on your own. And it's pretty round, I would say, that wheel, it works. So how did you decide what to do and how does the program look now? Yeah, thanks for that question, Polchek. Well, we didn't really have to invent the wheel. I mean, it's true what you say that a few years ago, We didn't really have to invent the wheel. I mean, it's true what you say, that a few years ago, the SFP came up with a very, I think, comprehensive and useful overview of what would be expected competencies. But in the middle of the 90s, there was also the model curriculum that had been developed by IFSS, and that had been published in 1995, which was, I would say, written more as an academic document, whereas the SFPE document takes more of the profession, I would say, as point of view. But that model curriculum really helped us a lot to streamline our first curriculum. And so when we came to think of it, putting our heads together, we all agreed quite quickly that we would attract students with diverse backgrounds, meaning that students entering the program would have a background in mechanical engineering or structural engineering, architects, even chemical engineering. So it's quite a varied group as they enter the program, So it's quite a varied group as they enter the program, which is challenging, but at the same time enriching. But it did lead us to define the first semester such that by the end of that first semester, everybody spoke the same language. And in terms of technical terms, I mean them. And so somebody with structural engineering background would have a relatively easy first semester when it came to those types of courses, but they would struggle perhaps a bit more in thermodynamics. And then mechanical engineer and chemical engineer would have the opposite, let's say, effort to do. This on top, of course, of settling in a new country for many of them, a new culture as well. But that's another part of the story. But by the end of the first semester then, everybody has, let's say, the same equipment in terms of skills and knowledge to enter semester two, where they are all together at Lund University. And then you can build on that, teaching some more advanced phytonamics, looking at human behavior, looking at risk assessments, and introducing them to the first simulation tools. And then in semester three, from that point onward, we can go more to our own specialties. So at the University of Edinburgh, traditionally, that was more structural fire engineering. At Ghent University, we go in-depth in different types of fire protection, active fire protection, passive fire protection. We teach about legislation. We also have a course on industrial fire protection with UPC on board. It's clear that in semester three they will learn there more about buoy and wildland fires and more advanced, I would say, also risk and industry fire protection. So in a nutshell, I mean, streamlining the curriculum was an exercise, surely. But if you start from a model curriculum as a starting point, as a framework, and you think about the final competencies that you would like to achieve, starting from different backgrounds, it was a reasonably natural exercise to do that. And overall, over the years, it did not change all that much. We introduced some new courses based on feedback from industry, feedback from students. And so one of them, for example, using big data to analyze and drive fire hazards. And so these things, yes, and they have been introduced into the curriculum. But the backbone over the years has not changed all that much. And interestingly, if you read back now the 1995 model curriculum, you would still reasonably accept that what was written there was quite visionary of what the fire safety engineer even today still has to do. There have been many modern tools, and we have much more information and databases than 30 years ago. But the overall competencies, when you come to think of it, what you would expect from a fire safety engineer are fairly stable. I have this paper in front of my eyes. As you mentioned it, I quickly Googled it, and I'm simply mind-blown by the names on the front page. It's Manguson, Drysdale, Fitzgerald, Motavelli, Maurer, Quintiri, Williamson. That's a fairly good group of quite competent people. It speaks visionary from just the authors list. So indeed, I must say I have not known that paper. I will link it in the show notes. I'm very interested in delving into that after the quite a different skill set than most of fire engineering. Also, in terms of like how the threats are communicated, how risk is communicated to people, there is probably a little more biology involved. I don't know about you, Bart, but I very rarely care about moisture of my stuff unless it's concrete and it's above 50%. Other than that, moisture, I don't care about moisture of my stuff unless it's concrete and it's above 50%. Other than that, moisture, I don't care about that. How does the mindset of structural engineer or mechanical chemical engineer work with transferring after all of this into WUI? Well, there are some parts of the knowledge you need to acquire new, but it's not that much because it's mostly related to the vegetation, which is life instead of a dead material, let's say we have in buildings. So, of course, there is that part of having a live material that has moisture content, and it affects the way the process of combustion behaves. So you need to know the different kind of vegetations and the models, how we model vegetation, how fire behaves when burning vegetation, life and death, and so on. Sorry to interrupt you. And they learn this, I guess, through laboratories and experiments, not through handbooks. Is that correct? Yeah, well, we have a course on wildfire behavior in general. So let's learn what are the main differences between fires in the built environment and fires in the forest, and what are the different models to represent fire behavior, what are the main components of fuel that affect fire behavior, etc. And, of course, we can work in the lab how this works. So first we learn, of course, the basis of what is already known on wildfire behavior, and then we go to the lab and we can see directly, seeing how vegetation burns and works. At what point does the student must decide which path they go? The students, they make that decision. Well, actually they make a proposal. It's the management boards in the end that decides. But mostly we can simply follow the student's proposal. They do that when they are in Lund. So in spring, second semester of the first year, so spring of the calendar year, they ask to which university or they suggest to the university where they want to go in semesters three and four. So also for the master dissertation topic, they decided at that stage, because that is the point where they have learned enough, let's say, of the basics to find out where their main interest is. Some of them have some professional background before entering the program, and then these people often already have a very clear idea the moment they set foot in Ghent or Edinburgh. They already know what they want to do in the second year. But for the ones who are new to the field, then they need to know a bit about everything before they can make up their mind what is their field of interest. And that's why they choose them. And, for example, if a lawyer is having a course on vegetation and someone is doing stuff in Edinburgh. Is it possible to hop in, hop off? Or these are like a whole semester long courses and it's not? No, indeed. It's semester long courses. And so that's also to try and keep things manageable in terms of mobility. This is the way we work. We just went through a pandemic. I guess everyone noticed. Has that changed your way of operations at all? During the pandemic, for sure. So then, obviously, we, as everyone, I assume, we went to online mode. But now, since everything got started again, the normal mode of operandi is on-campus teaching. And obviously, we still have now more people missing classes because COVID has not disappeared from the planet and also lecturers can be struck by the virus. And then we move to online teaching and we still also now have the reflex of recording classes and making those available. But it's only a backup solution. So our main mode of teaching is really on campus. And I must say that even during the pandemic, I mean, given that the groups were not excessively large and that at each institute we have large auditoria, we often managed to still do on-campus teaching by large spreading and large auditoria. And students appreciated that very much. Everybody felt very isolated. I know that I felt very isolated during the pandemic, and so it was always a pleasure to meet people again in person. And again, also, I really want to stress that the community building is also very, very strong in IMFSE. And I'm not going to say it's the major asset, but it definitely adds to the, let's say, the theory teaching and the exercises and whatever principles we are teaching. I mean, knowing people, as we all know, is sometimes equally important as having knowledge. I also feel that there is this very strong bond between the students. feel that there is this very strong bond between the students and what's fascinating is that it's not only the bond between the students of the same year, which you would probably expect because they live together and work together, but even, you know, between generations of IMFSE students, there is this feeling of association that I am part of this larger community. You just had this 10-year anniversary even, and that gathered like how many, like more than 100 people was there, right? Yes, yes, that is correct. And that was very rewarding, I must say. And it shows how, I mean, alumni have some pride in having the title, but also they clearly look back to their IMFSE period as a very pleasant and positive period during their lives which I guess to some is also maybe a little bit of a surprise because many of them are very stressed when they arrive which I fully understand, I mean it's very difficult to adjust in a country that you don't know, you don't know the habits in the case of Ghent you don't speak the language in Dutch and it's very stressful but it also stimulates the You don't know the habits. In the case of Gantz, you don't speak the language in Dutch. And it's very alien. It's stressful, but it also stimulates the bonding within the group because everybody helps each other. There is indeed intergenerational relationships because we have buddies also, and we always ask second years if they want to be the buddy of incoming students. There are links through nationalities. And you can imagine someone from a certain country asking, oh, do you have any alumni from my country? Then we bring them into contact with each other and they can talk to each other. And indeed, I mean, this is I think a very important point in our program. Do you have statistics of how many countries were represented in IMFSE? Yes. By now, we are more than 80 nationalities, so that's quite impressive. And I really wonder, is there a secret list of pubs ranked by popularity passed from generation of IMFSC students to the next generations? I'm pretty sure such a resource exists and now you need to make one for Barcelona as well. I'm pretty sure also that the amount of pubs in Barcelona will top the rest of the consortium altogether. So the possibilities are endless. When the students split after Lund, I guess it's some sort of even number. So you work with quite small groups of students. How do you manage that as an academic? Is it just normal, like lectures, laboratory experiments, and then some calculation works going? How do you manage such a small group? Because it's interesting. Yeah, well, I think it's a mix of different kinds of knowledge tools, let's say. Also, in some cases, for example, in Barcelona, some of the courses are also courses that are being attended for other students of other master's degree, for example, the chemical engineering master's degree. They will share the risk and safety at the chemical industry course, for example. So they will not be alone, the 15 or, let's say, around 15 students. Maybe they will come to Barcelona. They will share this course with other master's students at UBC. And, of course, for example, the wildland fire behavior will be a course mostly for the IMFSC students. And that will allow us to apply more lab sessions, probably. So it's a mix of theory lectures with lab courses with specialists or people from the companies that can bring and do a lecture. I think it's like the same in Gantt and in Edinburgh. do a lecture. I think it's like the same in Gantt and in Edinburgh. It sounds like, again, seeking the things that distinguish this program from my own fire safety engineering course, it seems very individual. Like in such a small group, you must really know every person in that group. So it's almost like one-to-one tutoring with world's best scientists. I mean, that's clearly a big strength. Was that something that you intended part or just happened like that? Well, this is something that happened, I would say, but also it's partly the result of having dedicated administration people as well. And so this is something that I also would like to stress. I mean, when people think about an educational program, they often think about the academics and the students. But we also have a very strong admin team taking care of many practical things. Housing is a difficult one. Visa issues have not become easier over the years. And so what is really intended is that we keep a very low threshold between ourselves and the student. And that's very much appreciated. threshold between ourselves and the student. And that's very much appreciated. Of course, I mean, if we had 10 times as many students, then we wouldn't be able to remember all the names and we would not know everybody personally. So in that sense, you could say it's not intended because there is a big need for fire safety engineers. I'm sure that if 10 times more people would graduate, then still everybody would easily find a job somewhere in the field. So in that sense, it's not intended, but given the circumstances, certainly it is intended. We want to have as personal contact as possible and as desired. I'm not a lecturer, but I had an episode a year ago. I was giving a course on compartment fires in the main school in USA, and I had the completely opposite experience, because in Poland Poland every fire officer goes through fire safety engineering course. So there would be 200 people attending a lecture on Microsoft Teams. None of them would have a camera on. Five at least would be eating their dinner, which I had. So it's a completely different... I'm not saying it's bad. It's more like mass production and you're crafting more. Yeah, yeah. Well, indeed. It's not necessarily a matter of good or bad indeed because I'm also teaching courses at Guernsey University for more than 100 students and the only time you really see them in person is during the exam. And then you realize how many there are. Otherwise there's always at least 10, 15 meters of distance in between. They wouldn't always come to class. So, indeed, I mean, this is just a different situation. This is quite specific for the IMFSE program, I would say, that also students entering the program are all very, very interested in all courses. I mean, I have a background in mechanical engineering, and with all due respect to my former professors, I did not enjoy every course equally because it's a wide field. Fire safety engineering is quite well defined. I mean, it's still more than enough to spend two years studying the different aspects. But still, every course is quite closely connected to fire safety science or fire safety engineering. And that is also a big advantage, that you have very few students who become uninterested in a certain class. And that stimulates also the personal relationship. Otherwise, people would hide. If they're not interested in your course, they would prefer to be in a large group. What qualities do you seek when recruiting for IMFSC? Like what makes a candidate the perfect match for the program? We have an online application form and that's the first step. And I personally do the screening of all the application files coming in. And aspects that are important are, of course, the background studies, so what have they studied before, and the grades. I mean, we also look at the grades as, say, one of the, let's say, signs of not necessarily intelligence, but also perseverance. So we're looking at grades. We look at maybe professional experience that they already have or not. That's not a bottleneck per se, but it helps if you have already some professional experience successful. Motivation letter is important to see what they mentioned there. We also ask for recommendation letters at least two. And language is also, that's a criterion. It's imposed by university. They need to have a certain minimum requirement, but it's also just essential to be able to follow the classes. If the language is already a barrier, then it's very difficult to transfer technical knowledge as well. We're talking English, right? Yes, yes, yes. We're talking English here. But that's step one. And then let's say the top 50 to 60 are interviewed by one person of the management board. So each management board member interviews about 15 applicants. And then we come to the short list for the scholarships. And so, I mean, what's the ideal match? There is no such thing as the ideal match, I would say. But in general, a student or an applicant that scores well at all aspects, including the interview, those would be the ones that we would offer a scholarship. But another outcome would be, yes, you are admitted into the program. We think you're qualified. But unfortunately, and due to the heavy competition, we cannot offer you a scholarship. And then such students can still come on a self-sponsored basis, of course. Are the criteria for the prospective wildfire scientists the same, Ilalia? Are you looking the same in people? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All the students are mostly selected because they are highly motivated in the field of fire science, let's say, and fire safety. And I wouldn't say there is another aspect you should ask for them to qualify to study wildfire science. All of them will be qualified. All of them will be qualified. It's the same things that make someone a great builder environment, fire engineer and wildfire urban interface. I wonder how do your students come into IMFSC? If I'm honest about my past, I've came to fire by accident. There was like one in third chance I will be a chemical engineer, a pharmacist, or a fire engineer. The fate brought me down in here so I can talk with magnificent people like you. Maybe I would be very good at making drugs if I picked another path. So I'm not sure, but I'm here. But it honestly was by accident. And many people I know in fire industry, they either had a relative in fire engineering or just saw a poster with the flames on someone's wall and just say, oh, that's a career path. I didn't know that. How is it for IMFSE students? Do they come and say, oh, I want to be a fire engineer. This is my course. Yeah. Well, it's interesting that you mentioned yourself, Wojciech. I'll take the liberty of doing that as well. Now talking about myself. I also ended up in fire almost by accident because I'm a mechanical engineer in background, and my PhD was on turbulent combustion with flames, and it's actually flames were the link to fire at some point in my career. But now I must say when we look at the applicants trying to enter our program, most of them are indeed really focused on fire safety engineering. So in their motivation letter, they explain why. Very often it's because they've witnessed an incident in their country and realized that there is lack of, let's say, well-thought standardized legislation sometimes, and that's often what motivates them. Or they are already professionally active and are responsible for fire safety projects in their in their company and they would like to learn more of the background so i would say that yes most of them are really dedicated to the field of fire safety engineering not by accident ulali i wonder in countries like like spain which doesn't have a program well now it has but it didn't have a fire safety engineering program. Would you say it's the same like well-thought motivation or I really wonder what's the mindset? Yeah, well, in that case, most of the students came to the field by chance, let's say, somehow. Except those already related to the field like firefighters sometimes firefighters want to learn more and then they they are already motivated and they know very well what they are searching for but right now in our country very few people know about the field of fire safety engineering really because or they go to work in a company and then they need to do projects related to fire safety engineering. Then they realize that, well, that's something they like and they want to learn more and take further studies on this. That's a shame because if students knew you can set fire to things and get paid for that, who would not take that? Seriously. Outside of jokes, I think a pathway where someone is a firefighter has experienced this firsthand. As we like to say, they felt the heat. It gives you a completely different not even understanding, it gives you a completely different respect to what we're doing. Because in the end, it's a curriculum that is meant to save lives. And it's also an important thing. And again, we go back to the mindset that you have mentioned about. Answer it honestly. Would you rather pick someone with extremely good notes and bland personality or someone overly enthusiastic and, let's say, not the greatest of the great. I mean, in this procedure, you should not underestimate the importance of the interview. And obviously, I mean, the interview is still, I mean, it's still one moment in somebody's life. You can have a good day. You can have a bad day. We should appreciate that. But still, you know, after 15, 20 minutes of talking, you get some sense of who you are dealing with. And, you know, what I find very difficult to deal with is very arrogant people. Arrogance, you often notice within the first five minutes. And if not, then within the first 10 minutes. That, to me, is really like a negative sign. 10 minutes, that to me is really like a negative sign. So even if it's somebody with very high grades and the perfect background, already during the interview, it was very difficult behavior. That would be a no-go. Vice versa happens less often, I would say. I mean, if somebody did not really have a very strong file, they would not make it to the interview. But then maybe I should explain it a bit better. And so we first make a short list of people to be interviewed. But another outcome could be, look, based on your file, and we think you might qualify for the program, so if you're interested to come on a self-sponsored basis, then please let us know. And then still, also, those people are interviewed, because we really think the group dynamics is very important and it's easy to kill group dynamics by one or two difficult people. So we try to filter that out as much as we can. I've claimed that on the show in here and had a full episode about it. I think communication skills are the most important skills of fire scientists, like the one that is thrown into the industry and has to work out you know talking with so many stakeholders each of them with different background different understanding having to communicate the same thoughts in five different levels of complication and achieve success on all of these five levels so so it's uh certainly you know the soft skills may be more important than ability to understand the differential equation at some point. I'm pretty convinced that that would be the case. Now, as you mentioned industry, I know IMFSE has fantastic industrial partners. How does that collaboration work with the partners outside of academia for IMFSE? And to what extent it's important for you? Oh, it's very important. One, wanting the money, of course, is important. That helps to let the engine run. But it also gives us what I call street credibility. If you have good industry partners, then also the students realize that we are delivering also good quality alumni. Otherwise, the industry would not support us. The students realize that we are delivering also good quality alumni. Otherwise, the industry would not support us. Collaboration is also quite easy in the sense that we have very regular communication with them. We facilitate internships with these companies. They can offer a master dissertation topic each year. offer a master dissertation topic each year. But at the same time, while we listen to their input and feedback, they respect that we make the final academic decisions, so there is no interference at that level. And what's also important is that the contributions that they give in terms of money are not earmarked to a single person. So it's collected by ourselves, and we as a management board decide to also grant scholarships to let's say talented applicants that did not receive a scholarship from the European Commission. So that facilitates many discussions. There's no discussion of oh you really gave the money to a poor student or oh that company had a better student than we did. Those discussions are avoided. Just for clarification, the scholarship covers the tuition and living costs as well? Yes. Well, it depends a bit. So the European scholarships, the ones that we get from the European Commission, yes, it covers both. Some scholarships that we grant as management boards also cover both and sometimes we only offer a tuition fee waiver. Okay. So that depends a bit on the amount of money that we have, but also the level and the number of high-level applicants. Eulalia, at Catalonia, did you already develop a relation with industry? I'm not even sure if industry for wildfire urban interface exists, because I think that would be governmental. But I guess that's also an interesting place to see collaborators, right? Yeah, well, as I mentioned before, we have a strong relationship with a cluster of companies related to the fire safety engineer. So although we are more focused on industrial risks, let's say, and fires, We are more focused on industrial grease, let's say, and fires. We also have done quite a lot of work in fire protection engineering. So we have, let's say, that good relationship with several companies. We are now in the process of engaging them as collaborators for the IMFSC. And I really think there will be more because, as I said, there's a strong need here for professionals in the fire safety engineering domain and also to try to develop new things in contact with the university. So I think the IMFSC is a good place to do that. So yeah, I think we have a good future in here. Maryland, University of Science and Technology of China, and I guess now Polytechnic University of Catalonia has advanced to the full partner. So there seems to be four associated partners now. What's the role of these institutions? They take care of one master's dissertation topic each year. So they're not involved in teaching courses at this stage. Again, also to make things manageable and also to avoid monetary discussions also with the associated partners. The students are kind of like exchange students from their sides, and so within the IMFSE program, they would spend the final semester with them. The final is fourth or third? Fourth, yes. Okay. So that would be like a six-month period, all in all, that they would spend at one of the associated partner institutions. So let's go through it once again. You start at Gantt or Edinburgh, you learn the basics, the fundamental, fire, safety. You basically catch up, structural engineers catch up to thermodynamics of mechanical engineers, mechanical engineers learn how to calculate inertia or stuff for structures. And then they go Lund. So they learn risk. They learn human behavior. They attend the fantastic laboratories of Lund. Then they spread around the world for their final semester. And then the fourth one, they focus on their master dissertation in the institution they've chosen, at which they can write it. Did I get that correctly? No, no. In the third semester, they go to either Ghent or UPC. Ah, Ghent or UPC. Okay. So the third semester is then the advanced fire protection and also wildfires and industrial protection. And then the fourth semester is then one of the full partner universities or one of the associated partner universities. Now I understand. So the groups are not like one fourth of the year. They're like a half of the year. Yes, yes. That makes it more manageable. I really wonder if you end up with a group of six people. I mean, it's great that you do that, but that's a huge effort, yeah. No, no, no. So the groups are about, let's say, on average, also including local master programs, would be 15, 20 students in each class at each moment in time. Very, very interesting. Okay, now let's touch the final part of the course, the master thesis. I've seen some of them. They usually are very, very good. I mean, you see them published in 570 journal in different places they're like really really good pieces of research for an undergraduate so how do you find the topic like how do you get this level of science out of students I mean these guys and girls are just students you would not expect them being able to write a 570 Journal paper straight out of their head. One out of 30 could, maybe. You get them very consistent at writing good papers, so there must be a secret in there. What do you feed them? Well, you talked about this list of pubs. But on a more serious, no jokes aside, I think it's again, it's a little bit of a mix. So there is a list of topics that each institute would provide. So the academics would provide the topic and then students can pick one of those topics. The same holds, as I said before, for the companies from the consortium that support us. So they can also offer a topic, which is also then added to the list. And the same holds for associated partner universities. But on top of that, students can also define their own topic. Of course, that also requires a number of iterations, because sometimes students are a little bit too optimistic or too ambitious, and both ways can happen, so it's important. Welcome to fire science. Yeah. But it's important to start from a well-defined topic. That's, I think, the basic of each successful master's dissertation. And then, well, what do we do? We do train them quite strongly during the studies in understanding the science in depth. So not only broadly, but also in depth. in depth, so not only broadly, but also in depth. So I think that is a key difference, let's say, to distinguish between a top student and a less top student. Of course, it would only be the top students who would, in the end, be capable of writing a paper for a scientific journal or a technology or whatever journal. And I think it's that plus the fact that they can then also have one semester really focused to their master dissertation. And they're not distracted by courses, which also gives them responsibility and puts some pressure perhaps also on them, because they cannot hide behind exams throughout a course or assignments that they have to finish. So I think that that creates, I would also call it perhaps some seriousness during the final semester that students go full speed and fully focused on their dissertation. But let's imagine someone wants to go to Queensland and write a paper or master thesis about bushfires. To what extent they have access to Eulalia and their knowledge base? Do you still oversee these guys? Yeah, yeah. So allow me to reply to Eulalia. We always have, if a student has a master's dissertation with an associated partner, there is also always one academic supervisor at one of the two partner universities. The joint degree is signed by, now at this point, four full partner universities. And so that means that one of us has to take academic responsibility, which is perfectly possible and even plausible, I would say. If students were to go to Queensland to do a master's dissertation on wildfires, that Eulalia or a colleague at UPC would be involved as academic supervisor on behalf of IMFSC. And so, indeed, there would be an automatic interaction with the colleague at UPC for that topic. So that goes very natural, I would say. That's the way it usually goes at IMFSC, and now with UPC it would be exactly the same. And when there is a research topic probably in the field of wildland fires, probably we will use the IMFSC reference. And that's also perhaps one of the things that online tools facilitate is significant. If you compare that to 5 to 10 years ago, let's say the early days of IMFSC, then I just as an anecdote, I remember traveling to Zurich to ETH to just check on the students, doing a lot of dissertation there on how things were going. And everything was perfectly fine, as I had hoped and expected. But still, now it would be much easier. Like, oh, can we do an online meeting? And then you could do that on a regular basis. Yeah, the world became a much, much smaller place after the pandemic. And I see a lot of, like, if we're on, you know, expanding the model, I think this online world presents a lot of opportunities to expand. Like, it will be very brutally hard for anyone to replicate MFSC. First, you would have to obtain the European funding and stuff. So I don't think it would be even possible at this point having one program of this scale. However, we see some very interesting efforts like PyroLife happening with PhDs and MSCA action that granted, like, I think it was 16, even 18 PhDs in that field. That's one more thing. If someone, because many of the students will go into industry, many of them will like to be a part of academia. What are the academic prospects for your graduates? Well, you know, academia as well as we do. So it's a world where there are, I would say, very regularly opportunities if you are accepting to be at any place on this planet. So if you're open to traveling, then this is an opportunity. As you say, I mean, we have quite a fraction of our graduates doing a PhD. It's in between 15 to 20 percent, which is quite a high number. It's high, yeah. I would say. And many of them go with one of the partner institutes of INFSE, but certainly not all. I mean, many students also going to different places. And one of the assets that they have gained is once you've spent two years away from home and you've managed to settle there, you can live almost anywhere on this planet and find your way. And so they're very flexible in terms of living, I would say. So are the opportunities there? Sure. But for that, I mean, if you look at now at academia, as you all know, it takes a while to find your way there and to become permanent staff. So most of our alumni are not yet at that stage, and we're a bit too young as a program for that. But many of them already have obtained a PhD and some selective in academia. Yeah, I think it's hard to extract one secret, but you really have a nice individual approach to people. I mean, you treat people well and you have nice people. And that seems to be a very big part of the success story there. And the ability to really expose young students to really world's best scientists within a very well-defined curriculum. Like looking at that from this perspective can go bad. Yeah, now that you mentioned Wojciech treating people well, I think, I mean, it's been a clear trend, and I think it's a good trend then to have more attention for DEI aspects and diversity, equity, inclusion. But I think we had this from the start in IMFSC, and I think that also kind of pays off quite significantly. Also, again, going back to the communication skills, I think that's also part of it, that you treat everybody with mutual respect and understanding. And this, I mean, we're talking here soft skills now, clearly, but it's something that we put really in the center of our values from start with IMFSE. I think, indeed, I mean, it kind of also connects to what you said, like alumni feeling part of a family. I think that's indeed more or less the feeling that is created. I wanted to ask you a question, why Masters? Why not Bachelors or something? But I think now I understand it's self-explanable. why not bachelors or something but I think now I understand it's self explainable you need people with a certain background but it's kind of beautiful that you make structural engineers mechanical engineers, chemical engineers all together because then they can you know level up to the same level on their own just by being exposed to each other. Structural engineer will help the chemical one, the chemical one will help them chemistry. It's a really great way to build a common base and then proceeding through a very difficult subject of fire dynamics from the same level. But it does require some maturity. So that's indeed also why master's level and not bachelor, you can expect that of someone in their 20s and someone perhaps certainly with some professional experience already. That's, by the way, also something that we try to strive for, that there is some spreading in age in each cohort and experience. But indeed, you cannot expect that if you put together 20 18-year-old people, that you have a different dynamics. Interesting dynamics, surely, but the different dynamics that we do not cover at this point. And just a final one. How many make it through? Like, what's the statistic? I would shoot it's upwards of 85%, maybe even upwards of 90%. Yeah, it's more. And so, indeed, I mean, we have very few dropouts. If we have a dropout, it's very often due to personal circumstances, but very rarely because of lack of competence or knowledge. And that's a little bit the luxury, of course, of having a few hundred applicants, and then in the end, only 20 make it to 2025-30 now, this year, and make it into the program, yes, then unless you don't do a good job during the selection procedure, the ones that are accepted into the program have a good chance of being successful. That combination of screening and interviews turns out to be a fairly effective way of filtering good candidates. Fantastic. So the most important question, where does one apply? Ah, on the website. So imfsc.com, imfsc.be, all these links to the same website and the application forms are online now for the upcoming academic year. Is there a separate application process for the scholarship-based and non-scholarship? No, but you can, by default we assume that you are interested in a scholarship. Okay, yeah, that's a reasonable assumption. But yeah, you can indicate that if you really don't need it, that can be indicated as well, but it doesn't change the quality check. So we are not more tolerant for somebody who's bringing a bag of money, because that doesn't help anyone. It only leads to a lot of frustration for all parties involved. It's much better to try to avoid that before entering than once they are in the program. Very good. And I guess if someone says they're a religious listener of Fireside Show, they definitely will score a lot of points at the interview. So I hope for that. OK, Bart, thank you very much for coming and talking about the origins and the concept. Lalia, thank you for telling us about the future and the new opening of the program. telling us about the future and the new opening of the program. And I hope this will be useful to people who would first like to understand what makes a fire safety engineer well-trained and how to replicate the success story elsewhere. And boy, I need to jump into that beautiful paper now. Thanks to you. How could I miss it? What was I doing in 1995? I better not tell. Anyway, thank you very much for the invitation, Bocek. It was a pleasure being here, and thanks for the interview. Thank you very much, Bocek. It was a pleasure, and it's a nice initiative, those courses. Please recommend it to all the students. My statistics it to all the students. My statistics will go through the roof. Anyway, guys, thank you so much and see you around. Take care, Wojciech. Bye-bye. And that's it. Wow, what a program. What a nice group of people. I wanted to extract the secret of IMFSE, but I'm not sure if there exists one secret. I guess it was mentioned in the episode. There's probably many. First thing first, treat people well. Work with nice people. That certainly helps with developing a great, great safe, high-security program. Second thing, build this mentorship relation where people can learn and have highly motivated people to learn. If you have highly motivated people and you have highly motivated teachers, this cannot go wrong. They will transfuse the knowledge for sure. Third thing, open yourself to diversity. The program has participants from 80 countries. That's a very diverse group and each of them brings something new, something unique. You know, even when they start learning about their own country legislation systems, they are so different. Such a difference in approaches to fire safety. It's beautiful to learn from each other that. And that certainly helps to build this holistic view over what fire safety engineering truly is. And fourth thing, I don't think we talked about that much in the podcast episode, but I know they learn through experiment. They touch the fire. They really do observe the fire. It's not just bland, sit at the desk, read the handbook, open FDS, run a simulation, you're done. It's a very, very active program where they really get a chance to know FHIR. And by experiencing FHIR, you become a better FHIR engineer. You cannot learn experience, you have to experience experience, like I like to say. And there's a lot of these nice things about the program, and all together, they make it one of the best, or maybe even the best in the world, for sure. So thank you, Bart. Thank you, Alalia, for joining me in this episode. I wish you all the best for the IMFSC. I wish all the best to IMFSC students, and I hope that among the audience there are some new people who would like to be IMFSC family members. The path is open. You just need to apply. And as Bart said, there's other points for listening to Fireside Show. So make sure to make that claim and it will help you in the interview. So, guys, that's it for today. Thank you very much for being here with me. And see you here again next Wednesday. Thank you. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
