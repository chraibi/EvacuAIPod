 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to interview Professor David Purser, the renowned expert in the field of toxicology and toxicity in fires, and this year's recipient of the Emmons Plenary Lecture at the FSS Symposium in Tsukuba, perhaps the highest honor a fire scientist can get. With David we digged quite a deep jump into toxicity of fires and why fires are toxic. And I've promised you there's more coming. So here we go. Here is more. This time, I've asked some questions about how do we know what's produced in the fires, how do we measure that, and what actually is driving this production. I've asked about the material properties and the ventilation, the burning conditions in which the burning occurs, and we ended up with quite a deep and interesting conversation that you're just about to hear. As in the previous episodes with David, by the way, I would highly recommend listening to those first to give you a basic idea about toxicology and fires. But if you've missed those episodes, you're very welcome to listen to this one and then move back if you enjoy this. As with all the episodes on this particular very difficult subject, I understand these are not easy. There's a lot of chemistry. Not many people love chemistry. We tend to remove it from fire safety engineering as often as we can. I guess there's not that many chemistry enthusiasts around in here. But yeah, this is fundamental to our understanding of why fires are dangerous, when they are dangerous, how do we act on that, and what's generally happening in compartment fires. So I believe very important lessons in here, lessons that are difficult to find elsewhere, not that many great resources on this subject that you can easily learn from, so I hope you will still enjoy it. I've enjoyed it a lot. I don't know what that means about me, but I've certainly loved talking to David. Anyway, let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode.

I appreciate that a lot. But you've left me hanging. You left me on a cliffhanger the last interview. So we really have finished this. Today, I would love to understand how smoke and toxic products in smoke are produced in fire. And just let me give you a brief introduction of how I model that in my CFD. And that's going to take me two sentences. how I model that in my CFD, and that's going to take me two sentences. I take heat release rate that my fire emits. I know the mass, the heat of combustion of that, so I know the mass loss rate of my fuel. And then I apply the soothill or CO yield to that. And I know how much I've emitted environment. So how good approximation that can be given the complexity of fire physics? of toxic product in each cell or area of your analysis. The question is, where do you get the data from? The CFD combustion model does give you some information in the sense that it tells you what the major species are. So it tells you how much unburned fuel there is in that cell, how much carbon dioxide there is, and how much oxygen you consumed and the temperature. So you've got a sort of very basic combustion model in each cell. But I think beyond that, when it to what cfd people call minor species like which is all the ones i'm interested in like carbon monoxide and polyaromatic carbons and all these things toxic species the models still got some way to go and i know they are still working on this so i suppose the sort of approach that i would suggest is that you then, having got the basic conditions in the combustion conditions with the CFD analysis, and the mass loss fuel concentration or effluent concentration in the analysis, you can then go and look up the empirical yields that people have measured in various kinds of test apparatus. If you know what the fuel is, you have to know what the fuel is, the fuel mix is that you're burning of course, what's been measured for that fuel under defined conditions and I'm going to come back to the defined conditions in a minute. I think that I'm not jumping ahead a bit really but what we tried to achieve in the work we were doing because we realized that the yields of all these toxic products varied so much. It was different materials under different combustion conditions and this sort of thing. We wanted to find a test method where we could decompose or combust the material under defined conditions and with fixing three or four major parameters that determined the products that were formed. Essentially the temperature, whether or not the material is flaming with a flame or not, or smoldering, and particularly the fuel-air equivalence ratio. And then we could plot the yields of all the toxic products against those parameters, defined with those parameters. If you then took those parameters and looked for them in full-scale fire tests, compartment fire tests, or in other types of apparatus that were trying to achieve the same thing, did you get the same answer? In other words, when we measured something in a small-scale test under these defined conditions, was it predictive of what you get in all other kinds of apparatus or burning things under those same conditions? And ultimately I think, and there's a lot more work needs being done on this of course but ultimately i think we're getting somewhere you know i think we we sort of more or less have achieved so i think there's i think that's a promising approach to take so at the moment that's i mean i know there are there are complex combustion models that some people use in conjunction with cft but i think at the moment a good way is to use the sort of expressions that we've been developing. Well, I've been fitting Weibull curves, you know, to my yield data, which are defined in terms of equivalence ratio, things like that. So you could take those expressions, hard-to-break expressions, apply them to the computed conditions in your CFD cells. Yeah, local conditions in your, yeah. And use that to make the likely concentrations and yields of the minor species that you're going to get for your particular fuel mix. It's just the beginning of the interview and I'm already at an intersection because I don't know if I want to learn more about the materials or the testing conditions now. But let's try materials because it's something that we also touched on in the previous episode. Well, just to finish where I was going with this, that's the sort of way I would like to have gone if I hadn't retired and got involved in all the things. And I went some way down that. For example, I worked on the Mont Blanc Tunnel fire investigation. Okay, tell me more. That's one of the few chances I've had in my career to work with my colleagues who were doing CFD analysis. Okay, tell me more about that. of incident and I was trying to do the toxicity analysis, the FED analysis for people who might be moving in the tunnel. And one way we did this was to use the CFD. So at that time, what we could do was really quite limited in terms of predicting minor species. So what we decided was looking at the scenarios they were getting with the CFD analysis, we felt that the conditions downstream of the main, of the first burning HGV, of the big vehicle that was burning, near the ceiling there, would have been initially not fully well ventilated, because it's a confined-ish sort of space and a very large fuel load, but it would be somewhat vitiated, somewhat underventilated. And we looked at the composition of the burning vehicle and its load, which was margarine, in fact. And based on the sort of data that we had from the Chivfurnas and other sources on ULs under certain equivalence ratio type conditions, we came up with an estimate of the sort of CO, cyanide, etc. yields we expected to get under those conditions. And used the CFD to work out the dilution factors and things and so came up with time concentration curves in the tunnel, along the tunnel, that we felt that the occupants would be lied to be exposed. And then from that, I was able to do some estimates of how far people would be able to walk through the tunnel before they would collapse based on the CFD analysis and FED analysis. Okay. walk through the tunnel before they would collapse based on the CFD analysis and FED analysis. Now in this particular incident we had another source of information which was that our French colleagues had worked out, they looked at the time each vehicle that got stuck in the tunnel entered the tunnel and how far they travelled so they were able to calculate the time at which those people stopped in the tunnel and we know how far they walked in the tunnel before they collapsed so we roughly knew at what time they collapsed and we could compare that with the predicted times based upon the cfd fed analysis if you're with me so you've got two ways of coming at the same thing and we found that there was a reasonably good agreement between the two in other words the data from the time of the measured, if you like, time of arrival and collapse of the people in the tunnel agreed with what we would predict if the CFD modeling was correct. And so this is a sort of approach I'm using quite a lot now to say that if we holistically take all these sources of information for an incident, can we use one to help validate another and arrive at a consensus understanding what's going on? And so that's one example where we have tried to apply yield data to a CFD analysis, but that aspect of it was really quite simple. I think we could do a lot better. But as far as I know, nobody's really run with this and try to do it be the greatest somebody would to summarize it briefly so you basically have a simulated the fire from which you had the major uh products yields that that would produce normally co2 soot and stuff you understood that the smoke layers under ventilated so you have applied more complex models to understand the yields in that underventilated layer. And based on your empirical research in comparable conditions, you got the yields of minor toxic pollutants like HCN and other more dangerous things. And then knowing the travel distance, you've calculated the doses that people took. Yeah. That's how we could do engineering, actually, because we do have some sort of evacuation models, though we don't really simulate behavior that much. I guess that's going to be a major limiting factor in estimating those, because you just assume a person walks away, not necessarily recalls the fire with their phone while inhaling smoke. Our models don't do that yet. But yeah, I see that being a path for the future. And I really like how you could, based on limited data from imperfect CFD, like major toxic yields, figure out reliable numbers for the minor toxic pollutants. That's very interesting. How much that is related to material? We've touched a little bit on that in the previous episode But maybe we can talk I think we've got to the end of the beginning I would like to go I think it's nice again to start with a little bit of history Please do So when I started to get involved in this in the early 70s And people were starting to look at years and amounts of toxic products And what toxic products are produced by burning materials. Everything was really quite primitive in the sense of our understanding of the combustion processes. So what inhalation toxicologists, I was an inhalation toxicologist at the time, what they like to do when they're talking really about fire chemistry but also animal experiments here, is that particularly for animal experiments, what you try to do is generate an atmosphere of some material. We would do this for all sorts of things, not just for fire, obviously, mainly for dust and gases and novel chemicals, industrial chemicals and things like this. What you try to do as well as you can is to generate an atmosphere in a chamber of some sort that will remain of constant composition for a defined time. And typically, a combustion toxicity test would be 30 minutes. Standard acute toxicity tests would tend to be standard international standards for a four-hour period. If somebody sends you a newly invented chemical that might be a dust that might be generated in the atmosphere, you would normally take groups of rats and expose them for four hours to different concentrations of that in the atmosphere. But you always try and make sure your atmosphere was steady state. Call it steady state atmosphere. So you put in the thing you're testing, you put it into the chamber at a constant rate and you dilute it with a constant stream of diluent air to get a defined concentration for the whole period of time. So when people started to first work on this with combustion products, I sort of get the impression that somebody came to them and said, look, we've got to do combustion. How are we going to do it? So I said, well, we need to find some way of generating this smoke atmosphere. And I'll go and have a look in the cupboard of the old lab at the end of the building and see what we've got. And they came up with all sorts of different bits of heating equipment. And I said, well, yeah, we can use this. We can stick our material here and it'll get hot enough or put it in this oven it'll start to decompose and we can see what it does or chemically the gcms we can see what chemicals are given off and so it was really done without too much thought about what actual conditions are we generating so when i when i first started working on this for the fire search station i was asked to look at three materials. Wood, so pine of sylvestris, just ordinary pine wood. Polypropylene. Polypropylene is a good place to start with our ideas because it's a polypropylene, polyethylene, it's about as simple as you can get in a solid material. It's just carbon and hydrogen in a long chain. And the third material was flexible polyurethane foam because that was a big issue and still is. And I was asked to test these under pyrolytic conditions, i.e. under nitrogen. Now I have to talk about what we mean by pyrolysis, right? Now to me, pyrolysis is when you heat your material under a stream of nitrogen, that you don't give it any oxygen. There's another term called non-flaming oxidative decomposition, or some people call that oxidative pyrolysis, which is where you heat up a specimen, a material, in air, but it's not burning with a flame. So it's non-flaming, but you heat it up to a temperature where it starts to pyrolyze and then oxidize. So with pyrolysis, you meant the composition that doesn't lead to flaming because there's no oxygen around it, yes? So it's like a... So pure pyrolysis, if you like, is where there's no oxygen supply, so it cannot oxidize and it cannot burn. Oxidative thermal decomposition, non-flaming, is where you're heating something up to a temperature where it doesn't auto-ignite. So it's just smoldering, might be smoldering, and that's a whole other area of complexity. What do we mean by smoldering? Which we could also talk about, a lot of what I've worried about over the years. What simple oxidative decomposition, there'd be no glow, you'd just be heating it up. You go up to a temperature where you've got pyrolysis. Pyrolysis just means the molecular structure of the material is breaking down due to heat. That's where things start off. On OCFD, people are very keen on pyrolysis rates. And the origin, the first step in pyrolysis is that heat is applied and it starts to break down the material. But once it starts to break down the material. But once it starts to break down, if there's any air around, you can get some degree of oxidation of those products. No flames yet, but you're starting at oxidation. And these distinctions are really quite important. So by the time I started doing my work, there were really two or three major sorts of apparatus around that people were using for this work. So the National Bureau of Standards had the NBS cup furnace method. And basically what they had was a 200 litre sealed box, perspex box with at one end underneath it they had a crucible with a volume of about 200-300 ml. And they actually did start to think a little bit about the combustion conditions. So the tests that they did, they put the samples of material into this, dropped them into this crucible at a temperature, I forget the exact amount, but it was a few 10 or 20 degrees or something below the auto-ignition temperature. So they're heating their material in air, but at a temperature where it will pyrolyze, may oxidize, but at a temperature where it will paralyze, may oxidize, but should not ignite. And then they would expose rats to that for half an hour. And in the standard test, you then keep the rats for 14 days afterwards, the ones that survive the immediate exposure, to see if any further toxic effects occur. So that's the standard toxicity approach. And then they would repeat the test at, I forget the figure now, but it's like 20 degrees, 10 or 20 degrees above the auto-ignition temperature. So in this case, the lecithin would ignite and burn with a flame, and you'd expose the animals to that. So you're already starting to get some kind of distinction between these two states of non-flaming and flaming. Another apparatus that was used quite widely and got some very interesting data from was the University of Pittsburgh. It's mostly in the States this is all going on. They used a sort of much larger sort of oven type situation where they took a specimen of material and they heated it with a ramp temperature profile. So it started at room temperature and then they increased the temperature with a ramp, linear ramp, and they got hotter and hotter and hotter and at some point it would start to pyrolise and then at a bit higher temperature it might ignite, but they didn't really report or detail what conditions they were getting, they would just use this as a protocol and then they would expose mice to that and you remember last time we were speaking about the mouse RD50 test their purpose of their test was particularly to measure the irritancy of the smoke using mice, but they also looked at lethal effects of carbon dioxide and stuff like that. And then the other main apparatus we could now come over from the United States to Europe was the DIN 53436 apparatus. And the DIN, these are all bench-scale tests, So the DIN test used a typical, I think it's called a Liebig furnace. It's a tube furnace. So they had a long tube about 600mm or quite a little exact length, but quite a long tube. About a metre long and about 25mm diameter. Just a simple furnace tube. But what they did, which was quite useful, was they had an annular furnace outside the tube so they could heat up the tube. But they had the annular furnace to move on a movement device. So they tested their material as a long strip. And they'd start the furnace at one end, and the furnace would move along the strip. And now we're starting to get a more constant decomposition rate. You see, because they're putting air through the furnace at one end and the furnace would move along the strip, then now we're starting to get a more constant decomposition rate. You see, because they're putting air through the tube at a constant rate, then they're decomposing the fuel at a constant rate as the heated furnace moves along the tube. It's doing successive plots of the specimen. And what comes out at the end then, it depends on the ratio of the mass loss of the strip of material and the air supply. So it's the fuel-air ratio. And it remains fairly constant for the duration of the test. Once you've got things up and running, it stays fairly constant. Because the flow is steady. The flow is constant, and the exposure rate of the fuel is constant. So the fuel ratio is constant. And so when I started my work, I started to use a variant of that approach. But because I didn't have that particular apparatus, I used a simpler version where I got a standard tube furnace about half a meter long, and a furnace tube to put in it, silica furnace tube in it, and then I put the specimen in a little ceramic boat of the long strip, and I pushed it in at a constant rate. So I'm achieving the same thing as Din. So I have a constant flow of air in so many litres or grams per minute, and I put the specimen into standard rate, so many grams per minute, so I've got a defined fuel-air ratio. And I said, when I first started doing this work, we were looking at pyrolysis under nitrogen. And that was quite easy to do. And we did it at three temperatures, 300 degrees, 600 degrees, and 900 degrees centigrade in the furnace. And it was fairly straightforward to do because there's no flames involved. So it's all fairly predictable. But I sort of hope I'm getting towards the question because what we found with this, and I'm exposing animals to this atmosphere as well as trying to measure the composition in simple terms, CO concentrations, cyanide concentrations, carbon dioxide and oxygen are the main parameters, but also smoke. Smoke, particular concentration and optical density. So what we found, when I decomposed polypropylene in a stream of nitrogen, what we got was a sort of hydrocarbon mist of liquid droplet, very fine particles. Sort of something you get with a theatrical smoke generator, in fact. And when I exposed animals to this mist, it was pretty well had no effect on them at all. There's no oxygen, so you couldn't make any carbon monoxide. There's no nitrogen, so you've got no cyanide, so there's no nasty fixing gases. And because there's no oxygen to oxidize the hydrocarbon coming off this, there's no irritants being formed. And so it's effectively a harmless, relatively harmless atmosphere. Now, at the same time as I was doing this, Professor Woolley and his colleagues, Peter Fardell, were doing GC mass spec analysis of these atmospheres. And what they find with polypropylene, and maybe everything else as well, in fact, was along, I think we talked about this a bit last time, along a series of chemicals. So if you think of the hydrocarbons, the fourth one you get is methane, CH4, and then you get CH2, ethane, ethylene, propane, hexane. You've got the series, right, until you get to octane and things like that. And they found all those. Unfortunately, they didn't get the methane and ethane because of the nature of the apparatus. They couldn't capture it. What they found was they got this long series of hydrocarbon fragments, which are basically fairly harmless. But the other thing they did find, and you get this more when there's oxygen around as well, is that you get cyclic products produced. So they've got cyclohexane and styrene, styrene monomer and things like that. And this is a process called ring cyclization, which is very important in fires. So basically, the way I explain to my students, in simple terms that I understand it, is that you think of a long aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. The chain bites its tail. I think the guy who discovered benzene dreamt about the snake spliting its tail. So you've got a ring formed. And to start with, the ring is called cyclohexane. So it's six carbon atoms with hydrogen, but there are no double bonds in it. And then you get sort of progressive condensation reactions between adjacent molecules of benzene. So you think of two molecules of benzene in the air joining together. And so these rings get bigger and bigger and bigger, and so you get polyaromatic hydrocarbons. And then those get even bigger, and they form smoke particles. And that's what smoke particles essentially are. They're plates of graphite or most of all, but they start off as these condensing ring structures. So what you've got then is this long chemical series from stuff like methane up to various types of aromatic hydrocarbons, finishing up with actual smoke particles, which are more or less pure carbon. They're just carbon. When you've got rid of all the hydrogen, you just end up with carbon rings, essentially. So that's what happens. Now then, later on I started to put some air down the furnace tube. Now our temperature's below the ignition point, so up to about 400 degrees C, something like that. So that's hot enough to get pyrolysis, so you start to break down the materials in the way I've described. But now you're able to get some oxidation reactions going on. And so you get a whole new set of products, which are partially oxidized hydrocarbons and aromatic materials, or aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. And so you start with things like formaldehyde, acrolin, which is an unsaturated aldehyde, krypton aldehyde, which is the next series. These materials are carcinogens, and they're also extremely irritant. You also get things like phenol and acetaldehyde and all these sorts of things. And Professor Woolley and his colleagues were measuring these in their GMC mass spectra. They would come up with these two sets of big ranges of hydrocarbon-type organic products, a sort of aliphatic set, non-oxidized set, and then an oxidized set. And the oxidized sets were getting worrying. They were quite toxic. I spent many weeks going through the thing called the R-TEX database, the Registry of Toxic Effects of Substances, trying to find out the toxic effects of some of these weird and wonderful organic products that were appearing in the spectra. And the basic, the bottom line is that they're one or two obvious ones that we know about that are important acutely as irritants or damaging to the lungs, and others that we know about with unknown carcinogens and things like that. But a lot we don't know much about at all. And in later experiments, I exposed mice to some of these atmospheres. I'm looking at the irritancy now. And I tried to get some GCMS work done at the same time as I'm exposing the mice. So can I correlate the known atmosphere composition in terms of known irritant chemicals to the objective reduction in breathing in the mice? And the answer was yes and no. So if you produce an atmosphere like pluralized polypropylene, which you've got no irritants in, then the mice aren't affected. But as soon as you put oxygen in there and you get these oxidized compounds, they react very strongly. They find that atmosphere extremely irritant. But the potency of the irritancy in terms of the mass you need to produce it is minute. In other words, it's much, much the amount you need to decompose to get the concentration, mass loss concentration that caused a 50% decrease in breathing in the mice was tiny compared to the amount of the known products that are in there. In other words, most of the observed irritant effects could not be accounted for by what we could measure in the atmosphere. And that's still the case today. We still don't really know exactly what's going on there. So it's quite a complex situation. So in your experiments, starting with like thermal decomposition in nitrate of polypropylene, you had this, you basically had a mist of polypropylene that was released from the mold. Polypropylene peroxide products, yeah. Then eventually you've ended up adding oxygen to the mix, then started observing how those particles start to react with the oxygen in the atmosphere. Not yet enough to create flaming combustion, but enough to do some oxidation of these materials to then produce a whole new set of products that were previously unseen. And we're still talking about the same plastic material being in the tube that is polypropylene. Did you go all the way up to exposing mice to products of combustion of polypropylene, like fully burning it? Well, that's right. When I decompose wood, because wood has got only 50% carbon, roughly, there's a lot of oxygen in wood itself. So even when you decompose it under nitrogen, you still get oxidized products from wood. And that was quite, the wood smoke was very irritant, even under pyrolytic conditions. And then we looked at urethanes. And then, of course, that's much more complicated because polyurethane, when you heat it, breaks down into its two main components, which are a long-chain polyol, alcohol, long-chain alcohol, which stays in the furnace as a sort of brown liquid. alcohol which stays in the furnace as a sort of brown liquid and the itoluene diisocyanate the isocyanate component which comes up off as a vapor and then reacts with itself to form a kind of particulate smoke it's called yellow smoke which is highly irritant so we were getting all these kind of things going on so we're getting a feel for what's going on but of course the elephant in the room as it were here is that nearly all fires that kill people, in fact, I would say all fires that kill, really, that kill people, are flaming fires. Now, that's not to say that people aren't exposed to smouldering and non-flaming situations, which can be hazardous, but the bottom line is that nearly all the situations where you get smouldering or non-flaming, it's a very, very slow process. And hopefully the effluents that come off during smouldering will be picked up by some detector or somebody will smell it or become aware. And there's plenty of time to escape. So I don't think many people become seriously injured or killed in non-flaming fires, following fires. Most people certainly die in flaming fires because they grow so quickly, and the mass loss rate is exponential, and you can very quickly get to very bad conditions in a flaming fire. So what we really need to look at if we want to understand hazards to people is flaming conditions. So we started to move on to flaming conditions. And what we found there was, as soon as I burnt things with a flame, of course, all these pyrolysis products are combusted in the flame. And if you've got efficient combustion, they're all burnt up. And then the atmosphere becomes non-irritant by quite a large factor of 10 or even 100. So if it's got no halogens or anything in it like that, then the question comes in, what does flaming do to the yields that you're going to get in these atmospheres? Well, moving on as we got more into this, we started to realize, it's fairly obvious especially now, that the fuel air ratio of the combustion, combustion conditions, vary the products that you get. So if you bump, we identified something that we called well-ventilated flaming, where you get mostly carbon dioxide, water, and heat from a simple polymer or wood-type material, and you don't really get a little bit of smoke, particulates, which are fairly benign. You know, the sort of smoke you get off from well-ventilated wood, if you go and look at deposits after the event, you find it's a very dry, dusty particulate. Whereas when you burn things under ventilated conditions, and you look at the smoke that's deposited from that, it's sticky, oily, nasty stuff. So anyway, so we've got well-ventilated flaming, which is very efficient, can be very efficient, and relatively low toxicity in terms of atmospheres. And we're talking about one thing that we used to define things in terms of was the CO2-CO volume ratio, or some engineers like to use it the other way. So in a well-ventilated fire, CO2 concentration divided by CO concentration, molar fraction, is going to be something like 100. You get hardly any CO and lots of carbon dioxide. So one particle of CO per 100 of CO2, more or less. Yeah, one molecule. particle of CO per hundred of CO2, more or less. Yeah, one molecule. Then start to restrict the ventilation, and then that ratio starts to drop. In component size, in this test, it can get down to almost parity. Well, it usually down, I think about the most vitiated, where you can actually sustain a flame, it's usually about, I don't know, three or four to one CO2 divided by CO. And you're getting carbon monoxide yields of 0.2 gram per gram mass loss, fuel mass loss. That's kind of extraordinary. So we started to think about these under-ventilated fires and measure the composition of these kind of atmospheres. And we ended up putting this into ISO quite a lot with saying, well, if you want to look at toxicity of your atmospheres and we ended up putting this into iso quite a lot with saying well if you want to look at toxicity of your atmospheres you need to consider three or four basic fire types so one type would be um non-flaming oxidative decomposition so when something is being decomposed but it hasn't ignited another scenario is where you've got a small, relatively small, but well-ventilated fire. So a pre-flashover, well-ventilated fire kind of condition. And the third main sort of condition would be something approaching flashover, where you've got maybe fairly high compartment temperatures, 800, 900 centigrade in the upper layer, something like that. These fires in compartment fires in real buildings tend to be underventilated because when something goes to flash over in a room with limited ventilation, you're involving a huge fuel mass. So you tend to get a very high fuel content in your atmosphere. And so we thought of post-flashover fires as being typically underventilated fires. being typically under-ventilated fires. But that's something that there's been some arguments about, if you like. Can you have such a thing as a well-ventilated post-flashover fire? We thought about you could get various degrees of under-ventilation in a post-flashover fire. And you could also get small under-ventilated fires. So with a small-scale fire, where you don't have high upper-layer temperatures in particular, you can have one small item of burning like an armchair in a room, and you can get quite under-ventilated conditions there. So there's a whole range of different conditions you can get, and we really need to get a handle on what these conditions do to yield. And it's round about that point that I was introduced to the concept of equivalence ratio, which I think maps onto mixture fraction to some extent as a way of handling it in CFD. Is that right? So I think it was Vito Brabouskas who first introduced me to the idea of equivalence ratio. And I started to look at the papers by Pitts and people like that on global equivalence ratio and plume equivalence ratio. And of course, I then started to look at Archie Teweson's wonderful body of work. And he was using a small scale or varying scale apparatus, the ASTM apparatus. One second. Let's introduce the listeners. If someone is not familiar with the concept of equivalence ratio, basically if you have any combustion happening, there is a perfect ratio of fuel to oxygen, a stoichiometric ratio at which you have the most perfect condition. And there are plenty of different conditions in which the materials can burn. And we often define them by the ratio of fuel to air, which is the equivalence ratio. Did I get it correct? to air, which is the equivalence ratio. Did I get it correct? Yeah, so simply speaking, equivalence ratio is the actual fuel concentration divided by the actual air ratio in your test as a function of the stoichiometric fuel-air ratio, which is the ratio of fuel, whether it's just exactly the right amount of air to completely combust the fuel. So, put it simply, if your equivalence ratio is 1, that means that in your particular test you have stoichiometric conditions, you have exactly the right amount of air to burn the fuel that you've got in your atmosphere. If you have an equivalence ratio of 0.1, which is what happens in early stages of fire sometimes, then you've got a real big excess of air. So you've got 10 times as much oxygen as you need to burn your fuel. And if you've got an equivalent ratio greater than one, then you haven't got enough air to burn the fuel, and those are the under-ventilated conditions that we get in many certain stages of many components of fire. But we are still within the flammability limit, so it still can combust. It's just not as effective as if it was in the stoichiometric conditions, right? Yes, so that's the point. So in my apparatus, I was able to get up to equivalence ratios of about three and still support a flame. But I noticed in Tewesson's, if you read his chapter in the SFP handbook where he's got all his data, And Tuison, if you read his chapter in the SFP handbook where he's got all his data, he goes a bit beyond that. He goes into the zone where you've got maybe four or five to one. But as far as I can see, he's getting non-flaming conditions then. So he still thinks that the equivalence ratio has some relevance. Well, he's under conditions there where the flame will have extinguished. So it's not actually burning with a flame. And that limit may vary a bit depending on your apparatus, but essentially, in large-scale compartment fires tests that I've done, we're usually in the well below three. If you're getting up into that sort of area, then your fires like to self-extinguish in most cases. So the interesting zone is from point.1 up to 1, and then up to about 2.5 to 3 quilliams ratio is the interesting band, if you like, in real fire conditions. And I do commend you to look at Artie's work. So in Artie's work, he used a different sort of apparatus to me. He used a flat plate specimen placed inside a vertical cylindrical tube, glass tube, and then he irradiated it from outside with a halogen heat source. And his specimen is on the load cell, and he controls the air going up the tube, so he collects the effluent up the top. So it's quite a nice piece of apparatus. I was forgetting the figure, 2805 or something. 2805. YesSTM. Anyway, you're looking too fast. You're Wikipedia, walking Wikipedia for fire, thank you. Yeah. Looking up. It's the ASTM E2058 apparatus. That's his apparatus. So by varying the, controlling the air, so he knows the mass of air he's introducing, and he's not controlling the air, so he knows the mass of air he's introducing, and he's not controlling the mass of fuel, but he's measuring the mass loss rate of fuel. So he knows the mass loss rate with time, and therefore knows the ratio of the two. And he's got some lovely plots and data in his chapter. What he found was that when you decompose things, and I've found exactly the same thing in my apparatus, when you decompose things under well-ventilated conditions of phi less than one, then you get very low yields of carbon monoxide and these products of inefficient combustion is what we're talking about. You mostly get carbon, but you get high, very high yields, stoichiometric yields sometimes of carbon dioxide, and you get some water and heat and then as as you increase the equivalence ratio in separate runs i do minus in my operates each each equivalence ratio is maintained for one furnace test run so as you increase the equivalence ratio nothing much changes until you get start to approach an equivalence ratio of one. So as you get to near stoichiometric conditions, then you start to see some signs of inefficient combustion. So you get more smoke particles, you get more carbon monoxide. And one of the things I can do with my apparatus is do a complete, if you like, recovery and accounting of the fate of the fuel, because we know what the fuel composition is. And so what we can calculate is the total unburned hydrocarbon content. We don't know what form it's in, but we know how much carbon and hydrogen is in an organic form in the atmosphere we're producing. So all these things start to increase slightly as you approach an equivalence ratio of one stoichiometric conditions. And then once you get to one and above, that curve gets very, very steep. And you get a really big increase in the yields of these products of poor ventilation. So you get big increases in smoke yields, smoke particulate yields. You get big increases in carbon monoxide. If you've got nitrogen in your fuel, you get big increases in the cyanide produced. But what decreases is the products of well-ventilated combustion, which is carbon dioxide. So, you know, one thing we look at is the total fate of all the carbon in the fuel. Where does the carbon go? And we can do an exact accounting of where all the carbon's gone. So when you get to an equivalence ratio of two, which you've got half enough oxygen to burn your fuel, then you find, not surprisingly, that the carbon dioxide yield is more or less halved. But the carbon monoxide yield goes up to something like towards 0.2 ram per gram, varying a bit depending on the material. So the carbon monoxide is going up. I mean, and it's quite interesting to compare what goes on with organic nitrogen and what goes on with organic carbon. And what I found in my experiments with various types of materials was that you can express the yields of these gases as actual yields. So how many grams of carbon monoxide do we get per gram of fuel burned? Think of something simple like polypropylene. So how many grams of carbon monoxide released per gram of polypropylene burned? Or we can think of it in a normalized sense, saying of the carbon content of the starting fuel, polypropylene, how much is released in the form of carbon monoxide? How much in the form of carbon dioxide? So that's the normalized yield. So the normalized yield varies depending on the carbon content of the starting material. So the normalized yield for wood, the actual yield of carbon oxide for wood might be 0.1. The normalized yield might be 0.2 because there's only 50% carbon in wood. Is that confusing everybody? It would be. So the normalized yield is the yield as a function of the elemental composition of the starting material. That's the important point. So as you remember I was saying last time, in something like polyurethane, you might have something like 60% carbon and maybe 10% nitrogen. So you're always going to get a lot more carbon monoxide than you are hydrogen cyanide because you of the normalized yield of carbon in the form of carbon monoxide as a function of equivalence ratio. Well, against the conversion of fuel nitrogen to hydrogen cyanide, they pretty well exactly match on a one to one basis. So if you convert 1% of the carbon to carbon monoxide, you will also have converted 1% of the nitrogen to hydrogen cyanide. And that's very nice because hydrogen cyanide is quite difficult and challenging to measure. Most people have got operators to measure carbon monoxide in their tests, but not many people can cope with things like cyanide. So I'm giving the engineer now a way of getting a pretty good computation of if you've measured the CO and you know the elemental composition of your starting material and you know the nitrogen carbon content of your starting material in your fuel, you can pretty well calculate how much cyanide you might be getting as a function of equivalence ratio. Right? So these things start to come together. I love those little tricks of trade that you're sharing. Like, you may remember in the first interview I've started with Quot of Ammons that toxicity is maybe the most complicated of all things in fire, and maybe even turbulence will be solved before toxicity. And as I talk with you for hours now, I understand more why. I understand more why. It's really a complicated world in which we'll not have an exact solution for everything. Even if we get the yields and stuff exactly, it's doubtful we will get perfect data on LC50 on primates for any toxicant species there is, because it's just unavailable at this point. toxicant species there is because it's just unavailable at this point. But what you propose in here is to use science and research and data to have the second next thing, the second next approximation. So if you cannot measure HCN, well you figured out how to do that based on the material composition, the elemental components of the material and it must be like that because that's the elemental components of the material, and it must be like that, because that's the elemental physics and chemistry. I just wanted to say I absolutely love this way of thinking. Well, I think I said earlier to you I'm learning that we're going to have to live with a certain amount of uncertainty, and we want to love it. Although there's complexity there, I think most of these sort of topic areas, when we first start to look at them, we think they're fairly simple. Like, how much carbon monoxide do you produce in a fly? You might think that's a fairly simple thing to do. And then the more we go into it, as we've been describing, the complexity starts to emerge. And then my mission, I'm hoping to get across to you, is that we can sort of come out the other side a bit and start to find simplicity re-emerging, or that we can, if we can measure and control certain parameters, then we can get a pretty good handle on what's going to be produced in our fire and how we can bring it into our CFD analysis. So I'm trying to persuade you in a way that we can deal with this and produce tools that engineers can use that are good enough to give us a good understanding of what's happening in our fire instance, which is essentially what we really want to do. And ladies and gentlemen, I am really sorry but that's it for today. I had to cut this interview somewhere. We've spent more than two hours talking with David Purser and after this part we go even deeper into chemistry of production of toxic pollutants, the role of nitrogen, halogens, phosphorus, heavy metals, hot smoke zones, and stuff like that. I think it's a whole another hour of interesting, deep dive into toxicity in fires with David. So you feel very invited to the next week's episode. I hope this one already brought you a lot of value for me. In a way, fascinating and perhaps disappointing, devastating. I mean, we focus so much on simple material properties like soot yields and CO2 yields. And yeah, sure, they describe the properties of our materials and to what extent they can produce some products in very specific combustion conditions. But do we even have these conditions on our buildings, really? I feel like we opened a can of worms in here. I mean, I've understood that, that having a different equivalence ratio will lead to different species productions, but it's really such a vast difference if you had under or over-ventilated fire. And just putting a single value on the products, it just simply doesn't make sense. I mean, I got to rethink this. I need to understand how I can incorporate this in my engineering, in my studies. I need to understand if I need to do that. And if I do, if I find it out, I'll share it with you. I mean, David, in the beginning of the episode, talking about Moon Blackfire, has given quite a good idea how this approach can be incorporated, knowing only major species. If you know relevant minor species productions in certain equivalence ratios, you can figure them out. And because in CFD, we conserve the yields and species transport and mass, you can figure out based on the ratios, what's the local concentration of any pollutant if you know the ratios. So there are ways, not easy, perhaps worth it. That's really high level engineering and I am super thankful to David for coming into FireSandShow and sharing this with me and you. So thank you for today. Next Wednesday we know what you can expect. More chemistry just before summer. I guess that's exactly what you need. I feel these interviews with David are perhaps a little harder in terms of the amount of high-level knowledge found in here. In my professional career, I never learned that much about toxicity as I did in these four hours talking to David. So I hope for some of you, at least, it's the same experience. Thank you for being here. See you here next week. Bye.
