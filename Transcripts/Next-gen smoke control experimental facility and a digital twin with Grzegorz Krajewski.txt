 Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to to the Fire Science Show. Today, broadcasting from Brno in Czech Republic. Together with my friend and colleague Grzegorz Kreski, we're at the Femtech Conference. Hi, Grzegorz. Hello. Welcome, everybody. Great to have you in the show. We came here. We're having a local tourney around Europe, sharing the preliminary research of our new fascinating project. And we thought that it may be great to share it with you. What do you think, Cegos? I think it's generally a great idea because the project starts three years, so it's a final moment to show it to the world. I should have said that. It's going like scheduled, right? It's not that we've spent like three years building it. No, actually we did. But we're very happy to have completed stage one or something that we call stage one of the project. It was a big, big advancement in building a new facility for smoke control in corridors. The project name is NZP-131. Grzegorz, we're horrible at naming projects. But it's an official name. We have to find out something new. Well, if someone in the audience has a proposal how to call this sexy project, please let us know because we certainly fail at doing that, unfortunately. Anyway, the project is on the smoke control in corridors. And I think it's a really interesting topic that's very, very worthy of investigation. And it's a really interesting topic that's very, very worthy of investigation. And it's something that consists of two separate parts. Part one would be a new, how we call it, next generation experimental facility for investigation of smoke controls. And this is something that Jagos was leading for the last three years. And part two is something that was more on my shoulders, which is the digital twin of this facility, which is a fancy name for a numerical simulator of the exact same experiments we do in the facility. And when I say it's an next-generation experimental facility for investigation of smoke control, it doesn't really give you an impression of what it is. So, Grzegorz, please tell the listeners what we have actually built in Pionki. Generally, we built a 30-meter long corridor with a height of 3 meters and a variable height of floor, so it's very flexible. The height of the corridor is 1.4 meters, and the corridor is equipped with a fully flexible ventilation system, which allows us to test probably most of possible ventilation combinations. It's kind of interesting when you think about it, it's just a corridor, but a facility like that has, I have never seen a thing like that in my life. We've only seen resurgent corridors that was done ad hoc at some buildings and it was just limited studies that just investigated one parameter or two parameters or just a few parameters. And here we've built a facility that is bespoke engineered to really facilitate multiple variants of fire research in it. And I think it's beautiful because the possibilities are endless for something such a small as just a corridor. Grzegorz, let's talk why we build it. I think it's maybe even more important why than how we build it. For me myself, you know, when you look into statistics, when you look into main causes of death in fires, obviously smoke inhalation always pops up as the number one threat. We observe deadly fires in residential buildings in which the smoke spreads through evacuation pathways, has threatened people outside of the compartment of origin of the fires. And for me, these are very difficult fires, dangerous fires. I mean, if I set a fire in my own living room, I guess I can live with that. But if my neighbor does and I'm in danger, this is a pretty bad situation for myself. So definitely, I feel there is a need to understand how smoke in horizontal evacuation roads travel, what's happening with it, how can we extract it, what can we do with it. For you, what was the rationale when you proposed this research? What was in your mind when you've started pursuing this project? So remember, we were involved in many commissioning tests in residential buildings, in hotel buildings, some kind of public arenas, and there were a lot of corridors. And the problem with corridor is that it's dramatically small space. So when you've got a fire, the smoke is spreading so quickly along the corridor that the time for evacuation and for firefighters is going to be very short. So I think that was the main reason why I decided to take care about that topic. And the second part was the cooperation with the pressure differential system. So I think it was the main reason, yes, and it was connected with my master science. Yeah, that's cool. I think the interaction between systems is something we very, very rarely understand well. We even rarely model that. We even rarely take that into account when we design smoke control systems in our buildings. And certainly, I remember that the time when we were at Krakow Arena, we had this very, very powerful pressurization systems in the corridors, in the staircases that connected to corridors. We were doing hot smoke tests in compartments next to that corridor. We had this very beautiful smoke layer, a good extraction system. Everything was working as it was supposed to. And then, bam, someone opens the door. High-velocity flow gets into the corridor and suddenly you don't have a layer. Everything's mixed around. And I mean, the smoke control was designed as it should. The PDS was designed as it should. It's just they were not designed together. I think that observation is very spot on. The same thing is happening on every construction work. Yes, mine is working properly, but no one is looking at the overall project. Yes. So it works like that. Last time we were in an office building and it was the same situation. So that's the reason why we are talking about the topic, what we are going to test and what we are going to have from these tests. And in the sports arenas, the corridors are huge. They can accommodate all of the smoke, but you mentioned in residential buildings, they're like tiny. Tiny, small, so the time to fulfill with the smoke is very, very short. Exactly. For me, also, when we started doing that, because a significant aspect of this project is to be able to simulate different scenarios. And I don't only mean the scenario of operation of the smoke ventilation system, like what exhaust capacity we have or where the inlets are located, but the whole idea of what happens when the fire starts. in that thesis. It's quite funny because at that point I had a really, really low amount of knowledge on smoke control systems because it was not something I would actively pursue during my studies. I was more interested in detection and suppression. Smoke control was not in the focal point back then, which is funny as I'm now a smoke control engineer. In my master thesis, I thought, okay, I'll need to show some simulations. I wanted to show the modern tools of fire safety engineering, how they play together. And I was doing a simulation of a fire in a compartment next to a 30-meter corridor. Surprise, surprise, the same we just built. What a coincidence. And in that simulation, I just started the fire in the compartment. I opened the door to the corridor. The smoke flows to the corridor and there's nothing I can do with it. It just fills my corridor like completely. I have like one minute of evacuation time. There's literally nothing I can do about it. I increase the smoke system capacity. It doesn't help. I put more inlets. It doesn't really help. I then approach one of the senior colleagues. I show them my CFD and say, I have a problem. It doesn't work. And he's like, yeah, obviously it doesn't work. You didn't shut the door. And I'm like, oh, that's how you do that. I found it really crazy that the scenario of the system, in this case, shutting the door after some time, was the only way I could prove the system is working. And I don't think I proved the system is working. I proved that by shutting the door, I don't have smoke on my corridor anymore. And the more I've worked with these solutions, the more I observed, in a way, this reality of the design. This is exactly what you said yesterday during your presentation. You just have to be a smart, smart engineer, yes, you're closing the door and your system scenario on how you model, how you test, how you validate your solution is very country specific. Like in Poland, we do it in a certain way. In UK, they do it in a completely different way. In Germany, they do it in a different way. In many of these cases, you either have a prescribed heat release rate, smoke, soot yield and other parameters of your fire that you want to model, and based on these parameters, you have some acceptance criteria to which you refer, and then you say your system works. In UK, I believe they had these funny scenarios where they shut the doors and open the doors. Right, and in that point, we are very thankful to Trigon and Carwell Esch, who to us how the UK and British scenario are working with opening and closing the doors on their timeline. But coming back to your sentence which you said, there is a lack of information about what is happening in a full-scale corridor. At the beginning of the project we were thinking of making it some kind of a scale model. But when we started to read the literature, the lack of information was so big. There is one big black hole in that topic. So the last tests were made, I think, 20 years ago or more. So that's why we decided to extend the project and to make the full-scale corridor. decided to extend the project and to make the full-scale corridor. And that's what we have now after the first test. The results are totally different than we expected at the beginning. Yeah, I think it was a good idea to make it full-scale. I mean, it's going to be easier, publishable, right? It makes our work as scientists so much easier when you have full-scale and you don't have justified scaling factors. our work as scientists is so much easier when you have full scaling, you don't have justified scaling factors. But outside of that, I think it is important to establish a new zero. I call it the new North Star, you know, as we have to rely on tricks, on scenarios in estimating smoke control performance. And I'm not saying we design systems that are bad. That's not necessarily the case. I'm just saying we design them in a stupid way where we have no idea what the performance is. We have established some sort of test of validation method that's extremely artificial and that only informs you of how the system ranks against that test, but it does not inform you on what safety does it provide in a building. And if you are all into asset calculations, if you're all into just fulfilling the standard needs, I guess you can live with that. If this standard, if this level of safety, this implicit level of safety hidden within these assumptions, if that's what you aim for, yeah, cool. You can design it like that. But if you truly want to understand how your system works, what do you gain by putting the system, how the system will behave, your fire scenario is slightly different. You have no way to know that today with the current models. And we don't have good experimental proof on how these things work. This is the point what you said, yes. It's time for a big reset to come back to the fundamentals of the small problem. It's just one typical compartment adjustment to the corridor. Very simple. It looks like a very simple topic. But as we can see here, what Wojciech said, yes, we had so many variables which we have to predict. Yes, we have to check how the system is going to work. We have to verify and check the environmental conditions in the corridor, which we still accept. We probably will never have got the perfect conditions, but we have to find the moment when the conditions are acceptable for us and for people who are evacuating during the fire. So, OK, we have the facility now. We hope to do this restart to find a new North Star of smoke control in corridors, give you a benchmark against the solutions can be tested against. And we truly hope to achieve that. It's an ambitious, ambitious goal. Now, let's talk about the facility. I mean, yesterday during my talk, there was already a lot of questions asked about technical details, how the facility works, how does it operate, how does it look like. Unfortunately, in the podcast, you cannot see the pictures, but it does exist. It's beautiful. We love it anyway let's talk a little about technicalities of what we have built so you've said it's a 30 meter long corridor but it doesn't give the whole story as there are things um connected to that like first the compartments as what you said this 30 meter long corridor and there are three compartments adjustment to that corridor. Each one is three by four meters floor area and height three meters. So we have got a huge flexibility of locating the fire source. We can locate it in the middle or at the beginning or at the end of the corridor. So as you can see, we've got just three variables at the beginning. Yes, we can locate the fire inside the corridor in any position where we want. Additionally, this is only the geometrical area. And another point is heat release rate of the fires. So I think we can multiple every possible fire source. We don't have any limitations. So we can make performance tests of fire ventilation from the smallest fires to the biggest fires. I wouldn't be so open about unlimited, because there's a certain point at which the facility will be destroyed. Actually, we have thought about that, and it's built from easily fixable materials, almost disposable materials. So if we damage it, it's very, very easy to fix it. And that's the key for longevity of the facility. But we are using propane burners with varied heat release rate. We do steer that through mass flow inlet of propane into the burner. We can put multiple burners in the facility. So we also influence somehow the heat release rate per unit area. And because of that, we really have almost unlimited possibilities to test any fires. And it's all computer controlled, right, Josh? Yeah, exactly. We can define any fire curve which we want. So the fire heat release rate can change in time exactly as we as we define it so and at that moment we have got four burners so we can even make fire up to two megawatts three megawatts we i think three megawatts is even more than ventilation control for for the compartments but it will but it will destroy the corridor a little price to pay for knowledge anyway this fire source okay that, that's an important aspect. Now, smoke control systems. Because, I mean, you can build... Building a corridor is not that difficult or impressive on its own. I would say that 20% of the struggle with the project was with building the corridor. And the rest was with the smoke control system. So we've equipped it with almost anything you can find on the market like it is entangled by ducts and of different smoke control corridor is is are is are only walls and ceiling and floor but the whole magic of that project was the equipment yes so we looked what kind of systems we have tested before. On that facility, I think we can perform any test which we can imagine on a market, yes? So, for example, transversal ventilation system, semi-transversal ventilation system, long-continual ventilation system. We can, additionally, we can change the way how we supply or exhaust the air from the corridor. It can be natural or mechanical supply or exhaust. So there are unlimited possibilities which we can make on that facility. And that was the point, to have ability to really test whatever solutions are used in the world. And it's obviously all computer controlled, just like the burner. So with the click of a mouse you can turn the longitudinal system into transversal system and change the capacities and stuff like that yeah generally this is the second advantage of the project that is that that we can control everything and everything is registered on in one file so it's synchronized so you can see the temperatures the level on which the ventilators are working, which dampers are open, what was the gas flow on the regulators. So we have got everything in one file synchronized. So it's very easy to repeat every test with the same input parameters. So I hope in your head you're building image of this magnificent facility. so I hope in your head you're building image of this magnificent facility probably the image you build is more beautiful than the facility itself but it is really impressive on what can be done in here and now an important broadcast message to anyone of you listening if you are intrigued with what we have if you like what we have and you have an idea on how to use it to enhance your own research, please just contact us. We are fueled by collaboration. We believe in the collaborative nature of science. I don't like individualism in science. I like collaborations. So if you have a better idea on how to use it than us, please let us know and we'll try to do it. The beauty of the facility is that it took three years to build, but now to set up an experiment, it's like a few hours in one day. Literally in the first day of burning, it was amazing. We have done, how many, three, four tests? During the first day? Yeah. Four tests, yes, but we have been changing many times the ventilation system. So during one test, you are making 20 tests. Yes, so it's just one day of testing. I think it's a fair statement. I think we've generated more useful results for validating CFD than I've seen in the literature of this subject through my entire career. And that was just one day of tests. So the possibilities are endless. And you're all invited to participate. we want this to be a living facility we want this to be yielding useful results for for science for everyone but now we we have the the base yes so we can extend it in every possible way so any ideas just feel welcome to contact with with us so we will try to do that oh yeah we will do And now, as I mentioned, experimental facilities is just one piece of the puzzle. The second piece is the digital twin, which is a fancy way to call CFD simulations for the facility. And here, we've approached the project the same way as the corridor. We want it to be modular. We want it to be parametric. We want it to be able to verify whatever we need. And anyone who's working with CFD models, you probably realize how painful it is to set a CFD model. And it's even more painful to change something. Like you want to move your extraction point by one meter to your left, and then eventually it got into the middle of two meshes of LDS. You have to split it. There's so many annoying things that can happen when you change parameter in your CFD. And now because we are talking about literally hundreds of parameters, literally thousands of possible scenarios to be tested, there's no way you can program that by hand. It would be too much. So we've approached this in a different way. Some of it is similar to how we did our car park research that I've shown in the past. We have taken snippets of FDS code that describe parts of the model. Like I have a snippet of the code that describes the corridor and the compartments. There's a snippet of the code that describes the ventilation systems, the fire devices used in the corridor. Like everything is split into separate snippet files. And then we have parametric scripts that whenever they are fueled with the list of variables to be investigated, they take the snippets that are needed to build this particular case file and they just combine it with the values of the variables that we have defined. So it's a model. I mean, after two years of programming, after it works, I just combine it with the values of the variables that we have defined. So it's a model. I mean, after two years of programming, after it works, I just give it a list. I want to have, like, FDS simulations of fire in room number one, number two, number three, one megawatt, two megawatt, three megawatt. I want the smoke extraction being 1.3 points, 5 points, with the capacity of 2, 5, 10 meters per second inlets here. And then I just press enter and it generates me hundreds or thousands of FDS files that describe every combination of these variables. Then it automatically sends it to our HPC cluster and they calculate. And then, well, a month later we come back, we pick up the results. There are scripts that automatically process that and voila, we're done with it. I think it's super powerful. And especially that we consider these two things as two parts of one exact thing. Like you don't see everything from the experimental measurements, but if you have validated CFD that you trust, you can make an experiment and then use the CFD to understand more of it. Especially what you did and said, before we designed that facility and before we built it and had the idea how it is going to work, we did plenty of CFD calculations. At the beginning, it was about 700 CFD calculations just to predict what is going to happen during the test. And it was our input data to design that facility and to find out what we want from the experimental part of the topic. So it's really both things fuel on each other. Both things are very interconnected and definitely experiments are the number one thing we want to do. We want to find experimental proof for various smoke control performance in corridors. We want to have experimental proof on what really happens in the corridors. That's the number one thing. But thanks to Digital Twin, we can easily enhance that knowledge with much more data points that we would not be able to find otherwise. Yeah, and we knew how to design it, and now we can validate it, having the final data from the experiment. Oh, yeah, that's cool. Let's talk about validation. Good idea. We have performed, as mentioned, so far 13 experiments. A good idea. We have performed, as I mentioned, so far 13 experiments. At that moment, 13 experiments, but with many variables in between in each experiment, yes. Okay, so take us to an experiment. Let's talk about the ones with variable heat release rates. What are we changing? How do we do that? At the beginning, we made a very simple test, just constant fire heat release rates, 100 kilowatts per one hour, just to check what is going to happen with our facility. Yes, because we are not able to predict if it will stay alive after one test. So it did until now. Yes. So first we started from the steady state fires lasting one hour, half an hour until we have got steady state conditions. lasting one hour, half an hour, until we have got steady state conditions. And later we started to change heat risk rate during the test after every five minutes. We were increasing the heat risk rate, starting from 50 kilowatts up to 500 kilowatts, and then decreased down, just looking what is happening with the temperatures along the corridor. On the plus, it looks like a pyramid with steps. It grows, then stays stable for like five minutes, and grows again and again and again. Like a PID controller. Yeah, but it's really great, because it generates you plenty of data to validate CFD. And obviously, for these experiments, we have performed CFD with FDS, taking just the basic settings of the model, like really not playing with anything, not touching any more advanced settings of the solver. For the more complicated cases, especially the star's growth of fires, we have found some discrepancies. The temperatures in the experiments are approximately 50 degrees higher than the CFD, which, I mean, it's okay-ish for a first shot, but we're not very happy with it. We hope to improve it, but there's like, we already have good ideas on where to look for solutions to that. So overall, over the because of these 13 simulations, we already have something like a validated CFD model. Yeah, but we have a lot of doubts, yes, especially when you are making a full-scale experiment. There are many, many questions if your heat release rate of fire is exactly that what you predicted at the beginning, yes? That's why we are going to make another test in the room corner, verify our heat release rate of the burner for the higher values. Yeah, we used propane burners with mass flow controllers that allow us to set any value of propane flow into the burner. And with previous experience in open air measurements of these burners, we were quite happy with how they work. But now as they're in a confined space of the corridor there are some doubts how this can influence the heat release rate actually okay and and now let's move into the the future how do we see the use of this facility like we finished the stage one building starting app we're in the final phases of validation of the cfds the facility is up and running. The experiments are fairly easy to set up. Of course, they're not without the problems, but everything's manageable. Everything's working as we've expected it to work. Now, where are we going with it, Djibos? At that moment, I think we are planning to extend the amount of thermocouples to have a more dense grid of points when we measure the temperature. We are going to add additional thermocouple trees. We are going to add thermocouples at the floor and in the ceiling. And at the end of September, we'll have the possibility to measure the intensity of radiation. I'm also looking into putting oxygen measurements into the corridor to have a better comparison with the CFD and we've not mentioned that but we also are measuring the velocities in the smoke layer in the ceiling jet which also will be used to compare the data we have with the CFD but not only with also zone models, with Alpert's correlations, with corridor ceiling jet models, opens quite a lot of possibilities there. And after we finish our plan of making the combination of fire ventilation, when we have got source of heat and smoke in the middle of corridor, we will just relocate the burner to the room and we will start the real tests of fire ventilation system when we have got the fire in compartment. Including shutting the doors at different points of experiment, opening them, opening the windows in the compartments, changing the size of the doors. Many, many variables play, right? Exactly like that. And probably in the end of this year, we have sprinkler system. Probably in the end of this year, we'll have sprinkler systems, so we'll try to make some preliminary tests of how a smoke layer and how the temperature field is changing when the sprinkler system is running. We also have water mist, right? Water mist and sprinkler system. Fantastic. Both of them. Fantastic. I'm looking forward to that. And how this is the facility in what, one, two, three years? Hopefully we won't burn it down. That's like number one thing. But hopefully we can use it for something good. What's the craziest piece of research you would like to do on it? I think we'll try to make as big fire as possible, yes, especially that we are making the commissioning tests and we exactly don't know what is the limit of fire ventilation system to make the proof that it works properly but if we combine everything together sprinkler system fire ventilation system detection system we will try to make the fire scenarios as flexible as possible yes because we are going to make some detection system which will decide which dump which dumpers should be open which dump decide which dumpers should be open, which dumpers should be closed. So we are going to do some kind of an intelligent system. I'm also looking forward to some more in the middle of next year when we will install the pressurization systems next to the corridor so we can check the influence on how a quick stream of air changes the buoyancy of the smoke layer in the corridor. How do these systems work together? I think there is so much to uncover there that can influence both the ways how we design the smoke control, but also the pressurization. And the next problem which we are going to check is that because Wojciech and me are involved in wind engineering, so there are windows in rooms, there are glass parts of the facades which can just break down. So we are going to check what will happen if you have got some influence of the wind, which is outside of the corridor, and how it influences on the fire ventilation systems. So, but it's the topic for next year, I think so. I think you've already seen some of that accidentally in Experiment 6, where you had strong wind acting on your natural openings in the corridor, and the whole smoke layer was fluctuating, and we have these crazy measurements. Yeah, we have got a big bumping of temperature. So this test is not easy to validate, but it happens, yes? I like it. I actually like it it because when you plot the temperature over the FDS simulation, you see the averages match it, that just in the real-world case, the temperatures were going up, down 50 degrees when the wind was blowing on the facility. In FDS, it's just perfect uniform conditions. It doesn't mean it's useless. I think it's interesting, and what you said, taking wind into account when designing corridors. Wind-driven fires have been known for ages, for decades, that they are challenged, devastating, they're deadly. So absolutely, that's something to look for. And, you know, understanding to what extent wind actually influences the performance of mechanical smoke ventilation, that's something I don't think we have a good answer yet. We don't have an answer, but as you remember, we were making a lot of commissioning tests in a high-rise building where there was a facade with open windows. And if there was the wind outside of the building, the fire ventilation system didn't work exactly as it was designed and as it was predicted by the designer. So that's what we would like to test next year. I think, you know, the coolest thing is that we have this body of experience. We have these anecdotal examples or anecdotal proofs of different claims. You've seen that happen once in a high-rise building during commissioning. We don't really have a worked-out scientific proof of how it works. We don't have an understanding why it was like that, and that we have a full-scale experimental facility that's armed up with measurement systems, that's armed up with all the automation that we need. Finally, we can build evidence-based fire science. And I think that makes me the most excited about this project. And we can verify what will happen depending on the direction of the wind, yes, the wind speeds. So that's what we have found out during the commissioning tests. Then now we try to make it a little bit theoretical and research, and I think it will give us an answer how we should design that kind of system to make it fully safety for people. Okay, we need to cut this out. We're going down into rabbit hole. I guess we can talk about these possibilities for ages. It's so exciting. You can imagine our state of mind. We've been building this for three years in secrecy how we've been we've been designing this we've been pouring our hearts and tears into into into building this there was a lot of pain including physical pain there was a lot of work including heavy physical work but it looks like it was all worth it and now to set up an experiment a few hours and experiment is set and one day later you have results that no one ever has seen in the fire science this is the magic of full-scale experimental facilities as we said we are on a tourney around europe jaggers are going to vilnius for the bal Fire. But starting from Monday, we are going to make another test. So, of course, of course. But as we are sharing this with the world, I'll try to drop some links in the show notes to the current presentations about the topic. I think the Femtech materials will be published on YouTube at some point. And they're definitely available to anyone registered to the conference. So thanks, Thunderhead, for openly sharing that at some point. I'll drop the links. I'll make sure it's updated. You can learn more about the facility. And just follow us on Twitter. Follow us on ResearchGate. You will be sure to find the newest materials related to this project. So thank you very much, and I hope it will be very useful for all of us all over the world. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Thanks for listening. And now we're going back to enjoy the conference in beautiful Brno in Czech. It's fantastic. I'm happy to see so many familiar faces in here, meet new people. So yeah, that's it for today's Fire Science Show and see you back next Wednesday where we'll summarize the conference because there's many CFD modeling and evacuation modeling updates that are absolutely worth to share with all of you. Thank you, guys. Bye. And thanks, Grzegorz. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
