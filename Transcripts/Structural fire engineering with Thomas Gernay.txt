 Hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show episode 57. I hope you guys are having a great summer time and some fire science in between will not hurt for sure. Today I have a subject that's quite difficult and me as well. I don't have great expertise in this so I was very happy to learn firsthand from the world leading expert and the topic is structural fire engineering and structural fire modeling in fact. I've invited Professor Thomas Jeunet from Johns Hopkins University to bring me in line on how structural fire engineering works, what's the newest developments in this field, and what's the future in front of that. He has considerable amount of knowledge poured into the world of structural fire engineering literature. And he's involved with one of the primary structural fire engineering codes, that is SAFIR. So he has firsthand knowledge, not only from the perspective of a researcher, structural engineer, but also as someone who's developing new tools for us all to use. So that's a really great perspective. And you'll see through the interview that we're touching and referring to that all the time because his perspective is unique. So I hope that despite the little summer slack most of us have, you can join me in this episode and learn a bit about the importance of structural fire engineering and the role that it plays in a performance-based design framework. Hey, I guess that's enough of introduction. It's a good episode. You want to listen to the end. It's well worth it. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the FireSciShow. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. You guys ask and I deliver. Here with me, Dr. Thomas Gernay from Johns Hopkins University. Hey, Thomas. Hey, Wojcik. How are you? I'm very good. I'm very happy to have you on the show and finally talk with someone about numerical modeling of structures. For a nice start, I've heard there was a really nice event lately in Italy, a summer school on structural modeling. And I keep hearing about this event from everywhere. Like everyone is telling me how great it was. And I know the viewpoint of participants, you were one of the speakers there. So maybe you can bring me in line what happened in Italy? Or unless what happens in Italy stays in Italy, I don't know. No, I'm happy to tell you all about it. First of all, thank you so much for having me. It's a great pleasure, and I'm a fan of your show. So, yes, we had this week-long summer school in Como, one of the best places in the world, really nice location in May. That was organized by dear colleagues at the Politecnico di Milano, Roberto Felicetti and Patrick Bamonte. And Jean-Marc Francen was also involved. So the goal was to bring together 10 speakers for each of them delivering a half day lecture on the topic of their expertise and have PhD students and researchers from all over get the opportunity to either come in person or attend remotely. And it was very interactive and productive. It was very nice to be in a room together and being able not only to teach about a topic close to what I've been interested in recently, but also get the feedback and discussion and get to know what all these researchers are working on. And I mean, definitely lots of very exciting topics, looking at new problems. So just all this structural fire engineering community coming together was great. Yeah, I got to talk about the burnout resistance of structures, which is a topic I've been researching for quite a long time, actually. That started with my PhD work, where I worked on the development of numerical models for the behavior of concrete at elevated temperature. And I paid particular attention to what happens during the cooling down phases. We wanted to make sure that we were capturing irreversible processes and damage and transient creep and all this stuff. And so with these models, then we became able to model more accurately what happened during cooling and whether there was a risk of delayed failure. And since then, it has evolved into modeling all types of structures during heating and cooling and developing a framework to understand when there is a risk of delayed collapse. So that was about Italy. That's a great topic, and I have a feeling we're going to touch on it a lot in this episode. And I've asked about the summer school because there's a lot of young fire engineers listening, a lot of researchers, students, graduates, postgraduates, PhD students, postdocs. If you ever wonder if it is worth to go summer school, it is worth it totally. From my experiences with summer schools, it is absolutely amazing way to get the knowledge. Probably the best way, even better than my podcast, I would say. But yeah, never mind that. Okay, so let's go back to your PhD thesis. You said you were developing numerical models, and I also know you are involved in development of SAFR, one of the more popular codes in structural fire engineering. So as we venture into the world of numerical modeling and structural fire engineering, maybe you can tell me the story why there was a need for new codes to be built or you just wanted a new yacht and the whole mad Italy coast from that. That's a good motivation too. Well, certainly I'm happy to tell this story because I think it's a nice one and a timely one. So my PGT is is, we are talking about like 2009, 2012, that range. And the tensile membrane action was a big topic since I would say one decade earlier, right? It had originated with the observations at Cardington in the 1990s with the BRE and all the research in the UK and Professor Wang, Professor Bailey, you know, doing those seminal findings at the beginning of the 2000s. And so it became clear that there was really a need to be able to model entire structural systems and the behavior and not only the structural frame, but that the behavior of concrete and the concrete slabs became also something that matters and that influenced the response. So with the tensile membrane actions, you mean the way how slabs will respond to the load, how they would carry the forces in the building, and how important part they take in like the general structural stability of the building. So not just the frame, but also everything that connects the frame. Exactly, yes, good point. So let me backtrack exactly. So at the Cardington test, what was done is that in the 1990s, the BRI, they tested entire buildings subjected to natural fire, right, to a fire. And so that was the first or one of the first time, you know, that they really investigated the behavior of the structural system as opposed to testing isolated members in furnaces. And what was observed is that the behavior as a whole was much more favorable and you had this redundancy and those alternate load paths that you could activate. So you end up with structurally behavior that's more robust than you would predict based on single members behavior. For example, you could leave some of the steel beams with no thermal insulation, right? They would exhibit large deflections. But when you get those large deflections in the floors that go with them, that deflect with them, you start activating tension in the reinforcement that's embedded in the concrete. And so this steel reinforcement remains cold. It's protected by the concrete of the slab. But if it is designed properly, now you can carry the loads with this alternate load path in this deformed shape, which becomes really interesting because it means you have a robust behavior that's really embedded in the structure that doesn't require insulation from the thermal action. embedded in the structure that doesn't require insulation from the thermal action. So with this realization, they started to be, you know, development of numerical models to try to reproduce this behavior and understand it, and then work towards design methods, analytical methods. But so SAFIRE was already around, and I want to come back a little bit later on how it had been developed originally, right? But when I started my PhD, I would say the behavior of concrete had not been so important before 2009 issue. But there started to be all this research on tensile membrane action and large-scale European research projects. And we really wanted to have something robust and accurate to capture what was happening in those concrete floors when they were undergoing tensile membrane action, large displacements, heating and cooling, and so on. So that was really the motivation to fill this gap in the computational modeling tools at that time to have accurate models for concrete in multi-axial stress states subjected to heating and cooling and so on. So before that, it means SAFIR was already around and other software as well, of course, to start modeling, you know, structural fire behavior. And I think that started in the late 1980s and mostly in the 1990s. The idea was that, of course, to achieve fire safety of the built environment, you have those different layers of safety that you want to rely on, right? So you want prevention, you want active fire protection and so on. But as a last resort, you really have the structural fire response. And for quite some time, structural engineers did not really focus much on the structural fire response. And fire protection engineers probably had the oversimplified way of thinking about structural fire response. And my PhD advisor, Jean-Marc Franzen, told me the story of the first time he visited to the U.S., I think, and he was a young engineer, expert in structural fire behavior, but starting, and he got to speak with somebody working on the fire dynamics, fire protection engineer. And basically they were asking, OK, can you tell me the critical temperature of your structure? Right. Because I can do the heat transfer. I can find the temperature. So if you tell me the temperature at which your structure fails, you know, we are all set. We don't need to look more into the structural fire response. So it was this idea that it's a purely thermal problem, basically, which it is not, of course. But it still is treated like that in many cases, with drawing isotherms inside beams or even the concept of charring depth and loss of area of timber parts. So it still is, in a way, considered like a thermal problem. And if you think about it, like like let me tap to what you said, in Cardington they did for the first time the full building, but Cardington was like in 1990s, and we were doing structural fire engineering for 100 years back then. Already, we've been doing it with furnaces. And in a furnace, in essence, unless you have a loaded element, that's a little different when you have a loaded element. And it depends on how you connect the element to the furnace in terms of what the free end is and how it can react. But in a great simplification, the fire test is a thermal test, like essentially test the thermal behavior of your system and all the criteria you have are in a way related to the thermal response, especially the insulation and the capability to keep the smoke sealed inside the compartment, not spread through openings, cracks. So we are still very in the element and thermal response paradigm. So you want to say that numerical modeling was a way to break this paradigm or escape it in a way? Absolutely. Yes, you're right. We're still relying on this simplification in most of the case and very largely in the field. And as you say, numerical modeling is actually a way to overcome this simplification and start investigating the actual anticipated structural response under these thermal demands. And that is important because we observed that in many cases, the thermal approach itself or the element approach in looking at these isotopes does not answer important questions or does not really predict what the in-situ behavior is going to be. So the tensile membrane action was kind of the first or very remarkable example of that, where you can actually leave the temperature go much higher in part of your structural frame and still have a very robust behavior. And so that opens the door to not only optimization and economic savings in terms of thermal insulation, but also understanding really the safety level of your building, as well as having a behavior that's very robust because this load-bearing capacity is really embedded in the structure. There are many other examples where numerical modeling will give you information that is inaccessible with element testing and based only on the thermal response. So I mentioned briefly that I was talking about burnout resistance during the summer school in Como. And actually, we can rebound on this. So if you start looking at the structural response throughout the different phases of the fire, and you're interested in maintaining stability to full burn out, because structural collapse would not be acceptable because you are concerned about fire service intervention, resilience and so on, then you start having to model what happens during the different phases, including during the cooling. And the notion of critical temperature really does not make much sense anymore because you will have a delayed temperature increase in different parts of the section. For example, if we think about a timber section, you might have the charring that stops, but you still have the heat wave that goes toward the core of the section, which will lead to additional reduction of the load-bearing capacity, maybe at temperatures lower than the charring temperature, but still higher than what the material can really support without being damaged or reduced. So in that sense, you really need this capability to model structures in fire, because either you want to quantify safety, you want to optimize design, you want to quantify safety you want to optimize design you want to look at stability to full burnout or many other other situations really another thing that immediately comes to my mind is troubling fires and the concept of like four hour fire resistance like there there is like no way fire can be in the same place for four hours. It's like that would be insane amount of fuel load in one place. Actually, you can have fun and try to do the calculations. But we were once calculating how much fuel load you would need to create standard condition on a ceiling of an airport. ceiling of an airport and we came to conclusion it would have to be like literally stacks of trucks filled with like ikea furniture on top of each other reaching almost the ceiling to have this four hour fire at this super tall position but now now back to traveling fires i had an episode with gil moraine about traveling fires and everyone's highly recommended to go back to that one i'll link in the in the show notes to learn about the method itself. The thing is that there is tons of possible outcomes of the fires. There are fires that will travel very quickly, which means they will be very high intensity fires, but they will burn to the fuel very quickly. There will be fires that are slow, which burn slowly to the fuel, but they also spread slower, and they can go from left to right, from right to left, from middle out, from out to middle. There's hundreds of, or actually there's a limitless amount of ways how a fire can go through the building, even if you're not modeling, if you're just assuming some sort of fire behavior, as traveling fire is such a simplified model. And now you end up with hundreds or thousands, tens of thousands of scenarios to investigate, and there is absolute, like your fire resistance is just one data point. That is it. That's your data point to one time-temperature relation in a certain amount of time within these boundary conditions of this particular furnace in this particular laboratory. That is pretty much the answer you have. And you have 10,000 scenarios to go through and compare. So no way you can relate that. We try, but it's hard. While in numerical modeling, you can probably just test them all or just figure out which are the worst. You also have experiences in this application. Was it also something you have considered back then when you joined the SAFR team? I guess traveling fires was not the thing because I think it was just about to begin in this time. But short, hot or long cold Eurocode fires, localized fires were there for sure. Absolutely. It's a great point to bring because I was telling the story of the fire protection engineer who asked us for one critical temperature as if it would summarize the response of the structure. But we structural engineers also may tend to oversimplify and ask the fire dynamission to provide us with a standard fire curve and think that it will capture all the possible fire behaviors and we can work only with that. And of course, that's not the case. And as Guillermo has shown with some papers where he showed that the traveling fires can challenge the structure to an extent that is different, in some cases more onerous than, I would say, compartment fire conditions. And also the opposite way, there are many situations where once you model the fire behavior based on what we call a physically based fire, formerly called natural fires, you find that the conditions may be less on the rest than with the standard fire or full post-flashover fire. And that also opens opportunities for design optimization or even enabling architectural designs when you know if an architect wants some exposed steel or exposed timber and it really makes sense to look at what are the realistic fire scenarios that could develop in this type of structure and then investigate the response of the structure under those fires rather than look at what we are using in standard furnace test. Exactly. So absolutely to your point, this development of structural fire engineering also worked alongside developments of fire models for structural engineers and a lot of the, in the end, impact that it has had on practice and where really we could see a value of adopting this analysis was linked not only to a better understanding of the structural fire response, but also more realistic representation of what fire scenarios might be. So I think that's key. I think more generally, to your point also, I wanted to compare with what we do in standardized furnace testing versus what numerical models enable us to do. So in civil engineering and buildings, we are not dealing with mass production products, right? We are not building iPhones or cars where we have the luxury to build a few specimens that we will test full scale because we are just building millions of them. But on the opposite, buildings are all unique. So it will never be an option to build an entire building aside the actual building we want to use and set it on fire. So what we are doing in a sense is that we are just taking a few components and applying a standardized furnace test and extrapolating that it will inform us on the behavior of the full building. As if, I would say, in a car crashworthiness test, we are just testing the bumper and maybe a few components and then trying to understand how the car would react in the actual crash test. And besides, all buildings are different. So you would test the bumper and you would extrapolate that maybe it informs you on the Opel Astra and on the BMW Series 5 the same way, right? So we are never going to do that experimental testing for the buildings. So really, computational models make a lot of sense because there you can build these digital trends and challenge them against lots of types of conditions and all those fire scenarios that you mentioned. I would put one more thing on standard testing. Many people don't like this way of talking about standard testing, but it is in a way a reality. You have to consider standardized testing in relation to product. It is a standardized product testing. It was never meant to be a test of a building. Because it fits so tightly within the framework of product being certified before it is delivered to the market, so the market understands the core characteristics of the product. And that's exactly the need that fire testing in laboratory caters for. And therefore, because we have this as a standard product testing, the manufacturers use this as a ranking tool or, you know, it's a way to compete. My product has this classification, yours has other ones, so mine is better. It gives you a fairly easy way to overlook the market. There's like only one product that has this specific parameter and every other is worse. So I lose this one. And it also is a very attractive way for non-specialist stakeholders to put a product because they have no idea. But the code says this product of this characteristic is just enough for your building. but the code says this product of this characteristic is just enough for your building. So this is a whole framework fit around delivering products to market that cater to specific needs and can be distinguished by the characteristics. Whereas a building does not have a single response fire resistance characteristic. Like you said, it can burn and collapse in probably thousands of ways and each of them will be different, very specific and the job of structural engineer like you is to make sure that in probable scenarios it does not collapse or that maybe even more that there is no disproportionate collapse. Like very small fire doesn't collapse it because if a meteor strikes your building, then it's not going to probably survive. Here is this fork between the product market and the building market. It's just in eyes of many people, it's the same market, or it not necessarily is. It's just in the eyes of many people, it's the same market, where it not necessarily is. However, I still find, but you still don't do structural engineering like that for every single building, right? There are like keg-resite buildings that you just take from the book. Absolutely. And so, yeah, also let me make a few things clear. First of all, I mean, standardized test testing is tremendously important and it has elevated the baseline of safety, right? It's been a great answer to a true problem at the beginning of the 20th century. It has brought amazing benefits. And even for us, you know, working on computational modeling, experimental testing is an absolutely crucial component to validate our models. Whenever new material are developed, we need the data. We cannot just extrapolate material models. We have to have those data points. So all this, absolutely. And sometimes as we speak, I would say push on the limitations to make clear why we do what we do and what's the value added. But it doesn't mean that there are lots of rationale also for continuing doing those standardized tests. But, I mean, I agree with what you said. It's really in going further than certifying these products and understanding or rating the behavior of these beams and columns and doors and so on. But how do we scale that up and how do we re-interrogate the true safety level of the assembly of the system once we build the building out of these components? That is something that we don't have the luxury to look at through full-scale experimental testing because in civil engineering, we are building unique objects, right? So I argue that computational modeling is really the tool to bridge this gap and to go to that higher level. And as you said, there are many ways that a fire can challenge a structure, and we need to make sure that what we are building is robust when it's in, I mean, the true conditions and subjected to physically based fire. And when we are looking at performance objectives that might go beyond a standardized rating, a one or two standard fire resistance, but we might need to demonstrate survival to full burnout or the fact that the damage remains localized and we don't have this kind of progressive collapse as you were referring to and so on. collapses you were referring to and so on. And in the interface between fire testing and full-scale behavior, you use fire testing as validation and as a way to obtain data on materials, on structural behavior. But in the end, when you go into numerical modeling of a building, if we can jump into that part, are you still using the standard curve as your boundary condition, or would you go with your localized fire? How do you, like, you have your properties of your materials and stuff. How do you define fire in structural fire engineering then? So when we apply computational modeling for predicting the behavior of a structure in fire, and as you said before, it's not for every small building or every case, but when we do so, usually we frame it in the context of performance-based fire design, right? So it means that we start by setting up objectives, performance objectives for design. So explicitly, we have to define what we are trying to achieve or what we want, what conditions we want the structure to survive and what failure means and what a successful design is, because that will be different for all structures. As I said before, for some, we may want to demonstrate survival to full burnout of the fires and for others, a certain duration of stability or yet other objectives. So then at the second step, we will work on design fires. And in this context of performance-based fire design, usually we don't rely on the standard fire curve, which really has another purpose. So once we are going with modeling, we are interested in trying to predict realistic or physically based fires that would develop given the conditions and what we know of the inputs for the building. And so we might have to check both post-flashover fires and localized slash traveling fires, depending on the geometry of the compartment, ventilation conditions, the fuel, and so on. It is not enough to consider one design fire because there are so many uncertainties involved. A robust performance-based design will rely on a series of design fires and look at the effects of variation of these inputs. the effects of variation of these inputs. Usually, it's good practice to, in any case, check a localized fire that might be very close to a colon, for example, which will always occur at the beginning, right at the early stage of the fire. And then the full growth and development of that fire possibly transitioning to flashover. We know, of course, for example, ventilation assumptions will have a big impact also. So there is some guidance to look at when windows will break and so you can have your ventilation condition suddenly change when the gas temperature reaches a certain value, this type of thing. So first, performance objectives. Second, design fires. And then we go with the thermal structural response of the structure. Wait, wait, wait. Yes. You have the assumptions, but you don't have the fire modeling yet. So you would go with like some simple hand calculations, a zone model. I don't think CFD, because I think that would be very rare. So how you go from assumptions to thermal? You're right. I didn't mention it. But, no, we have access to the full suite of tools there. So we can do analytical methods, kind of Eurocode parametric fire that we have commonly used, for example, in probabilistic risk assessment analysis. We want a lot of scenarios and really look at this variability of conditions. You can also go traveling fire, like we've mentioned before, where you would have a plethora of scenarios which are pre-generated for your geometry with a very simple model of different complexity, depending on which you use. Absolutely. So analytical model for post-flashover or traveling fire or localized fire. So in the Eurocode, we are usually relying on models in the Eurocode. You have Hazemi, you have Eskestat, you have now Locafi, which will be included in the next version of Eurocode, which is a solid flame model to capture the heat radiation to a member that is outside of the fire. We have sort of traveling fire models that you mentioned also with some very elegant and relatively simple solutions. also with some very elegant and relatively simple solutions. But we also use FDS. And actually, one of the not so recent anymore, but relatively recent development in SAFIR was to facilitate the transfer between output data from FDS and the thermal structural analysis. So usually there are two techniques that we would use to couple CFD simulation, and I'm talking about FDS interchangeably because that's really the most common, with FEM analysis. We can use the concept of adiabatic surface temperature developed by Wickstrom, and we've done that, so we have all those sensors around our structure. We need to make sure we have enough of them to capture thermal gradients, to capture shadow effects and so on. But when we are looking at modeling a larger structure, for example, we've used in open car parks simulations and these type of things, where we have lots of structural members and we would need a lot of sensors. We have also the option to use automatic interface file. So it was developed with the developers of FDS. Actually, we can ask FDS to write a transfer file as an output of the simulation that will output the gas temperature and radiant intensities along lots of directions in space at, I mean, spatial coordinates in a domain that we define. And SAFIRE can read this transfer file and use that as input thermal boundary conditions for the heat transfer analysis in the sections. And that is the advantage that it's automatized. So it's well suited when you have a big structure and it captures the shadow effect. It sees the view angles and everything to capture radiation appropriately. This is brilliant. I didn't know about that. I actually, I'm like in ANSYS ecosystem. So I know a bit on FDS because of my hobby. I have to follow that. But I'm not like everyday user of FDS outside of scientific research. And it sounds like a really, really nice development. user of the ESL side of scientific research. And it sounds like a really nice development. Some time ago, I was thinking like what has changed in like last 10 years when I work in this field and not that much has changed. But this is something like really a huge quality of life improvement that really allows you for seeming less connection between your fluid and structure model. That's very interesting. And have you tried anything in the, I know in Ansys ecosystem, I have not mastered this functionality yet. One of my colleagues in the office is playing, but we have like two-way coupled interactions. So if like the structure, let's say you have a steel sheet roof, and if the roof fails, you have a hole and that hole is then transferred from my structural model to fluid model. So the fluid model incorporates the way how this hole would change the flow fields. But I guess that's quite complicated, probably difficult, especially if you have within the one ecosystem. It is complicated. That's something we have not addressed yet. But it is relevant for certain applications. You mentioned an example. There are, of course, other examples where this two-way feedback or two-way coupling makes sense. I would say fundamentally, when I'm describing these developments, it really comes from a realization on our behalf and people working in structural fire engineering that a lot of the advances and the gaps were at the intersection of the disciplines. This is often the case in engineering and science. So I told you earlier the story of the fire protection engineers who asked for the critical temperature and the structural engineer who asked for the standard fire resistance or fire curve. So we saw that value was in connecting those two worlds and making it easier in terms of the numerical modeling ecosystem to bridge and couple the advanced fire models with the advanced structural simulations. So we are putting a lot of effort on these. And right now we have all these options for the one-way coupling from the fire to the structure. What you described is a very interesting future development that can possibly, you know, is making even more important and I would say timely now with the use of combustible building materials and this tension between sustainability and fire safety that we are observing. And Professor Luke Bisbee had a great kind of position paper on this, the fact that we are innovating fast to address the climate emergency. And we are doing those changes in the way we build structure and we use material. And we have the example with facades, the example with mass timber and so on. And there are implications for fire safety. And we need to make sure while we address this very important momentous challenge of climate crisis, that also it's not at the expense of public safety. And I think computational modeling is a tremendous role to play there because innovation goes so fast. We need to predict what the implications are going to be and what challenges it poses for fire behavior, including structural fire behavior. But in some cases, there might be a question of two-way coupling that you are describing. It's obvious that exposed timber is going to fuel the fire and affect the fire dynamic as well as having the load-bearing function that it has and so on. And there are other examples where you might have the structural response affect the fire dynamics and thermal environment. It's also important in other questions, for example, I would say compartmentation issues and even failure of non-load-bearing walls and compartment boundaries. This is also something that right now we cannot really predict with those computational models. But as we were talking about traveling fire, it might be interesting to have the capability to predict if due to large deflections of the load-bearing structure, it might damage some non-road bearing walls and then the fire can travel to the next compartment. So there are still lots of very interesting and challenging questions to explore. For me, one of the most interesting is the behavior of glazing because it's something that we are very highly reliant on in our modeling and not always we're very explicit about it because we just assume an opening factor which is usually related to the glazed area, assuming that it's going to fall off, which not necessarily is the case and modern glazing is showing more chances. Do you have any solutions for that in Sapphire, like special models or something? We don't explicitly model usually the glazing. We don't model non-load bearing members. So traditionally it's a very practical answer. Sorry, so that goes back to the your assumptions and the thermal model that is run before the thermal structural model. That's right. So a practical answer is that there is a guidance in the Luxembourgis annex to the Eurocode, which is a very just pragmatic way of approaching this question of glazing and changing ventilation. So in the Luxembourg annex, they give a temperature of the gas at which a certain ratio of the windows get broken, depending on the type, if it's simple, double, triple glazing or reinforced glazing. And they also prescribe doing a few scenarios. So, for example, they would say run a scenario where 90% of your windows are open from the start, but then another scenario where they are closed. But I don't know, I remember 30 percent that opens when the gas go to 200 degrees c and then 90 percent when it goes to 300 degrees c it just gives you a framework such that you first of all you check different scenarios because we know the fire conditions the demand will be very different depending on those inputs so again one design fire is not enough and also you well you have some guidance everybody Everybody does the same. And it is linked, it is correlated to failure temperature of glazing based on thermal gradients on the surface. But it's not a detailed modeling of glazing. Fantastic. Thank you for this robust answer. I was also not aware of the Luxembourg Annex. I need to check that out because it is something that I'm recently very interested at. I'm also about to organize a nice guest on the glazing in the podcast. So that's also an episode to look for. Now I wanted to ask you, like, where is it going, right? Is there any particular direction that structural FSC modeling is going or SAFIR is heading? Like, how do you guys see the future? Will it be like more simulations, more answers, more probabilistic approach, or maybe rather going into route of optimization and trying to find the cheapest non-collapsible structure you can build given your boundaries. I wonder what's the hot topic now in the world of structural fire engineers? That's a great question, of course. And we are working really on a range of problems and always trying to move that forward. I think high level, I'm really convinced that numerical modeling is a key enabler of everything we do in civil engineering, structural engineering. We want to provide two things. We want to provide the tools, really the ecosystem that people can go and it's robust, it's validated, it's state of the art, and you can run those software to predict the response. And we also work on the framework, which is to understand how computational modeling can support, and it's linked to performance-based design, to probabilistic risk assessment, and these type of very important approaches that are used in not only fire safety engineering, but in general in structural design. So in the future, what we are really focusing on now, I would say maybe three things that I want to highlight. The first one is that there are always new materials and innovations that come on the market that are considered and understanding the fire safety implications of these are really critical. And because if we don't, it can hinder the implementation of these in the market. So, I mean, we have amazing people doing developments to bring these new materials to maybe be more environmentally friendly, but we need to be able to apply them. So we need to understand what the implication is for fire safety. And so that implies being able to model the thermal mechanical properties, the behavior of those materials. In some cases, when it's combustible material, it has other challenges as well. And then how do we model these in structural system in building simulations, right? So that's really the first point. The second one is I was just hitting at working on the frameworks. So I'm very interested in performance-based structural fire design, on the frameworks. So I'm very interested in performance-based structural fire design, which means how do we go about this process of defining performance objectives? So already lots of questions. What is appropriate performance level? What kind of targets, reliability should we strive for? What are the implications of looking at resilience of the built environment against fire, multi-hazards? So lots of questions there already. Then once we have the performance objective, we have to define the design fires, and we've talked about that. There are also lots of scenarios, and how do we know which one to select, and then how do we make it easy to develop these and interface them with the structural simulation. I love how the challenge is at the philosophical level, structural simulation. I love how the challenge is like at the philosophical level, not necessarily related to like transferring loads or modeling nonlinear thermal behavior of materials. No, we really have to sort out the scenarios and objectives. This is the number that's like the need. I really love how you positioned it because it echoes so well with so much that has been said in the podcast. I absolutely love it. But sorry for interrupting you. Continue this. No, no, thanks, Apri. But I think it's key, absolutely. It's both the tools and the framework. How do we use the tool? We want to think very hard about that as well because providing the tools is not enough. We want it to be robust. We want it to make sense in terms of the risk assessment and the performance and so on. So working on the design fire, still in my performance-based fire design, right? And then on the thermal structural modeling, there is a lot we can do. We've worked a lot this last decade and before, but there are still things we cannot do. Modeling a CLT floor, we don't really have the element to do that right now. But it's used. People build buildings with that. So if you want to model a structural system, that will be something more practical. We need a PhD to look at, a PhD student, I mean, to look for three, four years at how do we develop the type of shell elements and the material models and so on for this orthotropic behavior. So there are also these kind of questions, of course, that we are working on. So first was, you know, new materials enabling that. Second, the framework, the performance-based design, also probabilistic. I have not talked that much about it, but I've worked a lot with some incredibly smart colleagues, such as Ruben Van Kual and Danny Hopkins, whom you had here. Negar Alamikorazani, a good friend and amazing researcher from University at Buffalo, Shunani and others. And together we really teamed up because it's a very big challenge to move structural fire engineering into the probabilistic risk assessment framework and make it very consistent in terms of how we think about risk, what type of reliability we design for and so on. And because it requires exploring a range of scenarios, also computational modeling is the natural tool to go around it. And so the third thing I would say when you ask me about what's the future, it's really more forward-looking now. Maybe I'm talking about 20, 30 years down the road, but I think we have this capability for modeling the nonlinear response, thermal, structural, you know, multi-physics of buildings against fire, and that is great. But right now, it still requires a lot of expertise, and it's only done for some kind of iconic structures when you have the time and money and expertise. when you have the time and money and expertise. Many people are working on other aspects of the built environment with digital tools, with numerical tools. So we have linear elastic software for the structural response, but more broadly, we have BIM. We have the ability to track the construction process. And moving forward, we need to do more about circular economy, sustainability, reusability. So probably there will be digital ecosystems to track really all the components of these buildings and how they go together and so on. I think that in the future, we should be able to, again, interface and couple and put together these different types of numerical models. And basically, I think we will move toward having digital twins for all complex objects, aircrafts, buildings, and so on. And maybe we'll have in the metaverse or whatever, we'll have the same cities that we have here. But with this digital twin object that allows us to track all the resources, components, and so on, but also to interrogate the response against extreme hazards, fire, earthquakes, and so on. And as the conditions are changing, climate is changing, we can change the stress source, and we can change the demand, and so on. But I think structural fire modeling cannot stay apart from all those other digital efforts. And basically, we should have a digital ecosystem where we put everything together for modeling buildings and ensuring they are sustainable and they are resilient. Based on my experience with how they misincorporated, actually, the structural engineering part makes a lot of sense to couple that. So maybe it's not even maybe it's not even decades maybe it's just years ahead of us to have a at least this part coupled because coupling with with cd modeling is probably a little harder because of other challenges the main being you build model for a certain purpose and architect drawing the building or engineer drawing their structural model has a different purpose than CID engineer. It's just that simple and that problematic. Absolutely. It still requires a lot of human thinking to know how to model a structure for the purpose of structural fire engineering. Because you have to think about the heat transfer problem, then the structural response. So you discretize your structure in a certain way. And it's not just lines on a sheet of paper that you can extract. You have to have a kind of information and data that today we don't have in other pieces of this digital workflow. But as I look back decades and then I look forward several decades, I'm sure we'll find solutions for this kind of challenges. But indeed, it's not trivial because, as you say, right now, each of these tools have a very specific purpose. And so you have to have an engineer who thinks about what's the right modeling approach to target this purpose. And so to harmonize that, which requires lots of research. And how do you feel about the emergence of AI as a support tool in the structural fire engineering? I'm glad you bring that up. That could definitely help. I think we are still playing with the concept and trying to see where opportunities lie. But if we start being systematic about the data and collecting and classifying the data, I don't see why AI could not help in this field the way it has helped in others, right? So I think we are still relatively in the early stage of the field of structural fire engineering, and we are still looking at these philosophical questions that you are mentioning, right? That at a high level, we still don't have really the answers about, or we do have the answers, but we have to think hard about the scenarios and the performance objectives in all cases. It's not really codified yet. But as this becomes embraced more and more, and as we move to a more systematic there, I think that AI could also come in and help. I hate doing this podcast. I ask people to talk about their fancy tools and the most impressive stuff they've done and it always ends up like we don't understand our objectives. Our safety is horrible. We need to start our objectives, guys. Come on. I want more exciting stuff in the podcast than just bragging about how we don't. But that is the sad reality. That is the unfortunate truth that we spend so much money and effort on many, many fancy things and minuscule improvements in secondary models where we don't have a fundamental question answered, like do we want our structures to resist burnout or not, and how to choose if we want it. We have not answered the question of what design fire and at what probability is good for this building and how it would be for another building. It's overwhelming, but I'm happy. We have lots of work. Future of fire engineers is bright. Well, these are complex questions, but to some extent, because there is such a multiplicity of buildings and projects and jurisdictions and everything, right? I think what is key is to really move forward in providing the tools and the framework to both approach these questions in a systematic way. Once we make the decision, we want to go that way, such as performance-based. And then the tools to enable the assessments to be rigorous and rooted in the physics. And that's really what computational modeling does, that it gives you an understanding of the physics of the problem in terms of how the fire is going to develop and then how the structure is going to respond, right? As opposed to taking a simplified model, which is very useful for benchmarking, but which does not give you these insights and the sensitivity and so on. But it's true that then you move to the higher level and it becomes a human decision problem and so we cannot formalize it the same way as engineers because you need to speak with the stakeholders and it will depend on the economics and on the social and so on. So it's true that it can seem frustrating but to some extent I think it's once you move the needle from the engineering problem to the technical social problems that it's just different considerations. I wonder if in 50 years we'll still be thinking in mindset of fire resistance and how we'll develop. I'm happy to view as this develops. Thomas, that was a great talk to you. I'm very thankful for taking me into the world of structural fire engineering. And I'm sure it was interesting, probably more interesting to non-structural fire engineers because we finally got an insight to how you guys do your job. So yeah, huge thanks. And I hope to see you here again with another interesting subject. Well, thank you, Roger. It was really my pleasure. I had lots of fun discussing and I hope to see you soon, maybe at a summer school. I would love that. Thank you very much. And that's it of this episode. I thought about making a fancy outro as usual, but in fact, the end of this discussion has pretty much covered it all. We're talking about fancy tools, AI, BIM integration and other stuff. Well, we don't have objectives and design scenarios fixed. And that's kind of devastating, really. I feel really sad about the fact that we still do not have this seemingly simple, but as Thomas said, quite complex stuff figured out. And if you're a researcher in the field and you want to find a place where you can make great impact, well, there it is. This is a much needed place for research. And while we are developing that, structural fire engineering is there to help us understand the behavior of the whole structures. I hope we've pretty well highlighted the difference between the performance of a member, performance of a single element in your building, and the performance of the whole building itself. The example of Cardington and the membrane action in the slabs is a perfect example of that. How different it is. If we just focus on performance of single members as we usually do, how do you understand the performance of the whole structure? How it will behave in the fire? Will it behave better? Will it behave worse? Luckily, the current experience is that will it behave better will it behave worse yeah luckily the current experience is that they usually behave better and thomas mentioned that these actions that were found made the buildings more robust so even some requirements could have been softened down on secondary members it's really interesting how understanding fire science can significantly improve the way how we design structures. Thomas also mentioned there's new Eurocodes coming up. And for those who don't know, Eurocodes is a series of standards in European Union. They're free to access, publicly available, and they have plenty of information on structural engineering and structural fire engineering with all modern materials. I really found interesting that he mentioned Luxembourg Annex to Eurocode, which covers glass. And I must really jump into that because it's a super interesting topic to me at this point. I hope it was not too heavy for summer break, but I guess fire science is just great. Even if it's hard, it's still great. I hope you've enjoyed this episode and I hope to see you here again next Wednesday. Thank you. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
