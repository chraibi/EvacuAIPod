 Hello everybody, welcome to Fire Science Show. If you followed last week's episode, you know exactly what's about to happen. I have interviewed Professor James Quinn Thierry on the US fire movement and the development of fire science in 70s and 80s in US and collaborations worldwide. It was quite fun, albeit a little bittersweet with the politics involved and reasons why the golden era of fire science has ended, actually, in there. Anyway, today we're coming back to these glorious times, but with a more technical approach. So I have interviewed James for another hour about technicalities of research carried at MBS or NIST now, research carried at NBS or NIST now, how these experiments were planned, how they choose the topics, who was involved, how they measured stuff. Actually, that's probably the most impressive part of it. How did they measure stuff? And wow, these guys were advanced in measuring stuff in fire and so much more careful than many of fire researchers I know myself, including. It's fascinating and inspiring to learn from James about that. I guess I'll be fine ending the intro as it is now, because I don't think I need to recommend listening to James Quinturi talking about some of the most impactful fire experiments ever conducted in history. So yeah, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski, and I will be your host.

Hello, everybody. Welcome to Fire Science Show. I'm today again with Professor James Quintieri. Hello, James. Nice to have you here again. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Warwick. Really, really happy that you've had to continue our interview. Last time we were talking a lot about the history of the U.S. fire movement, how many things were put into place, the politics that did not help that much and sometimes made destruction to the efforts of fire scientists. However, when we're discussing the mid-70s and your early days at NBS, there has been a lot of great fire science and experiments. And that's what I would like to cover in this part of the podcast. And that's what I would like to cover in this part of the podcast. So first, if you can tell me what sorts of experiments were the ones that were most interesting for you happening in 70s, mid 70s, early 80s? Well, I'm a kind of person that sees the big picture. So I would say almost all of them that dealt with physics instead of chemistry. If it dealt with flame retardants or maybe smoke particles or something like that, it didn't attract my attention as much as a flame spray and the motion of fluid in fire, and the motion of fluid in fire, pool fires, fires in compartments. So all of that kind of attracted me, and I think I spread my career over working in bits and pieces of that territory. Well, I struggle to call them bits and pieces because in your scientific curriculum, there is so many fundament papers and stuff that's absolutely fundamental to our modern understanding of fire. Calling them bits is maybe... Well, it enabled me and encouraged me to write a book to put that together and to try to create the book in terms of the bits and pieces, but to make it unified in a way. So the style of my book is more like a book on heat transfer or fluid mechanics, which tried to integrate the subject so that flame spread is not distinct from a fire plume. There's things that are in common and it becomes part of the same discipline of fire behavior. And so fire behavior, I think, was the key attractor to me, and fires in buildings. And most of the research at that time, either at NIST or in the academic field. And I would say most of it was in the academic field, focused in that territory. So they were looking at ignition, flame spread, how things burn, what's the real science ingredients of a test method, fires in compartments, what happens when a flame hits a wall, when it hits a ceiling, why are laminar flames different than turbulent flames. So all of that came into a perspective for people to work on because NIST assembled three groups in fire into one, and they brought in the research activity of the National Science Foundation, which was academia. So all of that came together, and it came together under the fire directorship of John Lyons, and people started thinking about all those bits and pieces. There were bits and pieces, and the integration of them was probably not considered it was just let's look at each individual piece and when you look at pieces what people do first is let's burn something and let's try to figure out what's going on and so that was the really the approach that people made in those 1970s. And I assume then you suddenly realized all these things interline together. One leads to another. You cannot consider flashover without understanding the ignition of a solid surface, right? Yes. I mean, you need to understand buoyancy. You need to understand heat transfer, flute mechanics. And then you need to understand how combustion comes into play in that. And one person we haven't mentioned is Brian Spaulding. Brian Spaulding, in his early work, tried to look at combustion problems in an engineering framework. In his later years, he moved to CFD because he felt that there was limitations, rightly so. But, you know, you've probably heard of the B number and the formulation of how things burn in terms of B number and Schwab-Zeldovich transformations and how you can make the equations of mass and heat transfer assemble into one. And so that foundation was there from Svalding and Zeldovich that allowed fire scientists to tap into. So that was an analytical tool that they could use. But really, to look at this for the first time, that many people were just stepping into it, they had to figure out what to look at, how to look at this for the first time, that many people were just stepping into it. They had to figure out what to look at, how to look at it. I could remember early scientists making measurements of temperature or velocity, and they were incorrect because they didn't understand that a thermocouple could have errors or that you were measuring velocity so low that their instrument wasn't capable. So there were a lot of challenges like that. But bringing all of that together at NBS was a catalyst. You've mentioned analytical tools that existed. What was the state of computational fire science at that point? Was it already the times where Howard Emmons had this first code produced? No, no, no. Howard Emmons' code grew out of the work, the early work in the 70s, in which, like even Howard Emmons himself, he would have students. He had one student, before all of this came together, look at how wood cribs burned and expanded the work of Dan Gross and Robinson from NBS and brought a theory into play. Emmons had John DeRis work on flame spread and get almost an exact solution for a post-flow flame spread. Emmons worked on a fire world, which was a phenomena not understood. Emmons had Frank Tamminini work on extinguishment of fires. And then at the same time at FM, there was work going on on pool fires, MODAC. So people were focused on all of this, and there was an acclimation of the work between FM and Harvard. That program was linked. It was funded as a link from NBS. It wasn't funded to Harvard and to FM. It was funded to Harvard and FM as a single entity. And because they had all these pieces, they decided they should put it together in a compartment fire. So they had a whole series of compartment fires with the best instrumentation to unravel what was going on in the different pieces. And that led to Emmons' concept of a zone model. Fantastic. And what was the understanding of the smoke dynamics at that point, the fire plumes, the entrainment, the layers? First of all, I think the smoke layer and the idea that you would have such a stratified atmosphere was something that was a revelation and had to be probed. But because there was this focus on fire, many people recognized it. So Tanaka in Japan recognized it, and he could make his own model. People at Illinois Institute of Technology, they got a grant from the National Science Foundation, and they could conceive of this. Emmons could conceive of it. I could do my little experiments in a compartment and start to see this. And so I could form the basis of a system model that said you have an upper layer, you have a lower layer, and you have flow through an opening. Let's conceive of the model in those terms. And now let's proceed to figure out how you get the flow in and out. What is the fire plume doing? And build from there. And so this idea of a zone model came about in several places because of the dynamic and interaction, I think, of the work. If you look at the zones, I think the distinguishment between the hot smoke zone and the free zone, you can observe that, you know. But when did you realize that the assumption that the hot zone can be considered as something unified? Like, how did you probe that? How did you validate that? Well, in the work with Stoeckler, we used aspirated thermocouple probes, which were first used, I think, at FM to try to eliminate radiation effects. At the same time, work was going on at Caltech under Ed Zukoski, and he would measure very carefully the temperature profile in a room fire, and he would measure the gas profile, and he would show how uniform it was. Now, of course, if you have a large room, like a corridor-like room, then it's going to vary as you move away from the fire. But as a first approximation, that's what you have. And in that sense, Howard Emmons was, the last thing he was trying to work on was how to extend the room to a corridor-like enclosure so you could allow for the, in the zone model, the variation in temperature longitudinally along the corridor. So there was work trying to extend that. But there's really no need to do that when you realize that Tanaka applied his own model to the World Trade Center after the bombing, and he modeled the smoke movement in the entire World Trade Center building with his own model. And Tanaka has built in wind effects. He's built in mixing effects between the layers that Ed Zukowski eliminated by his research. So the zone model concept came out of that catalyst of interaction and people watching, you know, like you said, you could see it, right? And so it's like from an engineering point of view, hey, let's model this as one zone and another zone, and they interact. They interact through the plume, and they interact through mixing. And they also interact because when the lower wall gets hot, the hot gases move up along that wall, and then they encounter a hotter layer, so now they can't penetrate, and they blur out the zone between the hot and cold layer. And there was research going on on that. So those things could be embedded into a zone model as secondary phenomena. Just like plume model is also embedded. Embedded. But of course, when you embed it, you don't have the effect of air coming in from one side, knocking the plume over. In the zone model, the plume stands up straight. But in the CFD model, the plume will bend over because it will yield to that fluid mechanics. And it might do the mixing too, but it might not because that's a viscous turbulent effect. So when designing experiments to see inside the layers, what kind of tools you had available? You said aspirating thermocouples, that I guess is quite advanced. What was your options for, for example, measuring heat fluxes? You had water-cooled gouges at that point? Yes. There were these companies like Mettherm, whose founder actually had a PhD from MIT, who developed thermopile-type heat flux sensors. There's also a Gardon-type heat flux sensor. There's also a Gardon-type heat flux sensor. A Gardon-type heat flux sensor is a thin piece of metal in which you measure the center and the edge, and that difference corresponds to the heat flux that's received. The thermopile actually acts like a thin layer, but it has the ability to measure temperature difference across that thin layer, but it has the ability to measure temperature difference across that thin layer. And from the conduction through it, you can get the heat flux. And the ThermoPile one is far superior. The Gardon gauge has some problems with it. So people would use these and there would be issues of, okay, it's water cooled. You're putting it in a bowl that's hot. Now you have a flow coming along, and it sees this cold thing, and then suddenly it sees a hot thing again. And so there's issues of heat transfer and fluid mechanics of how to really interpret that gauge. People were struggling with that. I think people forgot that today. And devices like we use today, like plate thermometers or thin skin calorimeters, they were not available. Plate thermometer is a calorimeter type gauge. It's not the guard on gauge. It's actually measuring. It's, you know, Vixram promoted this thing, but it's been there for a long time, and it can give you results. And so I've used that on occasion too. But to me, I think the thermopile gauge is probably the best. The issues with those gauges is that you need to make sure you know the emissivity of the surface and the surface doesn't get fouled up during your experiment. In addition, if you try to separate out radiation, you put a window over it and the window is now transparent but not completely to radiation. So you have that issue. You try to blow air over the window to keep soot from coming in, but it deposits anyway. So there are still issues with those gauges. Another very fundamental issue that I don't think has been resolved, and maybe ISOs tried to do this, but I don't think they succeeded, was to figure out how to find a way to calibrate these gauges. We still think about it, as you know. Yes, you think about it, and you don't have a way to do it. And when I was at NIST, there are ways to do it. There's improved techniques. There's a device called an ellipsoidal radiometer that has gold surfaces and an ellipse. And you make one focal point of the ellipse where the stuff enters, and the other focal point you have a sensor. And the gold allows you to capture everything that comes in between the two focal points. And you blow air through this thing, so you're always blowing the smoke away, so you will always get the radiation that comes in. And that's an expensive tool. If you go to MedTherm these days, the current guy that's operating that, he also has a Ph.D. from MIT, and I think he has a good understanding of these gauges. They don't tell you how they calibrate them, but they probably have a black body someplace. And in my days at NIST in the 70s, I went to the people who did radiometry measurements for light and things like that at NBS. So they were very accomplished and understood the spectral aspects and emissivities. And they calibrated a thermopile gauge for me that I bought from Medtherm. And they calibrated it up to, I think, I don't know, maybe two kilowatts per meter squared. They couldn't go beyond, they couldn't go beyond a certain. So they calibrated two of these for me, and then I inherited a light source that gave me ability to get to 100 kilowatts per meter squared. And so as long as I had a paint on this sensor that was an emissivity of one, and I did. There was a special paint that gave you an emissivity of like 0.98. I had these two things calibrated, and although they were calibrated at a low heat flux, we could show that the thermopile gauge works in a linear way. So if you go to higher heat flux, it's linear. And you could show that scientifically from the theory of that gauge. So we developed this technique, and it stays at NIST to this day. However, after I left NIST, they lost one of the sensors, and they used the sensor to give to anyone in the cone that wants to calibrate their cone. And so this sensor that is supposed to be in a lockbox is distributed to people to use. Now, when you have a calibration source, you develop transfer standards. So people haven't done that. The FAA, which I've done work here, I'm in New Jersey right now, they went to MedTherm and they got assurances that they would get the right calibration. So in recent years, I took the sensor I had, which came from NIST, you know, traceable to NIST, and theirs that was traceable to mettherm, and they were within 5%. So that's the kind of confidence level I have today in those sensors. But I do think that a lot of people should pay attention to how they calibrate them. That's astonishing. It seems you may even, like you definitely had a higher comprehension of this. Well, we worried about stuff like that in those days. Like, Bernie McCaffrey wondered, what's the best way to measure velocity? That was my next question. He said, I could do it with a pitot tube. I know a pitot tube is, now, if he did it with a hot wire and put it in a fire plume, it may not survive. And the error that you would get from the soot collection or the buoyancy effect on the thing, there would be problems. So he went to the pitot tube. But then later on, he went to the bidirectional probe, particularly if we looked at doorway flows, because Heskos had developed had developed that if he wanted to measure a doorway flow he didn't want to have two pitot tubes there so he made the bidirectional probe which works on the same principle as the pitot tube in place of two pitot tubes in different directions. So to give a better context to listeners so we're here talking about compartment fire dynamics. We just said that you had two layers. We discussed how temperatures were measured in layers. The second most important thing is the opening at which the exchange of mass between the compartment and the exterior happens. So you really need to very precisely quantify the flow in and flow out in both in terms of temperatures and terms of the volumetric flows. So that's a challenging measurement even today. And I think what you are now describing, the bidirectional probe, is still the standard approach. Well, it's a way to do it. But at that time period, someone like Bernie McCaffrey said, okay, Heskestat developed this, but how does it work compared to the pitot tube? What coefficient do I need for this bidirectional probe? How is it affected by the angle of the flow or the direction of the velocity if it doesn't hit it straight on? And so people were concerned about that because if you put this thing in a doorway flow, you see right away that if flow is coming out, the flow goes down over the soffit and then goes back up again. So you have that probe now in a way where the flow is actually changing direction very strongly. And so is it measuring the flow accurately then? And so we looked at all those issues. You know, and Ed Zukoski was another guy that took pains to make sure he had the right measurements. And so measurement techniques were important and their validity based on how they were calibrated or how they should be interpreted. Were the experiments on the ceiling jets also carried at NIST at that time? No, the ceiling jet was done. It was probably motivated by John DeRis, and he gave Ron Alpert his kind of baptism into fire by working on the ceiling jet. kind of baptism into fire by working on the ceiling jet. And so Ron cobbled together an analysis of a plume to the jet. And there's been, you know, work on it since. But even Spalding said to me one time, he says the jet will relaminarize. And so these are still issues that people haven't fully looked at. Now, one thing from the ceiling jet work that Ron Alpert did is very useful for fire investigators or fire engineers. And that is that a kind of a useful, simple rule that comes out of the ceiling jet is the ceiling jet takes up 10% of the room height. So if you don't have a sprinkler or a detector in that region near the ceiling of 10%, it's not going to work. So very useful stuff came out of Ron Alpert's work. But if you go to extend that and try to extend it to flame length under a ceiling, there's still work that needs to be done. And that work stopped. How about entrainment? McCaffrey did experiments on fire plumes with an immense amount of different fire plumes. How was entrainment captured by you? From McCaffrey measurements, he measured the distribution in a plume. Of velocity? He measured the velocity across the radius at different heights. So if he did that, he got the temperature and velocity over that radius. Then he could integrate that and get mass flow. However, at the edges, he had big errors. So he did not put a lot of faith in his entrainment interpretation from those measurements. Don't tell me that my whole career is on that, on this. No, no. The entrainment work, the good entrainment work comes from Ed Zukowski, the good entrainment work comes from edzukowski and beiler picked it up as a another student with emmons edzukowski conceived of this thing that if you have a hood and you're extracting gases from it and you put a fire plume below it the fire plume will go and fill the hood and some will spill over, right? Okay. But if you contain that fire plume in the hood and you don't get any spillover, essentially the plume is going into that layer and the flow is coming out the top. And so if you vary the height of the flame, you could get entrainment at different levels in the flame by that calorimetry type technique. And so Zukowski perfected that and showed that could be an accurate way of making the measurement. And then Beiler and other people probably picked it up. But the best measurements come from Zukoski. Fantastic. I think Zukoski did it at different sizes, all right? Some people do it for a point source. It can't work for a point source. You have to get some measurements and then extrapolate it to a virtual origin and do things like that. But Zukowski actually had measurements of different sizes. And again, if you try to take in the effective size, you can get an equation that covers most of the data. And I think it's in my book someplace. One of my students helped integrate all of that data. But there still needs to be work done there because you have a big pool fire. A big pool fire is basically laminar at the base. So its entrainment is totally different than after you get beyond that region. Now, if FDS is giving you the answer to all of that, is it good in that laminar range as well as in the turbulent range? I don't know. So those problems still are out there today. And because people use CFD, they think they got it all already when they may not. See, because before CFD, you would focus more on the experiment, and you say, look what's happening down there at the bottom. That's laminar, but I'm analyzing this as a turbulent plume. How can my answer be right down at the bottom? And so that's swept away now. Very, very interesting. CFD prevents us from looking there because we say, look, we got it down there. It looks laminar. The lack of full-scale research is‚Ä¶ It's not full-scale. You could do work on a plane spread on a napkin and still not fully understand it. That's challenging. Well, I mean, you go to the work of flame spread, right? Concurrent flame spread is still complicated because it involves turbulent radiation from that flame. But a post-flow flame spread is more simple because it's a very kind of stable laminar flame moving along. And Fernandez-Peyo, when you, hopefully you'll interview him, and he could give you the history of that and how they had to include oxygen effects and velocity effects at the leading edge in terms of a damculler number. And so work like that was going on but then it stopped we got cfd we get everything now i i don't know but you know upward flame spread is still even upward burning the only people i saw that did upward burning to match experiments done at FM Global and done by Jerry Faith are using the FireFoam code from FM Global, Ning Ren and Yi. I mean, they produced good results, but they had to get that turbulent boundary layer working. And I'm still not sure how this handles that. Now to go back to the experimental design, I think at some point of the interview you've referred to them as box buildings. So how you were constructing them, how were you choosing the configurations to go? Were you starting with a very simple configuration of a compartment, corridor, mixing them? What was the logic behind that? Well, again, these things were motivated by certain things. When I got my feet wet in fire at NIST, it was looking at these corridor fires involving floor covering materials. So there was a room in the corridor. You said that was an effect of a fire that happened and blocked people. Yes, there was a fire in a nursing home in Pennsylvania. And another source of funding at that time was the housing department in the U.S. government, and they gave a lot of money to NIST to study those fires. So where one side of NIST and fire had money directly through NIST, which would be almost full funding, the other side of the NIST fire program needed to rely on projects like that. And they were able to get some really big long-term projects to look at things like that. So both sides motivated each other. You know, you could see these big fires going on and other people are saying, oh, wow, I never saw that before. So we were constantly in a learning mode and we had a lot of stimulation. When looking at that research, correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't see any research on vehicle fires. What kind of fires? Vehicle fires, like cars in garage. Vehicle fires. Yeah? Yes, there weren't. Yes, because at that time the focus was flashover, fire tests, are they doing a good job with materials? Are they causing flashover? So the focus was room fires. Fires in cars only became like an anecdote when they discovered that the statistics on people dying in car fires was off by a factor of 10. And so immediately the death rate in fire in the U.S. went from 8,000 a year to 4,000. By correcting the vehicle, okay. Yes, and fires in motor vehicles, to give you perspective, is 40,000. And today, I think the number might be 4,000 for fire in the U.S. today. So no one worries about fire anymore. Well, I think now with the electric vehicles, it became a trendy topic again. Well, yes, but they'll solve that problem because, look, we're using gasoline in vehicles for over a century. Which is kind of flammable. Yes, worse than the batteries batteries because always they're flammable. The batteries are only going to be a problem if they have a fatal flaw when they were made or if there's an accident. And the reason is if you have one go bad, they'll all go bad because the battery is only this big. It's like a AA battery. And Tesla has thousands of these things in their cars. So they'll figure out a way to prevent it. Your research, this era of research at NIST also coincided with increased use of plastics. Yes, that's why the fire service started to say, hey, we're seeing fires occur a lot faster. We can't get there fast enough. And somehow they're growing faster. And so people started to say plastics and people started to say test methods. So the focus of this early science research was on fires developing fast in a room, flash over, and how do test methods behave? So a lot of the research was focused on how does the so-called tunnel test in the U.S. with fire down a tunnel-like thing with a fire on a ceiling, how is that really working? How does the cup burner work? How does fire on a rod work? How does the UL test for, you know, upward spread on a little material work? So there was focus on those things too, And that's what prompted work on flame spread. But you were trying to incorporate that with the full compartment size test, like the time to flash over the spread on the carpet. So it was not just the material properties. It was a full scale physics of the whole compartment that fire, right? I think the focus on room fires, yes, flashover was a motivator in what that was. But when people started modeling the fire, they didn't think they could put in all the aspects of fire spread and do that correctly. They were still looked at independently, where some people use FDS to model fire spread in a building today. I mean, you can do that, but there's a group called, there used to be a meeting annually, internationally, where people came from all different places to show how they applied FDS. And I think Kevin McGratton would cringe when he saw it. Yeah, I also have very limited belief in modeling fire spread in FDS. There are tricks that you can apply, simplifications you can make, so it looks realistic. You can do it. You can use the code to do that. But the question is, are you getting the right answer? Just a turbulent burning wall. When I saw FM do that with their fire foam and do that correctly to the data, then I was impressed. More like that should be, in my opinion, should be done. I completely agree to that. You have work by Kiseki done under Hirano, which are big fires, and they show many aspects of these big pool fires. I challenge the CFD people to reproduce that data. I still think even reproducing something as simple, if I may, as temperatures in fire compartments, that's already a challenge. Like whenever I see a paper that is a CFD paper and they show me a comparison with experiment and they show, you know, this perfect alignment of temperature between CFD and experiment. Between CFD and an experiment, my first thought is that this is either made up or a mistake because it's almost impossible to get this correct. Well, maybe it's not impossible if you design the experiment to fit the CFD model. Okay, this way, yes. If you design the experiment so it's based on the strengths of the CFD model, then you might get good results. I'm not saying CFD is wrong. I'm saying that there's aspects of it that need to be improved, especially for something like fire. One interesting thing about the experiments you've carried at NBS that we're discussing today, today your experiments, for example, the one done with Steckler about the fires in compartments, but also the corridor compartment experiments, these are staple validation cases for today's models. Was this your intention? Have you foreseen that 40 years later, people will still refer to those as the validation points? No, but I am impressed with, you know, there were CFD models before FDS, some of them out of Imperial College, and the Stekler experiments that we did were the basis of trying to validate those CFD models. of trying to validate those CFD models. And as I said, the last time I had a look at this with a student and we used FDS, in the first shot we didn't get it right because we stopped the grid at the doorway. And then the students went on further and extended the grid outside the doorway and got some improved results. I forget the details of that, but it's published someplace. But we didn't think it was going to be the basis to validate CFD models. It was to get a fundamental understanding because before that, the only results that were kind of over a wide range of conditions was done by Emmons and Joe Prowl, which were using water and salt water. So they were using water and salt water on a smaller scale. And we wanted to look at the large scale system. And out of the small scale results, Emmons showed that as you change the Reynolds number or something, you've got a different flow coefficient to make the correction and work right. And so we wanted to see if that would hold up in more full scale realistic flow conditions. That was more the motivation to try to extend this work. Emmons did it in a nice cute way. We wanted to see if we could use, at that time, the instrumentation that we were using was pressure transducers that allowed us to measure in that low range accurately, and they were expensive. And I think it took me three years before I could buy enough of them to use in Stekler's experiment. How many was there? Like 10, 20? We might have had about 10. And then to measure the temperatures right, we used work that was done at FM to investigate the accuracy of aspirated thermocouples, where you put a thermocouple in a tube and you suck air over it. So when the air comes into that tube, you're measuring really the air temperature at a high velocity over the thermocouple. But if you just put the thermocouple in bare and you have a fire and hot walls, it's seeing radiation. How deep is the thermocouple into the tube? Is it at the beginning of the tube? Is it deep into? It's at the beginning of the tube. So it's just a shielded thermocouple that aspirates? It's a shielded thermocouple, yes. I mean, you could make a thermocouple with a lot of baffles on it too, but then the baffles get hot. Okay. And it radiates. Okay. And it radiates. Or you could use, you know, different size wires. And I think we tried different techniques, and we said, oh, this technique is the best. And so when we did those experiments, we tried to do it in the best way possible, tried to align the bidirectional probes where the flow was going to be horizontal, you know, even though it's changing like this. And so we did the best we could. Those experiments were done not on the NIST campus. They were done at a site that NIST inherited from a missile defense site with underground missiles. And so we got a building on those grounds where we could do this experiment and leave it set up for the whole time. Okay. That took some politics, too. In the missile pits, later on, they were doing work on, I think Dave Evans was doing work on ceiling jets because it was a very quiet environment underground. So we had this extra, because I could not build a full-scale room at NIST. And if I went to the place where we had the big laboratory, we couldn't exhaust that easily. I mean, so it was tricky. So we got permission to do these fire experiments, clean fires, and we could move the fire plume around so we could show the effect of when you put it near a door or near a wall or, you know, you would get different results. And so it was really gratifying work. The technician involved in that, Bill Rankinen, now lives in, I think, northern Michigan on Lake Superior. His heritage is from Finland, and he became very close to Matty Kokkola when Matty Kokkola came and spent time with us. So in the 80s, when I had my group, I invited a lot of people from abroad to come and integrate with our group and work. And Matty Kokkola has, with his work and maddie coquilla has with this guy bill rankin and they did experiments of flames on ceilings that have all kinds of shapes you maybe you could see pictures of them someplace but they're quite remarkable and again i don't think anybody has reproduced them by CFT. Beautiful. One thing I wanted to ask you, like, given the modern technology we got today, my generation of fire experimentators, you know, laser velocimetry, fantastic calorimetry devices, FTIR spectrometers that you can integrate into your smoke exhausts. that you can integrate into your smoke exhausts, multi-wave. But I saw when they were looking at FTIR results for toxicity, the laboratories couldn't get consistent measurements. You know that? I didn't know that. To the people on the toxicity committee. I'm actually going to have David Purser soon into the podcast. I'll ask him about that. I don't think FTIR was current in David Purser soon into the podcast. I'll ask him about that. I don't think FDIR was current in David Purser's time, but please say hello to him. I will. I will. But Jim, the question is, like, if you could, like, pick one tool of the modern fire science and try and travel it to the 80s, like, what do you think is the coolest thing we have now that you struggled with in the past that way maybe we don't appreciate well when you mentioned lasers there there are many ways of the combustion people have learned how to measure things in flames inside the inside flames even look at uh the temperature at points and things like that. So there are many laser type diagnostic techniques that allow you to see things in flames that probably people should start applying to fire. You have mentioned research like Prowl and Emmons flows through openings. That's actually one of my favorite research pieces from 1975. Amazing piece and fundamental piece of research for practical for engineering. The Prowl and Emmons work. Yeah. Saltwater. And again, with Steckler, we looked at saltwater work later on. In fact, my colleague, Andre Marshall at Maryland, when he joined Maryland, he got the saltwater tank that I salvaged from this because they were going to throw it away. And he did very fundamental work. And he did work on ceiling jets in which he did it with saltwater. And he did work on ceiling jets in which he did it with salt water. And he measured the velocity and salt concentration so he could relate it to temperature. And that work is quite unique and advanced for its time. But it was never extended. Look at what Marshall did with salt water on ceiling jets. And that was like an extension of all of this work from the 70s and 80s. And someone like Andre Marshall, when he came to Maryland, appreciated that. That's why I think the Chinese are going to get into it, because when I see papers by young Chinese students, I see that they're reading the literature very carefully. Now, whether their supervisor is forcing them to do this, or they're doing it based on their own kind of motivation and the resources that exist around them at USTC, they seem to have a respect and an embracement of that work. If they have that and they carry it forward, I see that there's a linkage there that should improve fire research through the work in China. I hope we don't go to war before that time. Please, enough politics in here. I hope that's not the case ever, or it's horrible. What I've meant when I started this is this... We need to study history. Of course. But I think they're finishing this episode on this on this beautiful experiments you've you've conducted at nbs that that were cornerstone for many further achievements of fire science well one experiment that i i didn't mention is work by jerry faith on turbulent wall fires okay and he had a student i think that student passed away early, but he did work on turbulent wallfires. First, he did like just plumes, hot plumes along the wall. Then he did the laminar fire along the wall. So he did, you know, can I get data for a laminar fire against the wall. And how did he make those fires? He made them in a simple way. He wanted to predict the burning rate of those fires. So he used liquid fuel embedded into the wall where he could then know the evaporation thermodynamics of that liquid, which is very simple kind of evaporation. You don't have to worry about pyrolyzing wood. And so if he knew that, he knew the burning rate very, very well. And so then they developed a theory for the laminar flame using B-number type model. flame using B-number type model. And they measured the temperature very carefully with fine thermocouples and the velocity with, I think they used hot wire. But Jerry Faith was a really excellent, I mean, he was unbelievable. He was the editor of Combustion and Flame. He was the editor of a journal in fluid mechanics. He was remarkable person. And so this was very careful work. And then they extended it to the turbulent field above it with the same student. And they made the same measurements and they made the same and they had a turbulent model that they used and got reasonable predictions, even though they realized that there was a lot of radiation in those flames, and they swept that under the rug a little bit. But that's a point where someone needs to go further. You see, like the next step would have been, let's see how we could bring in the radiation. Let's see how we could predict it. How is that a function of the fuel we're burning? Can it be generalized? Can we get a simple equation, or do we have to resort to CFD every time we want to learn something? Those steps never were taken anymore. I hope there are a lot of young researchers listening who seek their careers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there is so many experiments that need to either a step further or maybe a revisit with a friendly update in the specs. Like any field, if you throw money at it, people will do stuff. People are not throwing enough money at fire. They're throwing money at batteries now, but I don't think the industry cares, just like the plastic industry didn't care. So fire research in plastic was byproduct of, like you said, the fines they got. The use of plastics was a technological change in the way we live that enabled fire to develop in different ways. And so that was the spark, really. Just like batteries are now the spark that are saying, you know, we should do more fire research in batteries. saying, you know, we should do more fire research in batteries. So there will always be new technologies that come about that will, you know, maybe people will invent fusion. And with those high temperatures, there will be a lot of fires. We'll see. One thing I've learned after two years of doing this podcast, we create issues in fire quicker than we generate solutions and people who can solve them. So we're not going to get out of job anywhere soon. No, the people in combustion may lose their jobs, but the people in fire will not. Because, and as I said, as investigators embrace this and the fire service embraces it, fire research should grow. Beautiful. Let's end this episode with this thought. Maybe one more thing. I'll maybe publish it separately. Like if you had a message to young people just coming into fire. There's so many young people coming into fire science, more than ever before. So many faculties open, so many good places to pursue career in fire? Well, it's a stimulating field, and it's a field that is rich in undiscovery, so you can do a lot to contribute to it. But the reality is that I think a lot of young people have graduated through fire research curriculum, but they don't stay in the field because the field is not embracing them. What a shame. If you ask how many fire protection engineering firms hire fire scientists or people who did maybe a somewhat arcane to them research topic in fire they won't be the first on their list to hire so so the field is not in need of science the field is in need of tools to how to solve problems well we can use scientists too yes and the way that works is like, you know, if somebody says, let's go to the moon, and people throw money on that, then you figure out how to get off this planet. But as soon as somebody says, who cares about the moon, you see what happens. And fire is in that vein. It's a drag on the economy. It's not a promotion of economy. economy. It's not a promotion of economy. So it's not like inventing a new thing and everything takes off and now you have Silicon Valley. Fire degrades from commerce and economics. It's a drag. It's a loss. But that's why I said if the fire service community, the firefighters, wake up and say, we need better tools and we need science, that may be the savior. Lund is the only program that realizes this, that educates their people, and then they go into the fire service. So that is one seed that I haven't seen grow beyond Lund. Now, James, I see some promising seeds. Fire Safety Research Institute, UL. I really believe. You know, I commend those guys. I really believe this is a thing. And, yeah, let's hope. Well, I hope that your prediction that the golden era is still in front of us. It's there. I mean, look, it took Pottle and Emmons a long time to get, you know, some activity going in fire. So it's there. Fire is always going to exist on this planet. And as the need to understand it grows, the science will grow. Fantastic. Thank you very much. And that's it. This concludes the whole interview I had with Professor James Quintieri. I'm really thankful to James for spending so much time with me and sharing so much of his thoughts about the U.S. fire science, how it developed, how it's grown, the US fire science, how it developed, how it grown, how it changed over the years, and maybe some inspiration in how we can go back to the glorious times of the fire science research. In today's episode, we've talked a lot about how the experiments were carried, and I think a good message to everyone listening, the researchers listening, is that many of those experiments are done in 80s like 40 years ago and they are still the staple cases for validating our models it's it's astonishing what long-lasting impact you can achieve with carefully planned experiments and really well thought out fire science it's a statement that's very contradictory to the modern science where you're pushed to get papers published quickly, publish as many as you can, hopefully with high impact factors. Look, this is like the exact opposite end of spectrum, doing a very carefully planned experiment, maybe taking a year or two, doing that, publishing a single paper, which still 40 years later is the basis of models. How amazing is that? If I had to choose between writing a really, really good paper that will continue making impact in a few decades and popping salami slices of research, I would highly recommend doing the former. I guess this is something we try with our fire science at ITB. I'm not sure if we always accomplish that. We'll see in a few decades. But yeah, that's something I aspire to. And I highly recommend that to any academic around. And I hope this interview with James can serve as an inspiration on how to achieve that. Thank you very much for tuning in to The Fire Science Show. And there's more great episodes coming your way. So see you here next Wednesday. Bye. This was The Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
