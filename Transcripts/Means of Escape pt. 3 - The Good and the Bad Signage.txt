 It can be really, really tricky to find a design that works. Often you have an idea, but one of the problems is that as a fire engineer, you're a bit biased. So you're thinking fire and evacuation, and that's the filter that you apply when you look at your design. So the only thing you will see is an evacuation exit, a really clear evacuation exit, Wężyński. I'm a professor at the Building Research Institute, ITB, in Poland. I specialize in fire, and despite two decades of professional engagement in this field, every day I find something new and surprising about fire safety engineering. And that's also the case of the material presented in this podcast episode. But first things first, this podcast series is produced together with Halliwell Fire Research, a global company specialized in forensic fire science, expert witness services, and also research development and design of evacuation in buildings. Thank you. What are the ignition sources? What things can ignite? This exit space so that occupants can escape to their safety. Where do we get our data on occupant movement and how do we model that? And how do we model that for complex buildings? In the second one, we've talked about the building systems. How does the building support the evacuees in their escape from the most fundamental signaling alarm systems through suppression, smoke control? Thank you. use it and the interaction between the system and the building occupant that makes or breaks its performance. In the episode 3, we go further into that rabbit hole as we will discuss what makes system good and useful. In many codes and standards, in many law jurisdictions, you're only told to install something, install a smoke alarm, install a sprinkler system. We often are not guided clearly on what exactly should we install. In some cases, when we are talking about technical solutions, we have our specialized codes that you can follow, and you can be sure that if you do it by the code, the design should work properly, it should provide sufficient safety to the building occupants, and also, you know, from a legal perspective, the engineer has done their job according to something we refer to as the industry standard. There's not much liability unless one has made a mistake. However, in other cases, when we think about simple aspects of our design, such as the color of the doors, the way how the frame of the doors will look like, where do you place your evacuation signage, what color does it have, and when you have a flashy light to indicate something to the building occupants, how often should it flash, how bright should it be, and in what color should that be. You'll not find a clear industry standard on those. And there's multiple ways how an engineer can design their systems. And to design it properly, you have to really try to build up some understanding of human behavior and perception. And in it, with perception, we will start. Let's first talk about how people perceive the fire. Because once a person witnesses a fire, there's a ton of decisions they have to make. But to make those decisions, they have to evaluate, is this fire dangerous? Is this something that I act against? Is this something that makes me evacuate? And perception of fire itself can be quite challenging. Let's start our journey with Josh Gibbons, researcher at the Halliwell Fire Research, with whom we'll again come back to the Bevel Hills Supper Club fire that we've discussed in the previous episodes. In terms of understanding fire growth, it can be quite challenging even for a fire engineer. So for the layperson, we are typically quite good at maybe understanding linear relationships. But as we know, fires grow exponentially. And so it's quite often that risk perception or understanding the risk can be a lot lower than the actual fire incident in front of you. You can quite easily underestimate how fast the fire growth is. And I guess the part as well is also prevalent in the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire was hazard proximity. So if you can't see smoke, you can't feel any of the effects of fire, can't see the fire, then I guess you have a very lower risk perception. And in the case of the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, the fire really surprised a lot of the people in the cabaret room. They were initially delayed in terms of when they could get notification. As I said before, there was no automatic fire alarm system, no sounders. So it was really word of mouth spreading out through the facility to warn people of the fire, especially those in the cabaret room. And so they were quite delayed until they got their notification of when to evacuate verbally, which was actually quite remarkable. It was a busboy that stood up on stage who was petrified of public speaking, but hopped up onto the stage and then grabbed the microphone from some of the comedians that were on stage performing at the time and then instructed everyone to get out. There was a fire in the building. And then not long after the busboy got up on stage, that's when some really thick black smoke started to roll into the cabaret room. And so at that point, then obviously the hazard proximity increased and that's when people understood the severity. But at that point, it was also severe overcrowding. And unfortunately, that's how a lot of people lost their lives was trying to then escape. So now we may start putting all the puzzles together of the Beverly Hills Super Club fire tragedy. In the first episode we've learned that it was overcrowded and didn't have sufficient exit route capacity. In the second one we've learned that it didn't really have much of the building systems that can make it safer. And now we've learned that the realization that there is a fire in the building and that this fire is actually quite dangerous came a little bit too late. From tragedies like this, we learn that risk perception is a critical component of the decision-making process. But to study it, we need a more systematical approach and we need to do it in the laboratory. To tell me how it's done, I've invited once again Professor Daniel Nielsen from the University of Canterbury and the director at the Halliwell Fire Research. We've done studies on risk perception of fires. So what we did in those studies was that people got to see a fire developing, and then after a we stopped the video and then we showed them a video of fire sometime later. And then we asked them to estimate how long was it between this fire that you just saw and then this image of the fire or this video of the fire sometime later. And what we saw from the study is that people are really bad at estimating fire growth. And we did this first with students, and then we did it with a more general population. So people are really bad at estimating fire growth, which means they can't really extrapolate from a small fire to a really big fire. And that's a problem, since they don't necessarily see a small fire as a risk. They might see a big fire as a risk, so something that is big and in front of them and the size of them. Many people will definitely see that as a fire risk, but at that point, it's actually too late to evacuate, or it's sort of very dangerous to evacuate when you have a huge fire. So once they realize that a fire is dangerous, it might actually be too late. And the reason for that is that the small fire is really difficult for people to extrapolate to the big fire. Now, we've had incidents where we've seen this. So people have watched a fire growing. One of the problematic things that contribute to the lack of risk perception is if someone tries to extinguish the fire. So, for example, the Stardust nightclub fire, there was a fire and there were some extinguishing attempts from staff to extinguish the fire initially in the very early stages. And it seems that that almost gives a false sense of security for people. Like someone is dealing with the fire, it's probably going to be okay. So if this is a staff member, they probably know what they're doing. But if they don't manage to extinguish the fire and people are just standing watching the extinguishing attempts, then when the fire grows, they don't have as much time as if they would have evacuated really quickly when the fire was really, really small. So in summary, people have difficulty estimating how a small fire grows into big fire. So they have real difficulty estimating the time they would have until a fire becomes dangerous, which means that they have lacking risk perception. They see the fire for what it is. A small fire is not dangerous to me. I don't have to act. And then a big fire is dangerous to me. I have to act. But at that point, it's too, since the fire is big and they have limited possibility to evacuate. One more aspect that comes into risk perception is how big fire can I extinguish? When we think about responsibilities and liabilities in fires, it's often expected that people will attempt an extinguishing of the fire. In many fire safety strategies, extinguishing action would be considered, and even in the Valley Hills Supper Club, fire extinguishers, Thank you. what fire can an extinguisher take down? And just ask the perception of when a fire becomes dangerous, the perception of which fire can be extinguished by a small means of a hand extinguisher is also very difficult. Once again, Daniel Nielsen. I think people in general have a difficult time understanding how big of a fire they can extinguish. Now, one of the problems related to that is that that depends very much on the type of extinguisher you have available. So if you have a carbon dioxide extinguisher, there's a certain fire size you can extinguish. If you have a powder extinguisher, it's actually a huge fire that you can extinguish, but you need to know how to do it. So people have difficulty estimating how big of a fire that they can extinguish with a fire extinguisher. And it is quite hard to know if you're a layperson since you don't even know, potentially, what type of extinguisher you're holding. So it becomes quite tricky for them to estimate it. One of the things that we have seen, one of the problems when people try to extinguish fires is that they typically stand too far away from the fire and try to spray into the fire, but they should actually take a step closer and use less extinguishing medium rather than taking a step back and using the whole extinguisher, since that's less efficient. You need to get close to the fire and try and hit the base of the fire to extinguish it. So this is a problem that we've seen that people seem to take a step back and not really get close to the fire, which means that the fire extinguisher is less efficient than it could have been. So once a hazard is recognized, there are multiple choices a person can make. What choices they make, of course, depends on how do they perceive the hazard in front of them. And our knowledge on that comes from studying responses of the survivors of fires. But we also have some modern means to study that in a more controlled environment. Once again, I've invited Luke Deschott from Hallowell Fire Research to tell me about the history of surveying building occupants and the modern approaches that we can use today to study this in depth. So one of the famous or infamous fires we have is the CMGM Grand Hotel Fire. So that was in the 90s in Nevada where sadly a bunch of people died. One of the interesting findings from that fire was a person by the name of John Bryan, in conjunction with the NFPA, gathered a lot of information from survivors from that fire. So he sent out a questionnaire to them and asked how they became aware of the fire, what some of their actions were when the fire occurred. So we have a virtual reality scenario that's been built out of Lund University, but we're still using it here in the University of Canterbury as well to try and enhance it and see what other conclusions we can draw from that. So we can drop a person into a hotel room. Obviously, it's not a hotel room from the 1980s. It's a more modern one because that would be a little weird for people to go back in time. But then we can start to provide them with some of these fire cues that people observed that were exposed to in the actual fire and see if they carry out some of those same actions that they did back in 1980. And we can use multisensory different types of stimulus to people. So we can expose them to a visual fire cue so they can see smoke coming through the vents and see what can happen. We also have different smells. So one of the postdocs in the lab, Humayun Khan, has developed what he calls the pod. So it's a small servo that drives down a smell simulator, I would say, so you can smell the smell of smoke, and it's actually quite compelling. And the future works there are going to be incorporating some sort of radiant heating as well so so people can get multiple different sensors to really enhance their experience and see effectively how close you can get to reality and see if we can gain some valuable insights from participants using VR. So with those research means we are capable of investigating how people react to the fire and what do they do after they're informed that the fire is in their presence. Now, one could assume that once the people are informed and make a conscious decision to evacuate, they should simply look for the nearest exit sign, look for the evacuation pathway, escape door, and just follow the signs and get out of the building. But once again, the perception aspect comes here. So the question is, is it enough that an evacuation sign is there? How do people react to those signs? Do they even see them? And if they do, do they understand and follow their guidance? For more information on that, I'm back to Professor Daniel Nielsen. Now, what we often use in buildings to get people to use and recognize and see emergency exits is the emergency exit sign. Now, the assumption is that people in an evacuation situation should see these signs and they should understand that that's an exit and they should use it. Now, what we've seen in research is that people don't always look for emergency exit signs. And this is linked to a theory called the theory of learned irrelevance. Now, the theory of learned irrelevance tells us that people in everyday use of a building, they only, or they teach their brain to only process the things that they use in everyday use of the buildings. So, for example, if you're using a building and you're never using emergency exits to get out of the building, since it's an alternative exit, the brain basically programs itself to not look for that exit. Since if you looked for the exit and you always processed it, then the brain would be overloaded. So things we don't need, we do not cognitively perceive. Now, what happens in an evacuation situation? Well, we don't really change that much. We're still programmed to not necessarily look for emergency exit signs. So in an evacuation situation, we don't see them or we don't perceive them, at least. We might look at them, but the brain doesn't necessarily process it. And that's the theory of learned irrelevance. And that explains partly why people don't use emergency exits. We've done experiments on this in a hotel building where we put eye track on people and we told them to go up to the 16th floor and explore the hotel. We didn't actually tell them there would be an evacuation alarm. But as they were exploring the hotel room, we started the alarm. And then we looked at their movements out from the hotel room and how they tried to find the emergency exits. And as they were wearing eye track, we could see exactly what they were looking at. And it was surprising to me how little they looked for emergency exits. So when they tried to find their way out, they looked at other things, like they looked for doors, they looked for handles, but not necessarily for emergency exit. But those experiments were not carried just to satisfy the researchers' interest in where do people look at when they evacuate. They also have a practical goal. As mentioned in the beginning of this episode, the codes often tell us to use a solution, but we can use it in a good way or in a bad way. In this case, understanding how people perceive the escape routes and evacuation signs may perhaps allow us to create better signs and better routes. So they actually help people escape the building. That's the thing that our codes do not account for. That's something that you will not find an industry standard for. It's something that a good fire engineer could do. But I'll agree, it's not something that we do every day. Now on some ideas how you can make the signage better. Once again, Professor Daniel Nielsen. Now, what does help when you try and attract people's attention to emergency exits is if you use a dynamic system. So a dynamic system is something that activates when the alarm goes off. So what we've tested in the past is green flashing lights next to an emergency exit. And what happens in an emergency situation when the alarm goes off and then this green light starts flashing, then that's something new and novel and it attracts the attention of the people. They look at the sign much more when you have flashing lights and then they understand what the sign means and the theory is that they then find exits more effectively. So in some type of facilities like cinema theaters, I've done experiments in cinema theaters where we got everyone to use the alternative exit since we had green flashing lights next to the emergency exit sign. So it can be a very powerful tool to get people to use the exits that they would ordinarily not use. And we have many more examples of good and bad practices in guiding people towards the exit. But to understand them better, we first need to put one more fundamental piece of knowledge out there to help us understand why, what makes them good or bad. It's called the theory of affordances. And it's explained to me by Luke Deschott and Professor Daniel Nielsen. So one way of thinking about designs of egress components, so these are things like doors, exit signage, emergency markings, as in terms of what we can call the theory of affordances. This theory was created by James Gibson back in the 60s. So Gibson was a psychologist who did a lot of research in the field of visual perception or the way that we perceive the world around us. It's an interesting word, affordances. It doesn't really make a lot of sense, but it's a term that considers what the environment around somebody can offer or what it provides to us. And it's really a complementary sort of thing between the animal or the person and the environment around them. So according to Gibson, people perceive objects in terms of what they can offer or afford, probably best explained with an example. So think about a footpath, for example, as something that is flat and hard, but we can also consider it as something that can afford a purpose like walking on or running. So an affordance is really what the object or thing or environment offers the individuals in relation to how they want to fulfill their goal. And affordances can change depending on the goals that we have. So one of the goals that we may have in a fire emergency is to escape. And so this goal obviously has implications for exit design. Any components of egress, emergency exits, for example, should ideally provide us affordances that support the escape objective. So, for example, it needs to be clearly marked, it needs to be easily distinguished from the surroundings, and it also needs to be easy to open and intuitive to operate. So the theory of affordances stipulates that there are four types of affordances. One is sensory, and that is the design features of the exit design that makes it easy to see. So, for example, contrast could be an example of this. If a door has the same color as the wall or the same structure as the wall, it offers poor sensory affordance. So, as an engineer, you can look at an exit design and you can systematically analyze the type of sensory affordances it provides. The next type of affordance is cognitive affordance, which is how it's understood. So, for example, if you look at an exit and it's clear that you should use it in an emergency, then it provides clear cognitive affordance. The next affordance is physical affordance. That's about using it. So things like a handle that is easy to operate, the fact that you don't have to push really, really hard to open the door. So the fact that it's easy to operate would be the physical affordance. The final affordance is the functional affordance, and that is the combination of all the other types of affordances. So if an exit is easy to see, easy to understand, and easy to operate, it will also provide functional affordance. So it will be easy to achieve your goal of evacuation. So there's some examples that are really interesting to talk about as well. We may have egress components in a building that have poor affordances, for example. When we think about that sensory affordance, something that might have poor sensory affordance could be a door that's designed to be not obtrusive. And a classic example of this is if you go into an art gallery and you see there's a nice door, it's painted white like the wall behind it because they don't want the door to contrast with any of the art hanging there. So if you're familiar with the building and you work there, you know it's a door, you know it's an exit door. But if you're a guest and you're coming in to just visit town and look at the art gallery, you've got no idea what exits are there. So there may be a sign unobtrusively hidden toward the top of the ceiling on what looks like a wall and not a door. So if an alarm goes off, you're maybe not likely to take that door because you can't actually understand that it's a way out. It doesn't look like a door. So sometimes we may have some physical affordances. We may have some handles that are very difficult to use. So this could be some emergency doors or panic hardware that's very hard to push and it doesn't open properly or it's jammed or it's poorly rigged. We could also have, the classic is some of those doors that you may have seen them where they have like a glass door and it's got a handle on both sides and you go to grab it and pull it but it's actually a push handle. So we intuitively understand that there's a push plate you push on and a handle that you can grab. You kind of grasp it and pull it towards you often. There can also be some conflicts and affordances. So sometimes we may see something that really pops out at us but it's not in line with what the designer actually wants us to do. And some examples of these are exit doors that you might see when you're in a department store, for example, and they'll often have exits all the way around the store. But the exits that go through the back of house spaces or something like this, they're often marked with a big red warning label that says staff only or no admittance except an emergency or this door is alarmed warning. So even though it's an exit door, sometimes people can walk up to these doors and not intuitively understand that they're allowed to use them in an emergency. In my local department store, we have a door, and as you walk out of the entryway, it's got some yellow and black danger tape across it because they don't want people to walk straight out there. So in an emergency, is that tape going to still be there? Yes, it will because because no one's going to remember. So it steers people away from actually using it. Now, placing an exit sign in some weird place or putting a tape over your door doesn't seem like a huge fire hazard indeed. But when you realize that fire safety strategy is something that one person, a fire safety engineer, has designed for, and something that led to multiple, multiple choices done by that person in crafting the building systems crafting the escape routes it's all a part of one big ecosystem and it's quite dangerous that a simple design choice on how the thing will look in the end may actually alter the performance of the evacuation device that you are designing. It may seem trivial, but there are cases in which things like that have led to disasters. One of the tragic fires in which low affordance of the evacuation signage has certainly played a role in the scale of the tragedy is Daegu Metro Fire. To bring me up with that example, Professor Daniel Nielsen. So the Daegu Metro Fire happened on the 18th of February, 2003, around 10 o'clock in the morning. That was a really devastating fire. It killed almost 200 people and injured around 150 other people on the trains. It was an arson fire. So it was an arsonist who had two milk cartons filled with some type of flammable liquid. And as the train approached the station, he started fumbling with a lighter and was interrupted by passengers who were quite worried. They tried to stop him. And in that struggle, he dropped one carton and, well, the flammable liquid was spilled and it was ignited. And this was a really violently developing fire. It took about two minutes before the fire had spread to pretty much all the six cars of the train. One of the reasons for this was that you had the wall materials of the train were aluminum panels with combustible material between them. So once that started burning, then you got a really intense fire. And then also you had all the foam of the seats and interior lining materials burning as well. So it became a very, very violent fire. Now, one of the problems of this fire was that the train had stopped at a platform and another train came in around four minutes later and stopped on the opposite side of the platform. Initially, the doors of that train opened and then they were closed again since the station started filling up with smoke. Since at that point, when the train came in, there was quite a violent fire in the station. So the doors were closed again, and there was some uncertainty about what to do. And what happened was that, first of all, the fire took out the electric system in the station. So you had no electricity. You only had the battery backup of the trains. And then, unfortunately, the master key of the other train that had come into the platform was removed, which meant that all the systems of the train were shut off, which meant you couldn't open the doors. So at this point, you may think, what a terrible tragedy, but it's kind of an obvious one. An arsonist inside of a metro cart with a flammable liquid, with a combustible lining, another metro cart that arrives, power shutdown, a lot of things that went wrong. How did the fallacies play out in this tragedy, and why do we even bring that up? It's a story that was told at a recent fire conference by Professor Yuki Akizuki from Japan, who has shown how big role the signage had in the scale of the tragedy. Following on that, Professor Daniel Nielsen. So the only way of opening the doors was with the manual opening devices. Now, what Dr. Akizuki presented at the conference was an analysis of the signage relating to the emergency opening devices for the doors. And these signs were really, really small and placed at head height, but had the same color as the walls, basically, and really small font. So it became really difficult for people to see these signs. And this is linked to the sensory affordance, as we mentioned before. So it was incredibly difficult for people to see these signs. And if you can't see it, then you can't use it. As far as I've understood, it was also text instruction, which is in a stress situation could potentially be quite difficult to understand. So this was an issue with the sensory affordance mainly. Part of that is the small sign, the location of the sign, which made it difficult to spot. And the fact that it was the same color as the train walls, which also makes it, it doesn't stick out really. So it's difficult to see. There were also other sensory aspects that made it difficult. So in many trains in Asia, you have a lot of ads on the walls, and it becomes a very cluttered environment, which also makes it difficult to see these signs. They don't stand out. So here we have it, an emergency sign that was where it was supposed to be inside the train, guiding people on how to open the exits. But people were unable to process the information given by the sign, and as a consequence, they were not able to open the doors. And unfortunate final outcome of that is that so many people have perished in this tragic fire. It has, of course, led to an investigation which has unraveled the potential reasons which we have just discussed and led to a major change, major shift in how the signage is placed inside the metro cars of the Daegu Metro. But, of course, it's not just Daegu Metro where poor affordances of signage or other fire-related tools can be observed. Unfortunately, it's something not told to every fire engineer, and it's something that many of us would not think about. But this theory also allows us to craft good things. So perhaps let's switch the narrative and let's talk about what good ideas on evacuation signs and marking our evacuation pathways we can get by applying theory of affordances in practice. I've asked Professor Daniel Nielsen what makes a good evacuation sign. And my view would be something that you look at and you get the meaning of the sign without having any training. Now, that sounds simple, but it's actually quite hard to achieve. So the European exit sign is an example of this. Now for someone from Europe, particularly the old Swedish sign where you have the person running and an arrow and a box, for example, that was the old Swedish design. And if you are from Sweden and you've seen the sign plenty of times, then you know that it is an evacuation man running towards a door. But when I've shown this to people from other countries, it's not necessarily intuitive what the box is, that the box actually is a door that they're running towards. So ideally, it should be intuitive what a sign means, and some signs are better than others. Today, we have the man running through door sign. It's really hard in a podcast to explain what the sign looks like, but that's a bit easier to understand. But the idea when you design a sign is that it should be what we typically call intuitive, which would mean that you could easily understand it based on past knowledge that you had. And you should ideally understand it without being educated about the design or what the sign actually means. And the signs are not just on the doors. They would be also pointing the direction where you should evacuate or where you should like accumulate. Now, we have both exit signs that point towards the path, exit path. For example, if you're going to go straight ahead or if you're going to turn left or right. And then we have exits on top of the doors or sometimes on the side of the door that tells you that this is the emergency exit and this is where you should exit the building. I've also followed up on the color of the sign because the signs that I'm used to are green, but I've also seen in some parts of the world the red evacuation signs. So does color make the difference? In the U.S., from my understanding, they have both green and red signs, and you often find the green signs in museums. So as far as I've understood, you can have both colors of signs. And I guess it depends on your experiences. So if you are used to a red sign, then you will understand a red sign if you see it in buildings and that's part of your education and training. And if you're used to a green sign, you will understand that. It's interesting since the best color in smoke is actually the red color. So the red is what scatters the least in smoke, whereas green is sort of average and blue is the worst color you could use since it scatters really easily in fire smoke. So from an optical perspective, you should use red. But at the same time, there are some cognitive messages in the color red. For example, we use red to stop people. Green means go. So, for example, we've done experiments with different colors of flashing lights next to an exit sign, where a green exit sign with red flashing lights is often interpreted as stop, versus a green flashing light or green sign with green flashing lights next is perceived as come this way. So the color is definitely important for the interpretation of the sign. But again, we don't have any evidence that the red signs in the U.S. cause any major disasters. People are still using emergency exits. But that's also since they're used to the red signs. There have been a couple of studies on the impact of culture. So in some cultures, red has a negative, so it means stop, and it's danger, do not eat, in a North European or a European context. Whereas in other countries like China, red is the good color. There have been studies where we've looked at exit choice in virtual reality, so basically choosing left or right in a corridor system where we had red and green emergence exit signs and then did the experiments with people from Asian countries versus Sweden in this case. And we couldn't really see a difference in exit choice. And part of the reason for this is that the Chinese and Asian people who did the experiments, they were living in Sweden. So they had adjusted to the Swedish culture and green would be their preferred exit choice. So even though there is a cognitive interpretation or cognitive association to red, doesn't necessarily mean red is always the worst color or the best color. Now, applying this knowledge and the theory of affordances for a better design of evacuation pathways in signage is not necessarily straightforward. There are also some biases that engineers need to be aware of and caveats that you need to avoid. Yeah, it can be really, really tricky to find a design that works. Often you have an idea, but one of the problems is that as a fire engineer, you're a bit biased. So you're thinking fire and evacuation, and that's the filter that you apply when you look at your design. So the only thing you will see is an evacuation exit, a really clear evacuation exit, since you're thinking evacuation. Now, the people who are evacuating are not necessarily thinking the same thing. They might be thinking, yes, I need to evacuate since I have this siren blazing in the background, but I also have to get to my car if I'm in a shopping mall, or I have to pick up my kids at the daycare center at IKEA if I'm at IKEA. So they might have other goals and other things that they're trying to do. So they might have other goals that influence their behavior. So to use the theory of affordances, I would try and systematically analyze the exit in terms of what sensory, cognitive, physical, and functional affordances that it provides. And by doing a systematic analysis of these, you can see if there are any conflicts between affordances. And often when you have a conflict between affordances, that's when an exit isn't used. A common example in many buildings is when you have an exit with an emergency exit sign, but on the door, there is another sign that says an alarm will be triggered if door is open. That is an example of the conflict between cognitive affordances, where one sign is telling you, please use it in an emergency situation. And then the other sign is telling you, please don't use it since you will trigger an alarm. And that becomes the conflict between cognitive affordances. And when people are faced with this conflict, you get hesitation. So people think, well, it is an emergency exit, but at the same time, I'll trigger an alarm. I don't want to trigger an alarm. And then they might not use it. This example was also brought up by Luke Deschott previously. So we certainly have an agreement between our experts that the conflict in affordances can lead to complete overthrowing of something that could have been a very good and efficient emergency exit. Some of these things that were just highlighted, like a sign about the alarm being triggered if you open the door, many of those signs are added after the fire engineer is finished. So you might have a design, you specify the type of sign you should use and potentially where it's located in relation to the exit. But then during operation of the building, then you might add another sign that tells you that there is an alarm that will be triggered. And sometimes those signs pop up after someone, a customer, accidentally using the exit and getting into the storage space behind the emergency exit, and they don't want customers to go in there. So they add this sign on the door to avoid customers from using it in everyday situations. The problem is that that everyday solution will influence the use in an emergency situation, since you get this conflict between cognitive affordances. Now, this is a true challenge because it's where the fire safety engineering, something done at the design stage, something done when we plan out the building, when we make sure that the building is ready to take its occupants and fulfill its role, meets the real life, the needs and experience of the building user who may unintentionally really change the outcomes of our fire safety strategies. This must create a very difficult situation from a legal perspective when we try to investigate what led to disaster and by small alterations in fire safety design and knowingly one can create a big domino effect that can result in a fire with huge consequences. At this point, we've left the fire engineering realm, and we are talking about how to apply it. This is more an issue of communication and sharing the knowledge with the users of the buildings, explaining why we do fire safety engineering, what is the purpose of it, and what happens when it's wrong. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges the fire safety engineering is facing. Yeah, and one of the things that the theory of affordances does is it helps the designer to take the mindset of the user. And often as a designer, you're biased. You're designing an emergency exit, but the person using the building is not the designer. They don't think evacuation. They might be thinking of other things. So this theory helps you as a designer take the mindset of the user and understand how they would perceive the exit design. Probably the concrete way of using the theory. Understanding the needs of the user, understanding way how occupants will view our evacuation signage, doors, pathways, and the fire itself can surely be a way forward in designing the buildings of the future. We have one more tool that we can use that was already mentioned in this podcast a lot. That is the VR. And once again, talking about it, look at the shot. There's a lot of exit choice work in virtual reality. VR can be a really useful tool to understand how an egress strategy in a building or some sort of infrastructure can work before people spend a lot of time building it. So oftentimes we can work together with architects or designers and mock up a range of different possible layouts and signage layouts, for example, and put people in those scenarios and see how they will perform, if they'll actually use those features or not. And that is the end of our journey through the means of escape in this mini-season of the Uncovered Witness Fire Science Revelations. Over the course of three episodes, we've learned how do we take decisions Thank you. We've learned testimonies of tragic fires in which overcrowding was one of the issues that led to significant loss of life in the buildings. We've also learned that you cannot put a fire marshal in every building, but perhaps one day the building will be capable itself on enforcing the rules of how many people can be there and perhaps even guide us towards the safety in case of an emergency. We've learned about technologies that we install in our buildings today to make them safer. What do they affect and how can they improve our chances escaping to our safety? We've also learned that some technologies are not that simple or straightforward, and you need to include for the user experience or simply communication with the user to make sure that they are used as they are supposed to. In this episode, we've learned about theory of affordances and what makes a solution stand out and what makes it useless despite the fact it was present in the case of a fire. We've learned how people perceive the fire, perceive the signage, perceive the exits, and what conscious choices the engineers can make to improve that perception. We've also touched a bit challenging issue of what happens when someone unknowingly changes the evacuation signage and destroys our fire safety strategy. Indeed, this can have severe consequences for the building and the occupants themselves and all the parties, including the building administrator, Thank you. so far. Please send out your comments and ideas for future episodes. We are happy to discuss what has been presented. If it's been useful to you, please let us know. And if it's been useful to you, despite the fact you have had no previous experience with fire before, we will be thrilled. Please make sure to let us know. For this episode, I would like to thank my guests, Josh Gibbons, Luke Deschott, and Professor Daniel Nielsen of the Hallowell Fire Research. I would also like to give the final words of thank you to Hallowell Fire Research for sponsoring this podcast series and granting me access to all those brilliant fire experts I can talk to creating this content for you. See you in the next series about human behavior in fire.
