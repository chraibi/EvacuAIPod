 Hello everybody, I would love to say welcome to Fireside Show, but unfortunately due to combination of traveling, personal and technical issues, I'm unable to provide you with an episode of the podcast this week. But please do not worry, as I have a good proposal for you. You may have known or not, I have released another project. It was released more than a month ago, It's called The Uncovered Witness, and it also is a podcast. It has three episodes focused on means of escape. The project is a little different than the Fire Science Show, a little less conversational, a little less like an interview, more like a prepped educational material where we try to go deep into a specific subject. In this case, the things that make us be able to escape buildings. And yeah, three episodes are waiting there for you. I'm pretty sure there's a lot of listenership of the Fire Science Show who has not been able to check out that project. So hopefully my mishap today will provide you an opportunity to check the other podcasts and perhaps you'll like it actually. If you enjoy Fire Science Show, if you're a fan of this podcast, I am absolutely sure you will love Uncovered Witness. So yeah, for this week, I am very, very sorry that you will not get your Fire Science Show. But I promise for the next week, there will be an amazing episode waiting here for you. I'm working on it. I always wanted to do an episode on compartment fires. It's a little bit tough. But I'm getting there. And I hope it will be a great episode that you will all enjoy. Anyway, it's a long weekend in here in Poland. I hope perhaps in your parts of the world it's also a nice time for some short vacation. Enjoy. Wednesday and as usual I would love to express my gratitude towards the sponsor of the Fireside Show of our consultants who are continuously providing me with resources to produce the podcast for you and all the episodes that are planned to come in the upcoming weeks. Thank you very much and see you around.
