 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Due to the combination of live work and some personal stuff, I have posted something a little different than usual today, but I hope it's going to be interesting to you. Thanks to my podcasting career, I've met a lot of nice people who you could call as the Fire Podcasters. Yes, there is more of us in this world, and they also produce very interesting shows. Fire Code Tech, which you probably already know from the Fire Science Show, the Fire Sprinkler podcast, and there's a Smart Firefighting podcast by Kevin Sofen, which I'm going to highlight today. Kevin invited me for an episode of his podcast, which I am going to post just after this intro. It was episode 151 of Smart Firefighting Podcast, where we have talked about innovation and science and translating science into knowledge and how first responders can use this knowledge. For me, it was a very interesting discussion to be on the other side of the microphone and talk to Kevin answering his questions. Kevin graciously allowed me to repost this episode as a FireScienceShow episode. So I hope you do enjoy this, and if you do, you might want to give a try to Smart Firefighting Podcast, which is a very interesting project which connects innovators in the space of first responding fire response fire technology. Quite dynamic and filled with new technologies really. I really enjoy it. So this content is original content of Kevin and Smart Firefighting, but regardless, I would love to highlight that the whole Fire Science show is sponsored by OFR Consultants, who for a long time support me, and thanks to their support, I can continue this work. And by continuing this work, I get opportunities like this, being in someone else's podcast, which is very nice. So that's it for my short intro. Next week, we're back with a normal episode of the podcast. And for now, I give my air to Kevin and Smart Firefighting Podcast. Cheers. What's up, Smart Firefighting community? It's me, Kevin Sofen, and here at the Smart Firefighting podcast, we talk about all things technology and change management within public safety and first responders around the world. In today's pod, you're going to hear from Wojciech Borgandziski, sorry for butchering your last name, bro, who's an associate professor and a deputy head of fire research department at the Building Research Institute of Warsaw, Poland. For his professional career, and I'm sure in some of his free time, he sets stuff on fire and tries to model that with a computer, something that professionals would like to call fire safety engineering. E-Engineering. In this chat, we will talk about how the fire modeling can help influence evacuation procedures and also about how different training methods can be created based on this research. And also a really interesting take on the difference in thought between the building safety side, the prevention side of the house, and the first responder side, more the response side, and how this leads into conversations about the obstacles, but also opportunities that exist to create a better and safer world for everyone. Lots of fire and fun in this one. Enjoy. So Woj, how are you using fire science research to drive the future of fire safety for firefighters and the community at large? Oh man, that's a big one to start. Not very well, I guess. That's not a problem. That's an opportunity to improve for the future. So I think even though the fire science community is on a pretty good level academically, we have conferences, journals, papers, and everything, a lot of research going worldwide, I feel that the world of responders is like a parallel universe, you know. And I think that any issues you find in sharing knowledge and building a future, the challenges are not, you know, with better fire research or smarter fire responders or any updates on either side. It's about bridging them together. And that's the gap, man. That's the place where I think we could improve the most. So when you ask me how I'm translating my science to the realm where it can be used, first, I do science. I'm a professor. I do research. So I guess my end is covered in some ways by simply researching, using fundamental principles to uncover the rules that make or break fire safety, that define how fires will spread, behave, how you can extinguish them, when will they grow, what's the risks and hazards and stuff like that. But I also feel my role is much bigger than just researching that. And currently my mission is to build a bridge or multiple bridges between these universes and hopefully finally put that science into use. And this also means listening a lot. finally put that science into use. And this also means listening a lot. And that's the hard one, to exchange information and not evangelize. And I see, unfortunately, a lot of people, they would go and evangelize about the science. And that's not the thing. I need discussions. And that's why I'm here with you today. And that's why I love to hear from SmartFi Fighting community. What are their thoughts on how we can do this better? Yeah, well said. And I love the idea of how we translate science into action. And I think there is a big challenge and distinction between the building safety side, which is on kind of on the prevention, and then this first responder side, which is on response. Of course, there's community risk reduction, which has a big prevention side to it. But on this, you mentioned kind of these two different parallel paths when we're all actually on the same, I believe we all want the same goals. It could be wrong. But speak from a building safety side and, again, taking your knowledge and translating research into action. Like for those that maybe haven't thought too much on the building safety side and how codes were developed to get us where we are today and maybe the mismatch of where the codes are, where they need to go, give me some insights and knowledge around on that whole conversation. Yeah, man. Buildings are complicated beasts. Buildings are not something you would encounter 100 years ago. Now, I'm working in the Building Research Institute, you know, and I used to have this problem with some of my older professors in here who would put equilibrium sign between the building and the structure, and they would focus only on mechanical response of the structure, how loads are being transferred in the building, how stable and stiff it is, and stuff like that. And the more I was learning about fire safety, the more I hated this way of thinking, because structure is structure, building is a building. are a complicated array of systems, installations, and different elements in a puzzle that have to work together to provide what they are meant to. They are meant to provide shelter. They are meant to provide beauty in a way. They are meant to provide safety. Safety is what we obviously focus. So to really comprehend the building side, you first need to acknowledge or take the fact that buildings are really, really complicated. And it is even for professionals who spend their lives building buildings. I doubt many people would comprehend the whole aspect of what goes into the building from ventilation systems, from water supplies, electricity, all the aspects of heat transfer and energy efficiency of a building to very human things like how people use buildings, how people would adjust the building to what it is to fulfill their needs. And of course, the aspect of the fact that the building will change its way of use during its lifetime. Like buildings are created not for five years, they are created for thousands, if not hundreds of years. And it's very weird to assume that the building built today will function like this for the next hundred years. You know, something that today is a library, maybe a shopping mall or an office or a church or whatever. And you have no idea when will that happen. And you have no way to react today to the future needs. And that's what is happening a lot in the modern world. We're changing how buildings are used. So it's a complicated puzzle. And it is hard to expect, as I said, from professionals to comprehend the whole puzzle. But it's even harder to expect from responders to comprehend, especially that they are not wardens of a single building that they can learn through and through. But in their district, they may have thousands of buildings, each different, each living, each changing, each field with a different technology and systems and equipment and different strategies even. Yeah, it's a tough world for responders to navigate through these complexities of buildings. And me as working in this field of fire safety, fire science, and researching buildings, I certainly did appreciate a lot this vastness of solutions and possibilities and technologies involved in modern buildings. So I think to get this discussion going, we really need to focus on making our communications easier, maybe. Maybe that's the key. What do you think? Yeah, I mean, it's a combination of we all are using these buildings. I mean, we lived in, there's now more than half the world's population living in urban environments. And so we live in these built environments. That's at least just the way that our modern society is built out. Not a bad or a good thing. It just is the way it is. A good point you bring up is that buildings use change over time. And you sometimes see old banks turn into Walgreens. You see old stadiums, you know, either get torn down. I mean, or you see these, the Olympics and the World Cups where all this new infrastructure is just built and then it just dilapidates or turns into something else. And sort of what does that mean from a risk profile perspective? And what I like what you talked about too is just like a building, a good building is a functioning symphony of pieces that most humans walk in and we're just like, yeah, I walk in and put my coat over here. And, you know, I sit in a chair over here. Someone designed a hanger, right. To do that. And you may not appreciate that. Yeah. There's all these pieces that no one necessarily thinks about, you know, over my shoulder, there's a nice little retrofit hanger. But I think what I, I I'd love to kind of hear from you too, is that like with the buildings changing over time and how this is driving research and maybe both regulations, like big things that I could speak to in the past 20 years and ones more relevant or recent. One being the rise of the lightweight construction materials and how the stuff we put in it and stuff we build up buildings burns faster, burns hotter, and changing the response time. And that's been a huge methodology, brain shift for public safety, first responders. And then the other, and this is a, we could spend an hour just on this conversation, is the rise of lithium ion batteries. And of course, there's great benefits to them, but also huge risks to how we respond. And that's more stuff that's in the buildings. But you see people charging their scooters at home and how that leads to all these fires at home. So maybe those are kind of two conversations. But how has, like, the evolution of how we build stuff and the stuff that humans useiving maybe some of the research that you're doing and some of the testing that you're exploring. Fire science always has been something that responds to whatever's happening in the world. It has always been driven by fires, by disasters. And once something big burns down, it's us to step in and try to figure out a way why and how to prevent that. So it always has been responsive, even though we are trying to be more and more proactive in finding the weak spots. And I think at least in Europe, the Grenfell Tower tragedy was one of the wake-up calls that everyone actually quite seriously took. It's not okay to sit silent when you see an issue emerging. It's not okay to pretend that there's no issue when you see something is potentially dangerous. So we rather choose to step in and go public with our research and try to find solutions before the next great fire happens. So definitely disasters have been a huge driver of how we are doing our science. I'm also an engineer. I'm not just a scientist. I'm an engineer, fire safety engineer. And I used to be the car park guy. Then I've been the malls guy. And now I'm doing tunnels. And I guess I'm a tunnel guy now. I wonder whether I'm going to be in five years. A man of many hats. Yeah, and no hair. But as an engineer, I also, you know, do science to fill gaps which I need to design. Like, I understand that I do not have this particular number, you know, let it be design fire, let it be some kind of parameter of material that I'm using, let it be a design fire, let it be some kind of parameter of material that I'm using, let it be a specific way how a particular thing responds to high temperature. These are the things that I try to research and put in my research to receive this knowledge that I can employ in my everyday engineering. And that's the case, I bring it up because that's in a way a case of electric vehicles and battery fires. You mentioned that. I didn't consider that a big threat in buildings. Then there was maybe 2018 or something, there was this viral fire in Shanghai where a Tesla burned down in a mall, sorry, in a car park underneath some building. There was a video of this fire growing on off, you know, poof. And there's suddenly a huge fire in a car park. And I was like, oh, man, this does not look like my design fire in a car park. So being then a car park guy, I had one car park that I've been designing at that point. So I just stopped the CV simulations I was doing doing for the car park and i just restarted them but you know changing the the growth rate from like some value of alpha to like immediate growth to one megawatt to see like what would happen if if this magnet of course i had no idea what the numbers would be i just ballpark numbered them and my car park was not ready for that threat if i in my car park use a similar scenario, it would not be ready. It would not be good. And immediately we realized, okay, it's going to be years before we find the number of what the heat release rate of electric vehicle fire is. Because it takes years of research. But we can start trying to understand the consequences immediately. And that's what we immediately jumped into in 2018. And we've done a lot of numerical analysis, like 480 simulations, different configurations. And beyond any doubt for us, at least, we've proven that the height of the car park is critical. If your car parks are higher than three meters, then it makes very low difference between a quickly growing electrical vehicle fire scenario and the normal one, internal combustion engine. So we got this answer before we even know how big the fires are, because today we don't have, we still don't have a great design fire scenario for electric vehicles. for electric vehicles. So if you ask me how fire science can answer threats like that, well, by doing it immediately. Yeah. Well, interesting talking about the car parks and just this idea. We have these built environments, and then we put new stuff in it, and then we realize that maybe actually we're not prepared for these threats. And obviously, you know, the Grenfell Tower disaster is one thing, but then now kind of this rise of electrical cars, whether they're self-combusting or they're going into flames for different reasons. I know I heard, too, there are some car parks that have signs that say, you know, electrical cars, you know, not allowed. I've only seen some photos, Reddit of it I hadn't seen with my own eyes. But the way to maybe handle and deal as a car park owner or someone that's storing cars, one way to deal with it is just to try and avoid it. But then when you see here in North America, I know the president signed some bill that I think 50% of car manufacturers, the cars created by 2030 need to be EVs. So it's sort of like based on macro regulations, like there's no kind of, hey, EVs aren't going to be here. They're going to be part of our society. I think now it's a matter of how do we both build better moving forward and how do we retrofit what we already have to deal with these threats? I'm going to take this leap because, yeah, it's an interesting example of how all of the things must work together to create a safe world. You know, if we ban, that's the easiest thing. You can ban vehicles from entering a car park. But if you do that, did we win or did we lose? Like, what is the outcome and who benefits from a ban? Does the society really benefit? If you want to answer that question, you first need to find the probability of your fire, the consequences of your fire, calculate some unbiased metric like life quality index. And only through that very complicated and very long and very painful risk assessment with a metric in the end, you can tell if society did really benefit from banning the vehicles. And if you take into account the socioeconomic costs of banning these vehicles in car parks, the fact that you will have to use open land to store them because it's not that people will stop using vehicles because they're now banned in car parks. If you start really truly factoring all the numbers in some ultimate measure that is unbiased, you may actually find out that by banning them, we lost. Even though I have not done these calculations, I'm quite confident that banning is not an option. We need to find ways how to make it work. And to find how to make it work, you need multiple elements. First, you need to have civil engineers to understand how to build robust, resilient car parks, which goes back to what I've said about the height, for example. It's such a critical parameter. You cannot just cut it short because it will cost you a little bit more to dig a little deeper into the ground. If you do that, you cannot just cut it short because it will cost you a little bit more to dig a little deeper into the ground. If you do that, you change the risk profile of your building tremendously. Then you need smart designers of the safety systems in a building who can make systems that not only are fit for this one design fire that we have today, but that can handle threats from a large variety of possible fires in the car park. Also, some that we may not know even today, you know. Who knows, maybe in 10 years, we will all forget about electric vehicles and we're going to all drive hydrogen vehicles. You don't know that. I don't know that. Maybe. If I had a crystal ball. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Man, that would be nice, wouldn't it? Or I guess it would be boring. Then you need to recognize the fact that you have a building that allows your occupants to exit. You have a building that extracts the smoke produced in it. You have sprinklers that can limit the temperature, but you still have a burning vehicle in the car park. And there is a societal expectation that heroes wearing capes will run into the car park and will take it out or will put it down. And now, how do we make the battleground fit for the responders so they can take effective actions without being exposed to risk in a way that would be not too big for the action that they're doing. You know, we don't want to expose them to high risk when they're putting out a small electrical vehicle fire, because these fires can also be small but last for weeks. Next question is, do we really need to put them out? Is it maybe okay to just take them outside into a location where they can just burn off completely? When I'm doing battery tests, and this is a perspective of a laboratory, I hate when the batteries go down halfway the fire test. If they burn down completely, at least I know they are safe now. If they don't burn down completely, I have no idea what to do with them. And it takes us a lot of time for safety precautions to store them until they are safe. So to have us, to not ban, which is a simple decision, you need to have discussion with many, many bodies, including building officials, including designers, including system designers, including fire safety experts, and including responders. And from this giant discussion, which is a hell to get them all on one truck, because each of them will have different goals, perspectives, different backgrounds, different experiences. Only from that, a new way can emerge that is really safe. But, man, that's a really painful path to go, but a necessary one, but a hard one. Yeah. I mean, you touched on a lot there in terms of within this whole fire safety conversation. There's a matter of it's almost impossible to rule out the human element that something eventually somewhere will happen causing a need for an action. So some disaster is going to happen. Some fire is going to start. Someone's going to get hurt, something. So there's that kind of how to reduce the damage to the property. And obviously that's that one conversation. The second is, of course, how can we allow first responders to take effective action, which you mentioned. And the third that you touched on, too, that I'd love to dive into a little bit more is how to get people out safely. And a lot of this is dealing with the interaction with smoke and fire and escape routes. And I know you've had a lot of conversations with Reno, Guillermo, and just other people that are doing amazing work with fire science modeling and how that impacts sort of like evacuation routes and whatnot. Dive into that for a second, maybe some of the research and how you're using that for different structures, whether it's a manufacturing plant or whether it's a parking lot. And I preface this to looking at like when I see a 2D map of an escape route, like on the elevator elevator, I think, like, okay, like, I guess I'm here, and if something happens, I should run to those stairs. Like, is that preparing me? Don't know. So there's obviously a lot in that, but, you know, from someone that's doing research, and I'd love to know your thoughts on sort of the, you know, the evacuation modeling and how that turned into practice. Yeah, you know, years ago, there was this viral post on Reddit when someone asked, if you could tell people one important thing from your current work that they may not be aware of, what would you tell them? I'm a fire safety engineer. I am spending hours or days of my time, and people are spending thousands of dollars on modeling buildings and designing safety features. So you have one more minute to escape. Please don't waste it on taking a selfie with a fire and just follow the guidance. And that's still true, you know, many years later. We do a lot of sophisticated science and engineering to provide minutes, literally minutes. We're battling for minutes, not hours, not days. We're battling for minutes, sometimes even seconds of how long a route will be completely available to those in need for escape. long a route will be completely available to those in need for escape. This is a difficult job, you know, because in the end of systems of smoke control, of modeling the fire and smoke, we are fairly primitive related to humans. We just assume, okay, they will need between 60 seconds and three minutes to start moving, and then they will start moving at the velocity of 1.2 meters per second towards the nearest exit following the shortest path. That would be a typical assumption for, let's say, an office, you know. And I would use that very happily to estimate how much time I need to get those people to get out and then design my smoke systems, smoke control systems. So this is provided. On the other hand, if you start considering human behavior, now, the deeper you go into that, the more interesting it becomes because suddenly you have the whole decision process. because suddenly you have the whole decision process. Suddenly you have dynamics of groups of people where they will act different than a single person. You have different personal preferences, different experiences of every single person in the building. You will have leaders emerging in that that will be followed. Or if a leader does not emerge, no one will follow anyone. They will wait for first action to be taken. So for, because we need to engineer, like we cannot say, okay, I'm unable to engineer your building because I don't understand human behavior in fire. I cannot do that. They will just find another engineer who will happily do that, being maybe a little more comfortably diving into unknown. But I need to work with something. So our assumptions are not bad, I think, for a start. But to say we truly solve the human-fire interaction in the buildings, making sure it's 100% safe. No, we don't do that. We do the second best thing. We estimate how long you would need to escape, how long time we would need to take to escape the building to safety. And we give you the time. And that's the time you have. In fire, of course, it will be different. We choose a scenario, we choose some assumptions. Every fire is different. But yeah, that's what we're currently doing. And interested in that and how I love looking at the crossover from fire safety engineers to first responders to other entrepreneurs and how this is all kind of interconnected to ultimately providing a safe and equitable society for everyone. But when thinking about, let's say, for example, of a fire in a building or in needing to figure out what's the best way to get people out. And you talked about finding we're not looking for hours, we're looking for seconds and minutes of time to give you time to do that. I've seen and personally been in situations where I know when the disaster happens, your fight or flight mode gets into action. You all of a sudden are like, you are tunnel focused and your heart rate's up and you kind of just go to this instinctual caveman mode. And what are your thoughts in terms of like how you train people? And what are your thoughts in terms of like how you train people? I mean, training first responders, their conversation, but I'm thinking of workers or civilians that go to, especially in like sporting events where they're, they maybe only go to this place like once or twice a year. What are your thoughts on how the research translates into preparedness of people? And are those 2D signs that you see, are those enough? Or like anything you're seeing that maybe is intriguing you in regards to that kind of conversation? That's a difficult world. That's a difficult thing to do to train population. Because it's fire stuff. Fire doesn't happen. They don't happen to me. They will eventually maybe happen to my neighbor, which I'm pretty fine with, but not to me, right? And I've never had a fire happen to me. So why should I spend hours training to how to respond to a fire? It's difficult to build a mindset of training people. Now, when we are designing spaces, when I'm designing a sports arena, I would design it in a way that I can really empty the whole thing twice before the fire becomes a danger. It's a completely different level of design going into that type of structure because there will be large crowds. The hazards are on a completely different level. So even untrained population in a very well-prepared and designed space, there are spaces which we literally designed for infinity. Like the fire never reaches levels at which it's threatening to the population. So if you're in such a space, you don't really need that much training. However, the most dangerous place is your home. You're probably most likely to die at your home, more likely to die at home than at sports arena, especially from fire. I think a lot must go into training people how to react to fires that happen in their everyday setting setting at your office, at your home, what to do when you're sleeping and there's a fire in your kitchen, why you should not store your electric scooter at your only path between where you are and your exit, you know. So if you think about the societal benefit of how do we provide the most safety and the most cost-efficient way, training people how to deal with this simplest threats in their everyday environment is probably the best. And for that, you don't need fancy modeling. For that, you don't need super exquisite three-dimensional science that will illuminate the pathway in front of a person. For that, you need simple education and finding ways to really reach the population mindset. And I think there are organizations who are doing a really great job at showcasing the basic threats, teaching people about the most important hazards in their own environments. UL is doing fantastic. FSRI is doing a fantastic job on that. Then next step is your work place, offices, car parks. And here is an interesting, because these places, because they're fairly small, small corridors, small compartments, this tend to be more difficult to provide tenable conditions for a very long time because of space. If you have a lot of space, if you have open space, you have a lot of place to hold the smoke in, in a way that it doesn't threaten people. If you have a two and a half meter tall corridor, which I have absolutely no idea how much feet is that, but I guess a lot, it should kill O'Neill in a bit. And if you have such a corridor, there's not much space to keep the smoke away from people. It will eventually reach them. So in these spaces, I think technical innovation and solutions, one, in space of bringing information to the people, dynamic signage, maybe smart evacuation maps, voice alarms, you know, all these things that can guide people to safety with high credibility and maybe even distinguishing between individual people in the population. Like if there was a system that could track every human in the building and have a plan for each person, how to get them to safety and just guide them through the building as they are evacuating. That would be the pinnacle of this. And I believe this is possible. We could already achieve this with current technology. Maybe we just need a little more innovation in this space. And one last thing that I wanted to bring, if you're talking about innovation, I think we entered an extremely interesting space in terms of training with augmented and virtual reality settings where you can literally map someone's office and simulate real fires in them and have them in a very deep, immersive environment to escape from those. I believe these things are brilliant because you cannot teach experience. You have to experience experience and experiencing something in vr may be the second best thing to the real world so i'm a huge believer in these developments and i believe in a space where really tech and innovation can change something i think this level is where these types of technologies can work because at home realistically you're not going to overinvest. Like, if you had money, you should have put sprinkles in your house. That's the number one thing. And you're not going to invest in dynamic signage for your home. For sports arenas and skyscrapers and railway stations, airports, there has been a lot of investments already. And if a system exists that makes a difference, it's already there, at least from my experience. But there's this ton of middle space in medium-sized buildings where I guess that's a good space to innovate and bring safety to people. I love your phrase on you can't train experience, you need to experience experience. to these people. And I loved your phrase on you can't train experience, you need to experience experience. And that's definitely an advantage of VR. But I think there's also a lot of evolving ways to use some of these new models we have, and turn it into content that can be trained on even in 2D settings, to be able to consume content, really meet people where they're at. And I think that's what excites me about technology in a all the ways is removing barriers to access to education, access to information. And I think, and I actually haven't even said this on the podcast, but it's great to have a fellow podcaster on my podcast. If you haven't heard of the Fire Science Show, you need to tune in and we'll put the links in there. But I'm kind of, from your experience, podcasting. in your experience, I mean, you're a man of, you wear many hats, being an engineer, researcher, father, podcaster, all these things. I'm interested in, from kind of the podcasting side or maybe in general, like, what's something that you've learned in the past couple of years from someone else that's like, that either is like really made you sit up straighter in your chair or, you know, whether out of excitement or fear, as far as any sort of trends with things happening or some new technology that you see that could be applied, but it's not being applied well enough. And I know we talked about EVs, so we could speak on that more. But, you know, what else is on top of the mind for you that you've learned from your work? If you want a really brutal and honest answer, I have been thinking about this a lot. And I was preparing for a one-year anniversary of Fire Science Show. I've done like 15 interviews with brilliant people, brilliant minds of fire science. Really the best I could find on various topics, you know, from combustion to evacuation to modelers, firefighters, people who research, people who apply, amazing group of people. And I was contemplating, like, what are we lacking? And it was not research that we were lacking. It was not innovation that we were lacking. It was not innovation that we were lacking. There were so many good ideas. You know, we literally had a solution for anything that comes, really. Like, even the toughest problems, EVs, it's figureoutable. We can figure it out. What I've reflected over doing that podcast is we really lack communication. Like, we have fire science. It just doesn't reach people it needs to reach. And it goes both ways. As I said in the beginning of the episode, communication is not only talking, it's also listening. And I have too many, I know too many people in the realm of fire science science that are blind to the needs of responders, that are blind to needs of the construction engineering world community. Because if I propose you the new super funky gadget that solves all the problems of the world in terms of fire, but it's so expensive that no one will build it into the building. And it's so annoying to first responders that the first thing they will do when they arrive is to turn the gadget off. And the gadget is not very useful after all, even that if in my perfect simulation, it solves the problems. And boy, we have a lot of these gadgets that are put into use without giving a serious thought on how all stakeholders will use a benefit from. So, yeah, man, the answer is really simple. We need to talk more. We need to, but really talk, not just communicate, not just give a presentation on a topic, high five, and go back to what we're doing. We really need to talk and understand needs of other people, and we need to do this research together, and only that way we can achieve something that we could call a fire-safe world. Fire science will not do that alone. Like, we're a bunch of clever people who like to play with fruit numbers and, you know, very complex concepts of combustion and stuff like that. That's pretty cool. But you also need to understand how does a firefighter approach a fire. And you also need to understand how investor building a building makes their decisions on which technology to put in their building and which not. If you're blind to that, you're doing science for science, which is not a great science after all. And that's also, you know, to build this bridge, to build this communication, to cover this communication gap. That was one of the reasons I started my podcast interviewing fire scientists, giving them another way to communicate. And, you know, I'm the ears and mouth of the community, and I try to ask them the important questions that come from the experience of people behind me, the ones who I represent. And you, as the spokesperson of the smart firefighting community, you're doing the same great and important job. And I wish there were many more shows like this that bring people together in a setting that promotes real conversation. Yeah, well said. And I don't want to have conversations to check a box or for any sort of personal vanity. I couldn't agree more that we have all the technology and we have all the insights we need, but it's part change management, but it's really, it's different stakeholders. And whether that's the mayor and the fire chief and the firefighter to the general John Doe and the community to the principal of the school, to the risk manager of a manufacturing plant. And one approach that we're taking, too, is doing more of these roundtables. This is great. We're hosting a conversation offline. Me and you will post in a couple weeks in order to chop it up and do some good content. But one thing that I've really moved towards, and I also, I'm an adjunct professor at DePaul University, teaching a class around developing sustainable strategies. And I remember thinking, feeling major imposter syndrome. I was like, how did I get this job? Like, why am I qualified for this? But what I loved when I was in formal education myself was learning from my peers. And I think it's so important to facilitate two-way conversations. Like you say, it's asking questions, talking, and most importantly, listening. And so I think this creating two-way streets amongst the disparate stakeholders, I would retweet your comment and say that is correct. You know, that to me is the biggest gap that exists, and hence I think the need for our continued communication within this realm and i think it's a my it's an ask everyone listening about you know keep submitting ideas for what you want to hear about keep supporting podcasts like this and and woj's podcast and just there's but it can't just be to check a box sake i mean we we need to continue to turn the research and the science these conversations into action to ultimately, like what you said, create a fire-safe world. I really like that term. And I don't think I've actually heard that term. And I guess to focus on that for a second, like in your context, like what is a fire-safe world? And, you know, what's a fire-safe world in your words? I'm a huge believer in risk engineering. What's a fire safe world in your words? I'm a huge believer in risk engineering. And because I find risk truly the only unbiased, non-emotional way talking about fire, I've learned that when I've entered the tunneling space. Because in tunnels, you literally cannot design a tunnel in which in every single scenario you go through, no one will have harm. It's simply impossible. Like the consequences of some events are so catastrophically, there's not a piece of technology that could prevent them. And then you learn that these events are so rare that maybe it is not worth it to invest to prevent against them because they are so rare. That's a concept of how you do risk engineering. Of course, it's more advanced than that. And of course, I have podcast episodes about that. But essentially, you would love, you learn really what you deal in your building with and what are the consequences of thereof. and what are the consequences of thereof. And for me, a fire-safe world is one in which we've done everything that was reasonable to improve our outcomes of fires. It is not a world in which you do not have a fire. We always will have fire in our world. It's a force of nature, you know. It's like wind and water. We always will have fire in our world. It's a force of nature, you know, it's like wind and water. We always will have fire. It's about managing these risks in a way that leads to minimized risk profile that is economically justifiable, that is acceptable by the society at the level where you know that you really could not invest more in fire safety to improve it. It's a difficult concept, you know, and of course, if I ever am, I hope I'm not, but if I ever end up in a fire, I'm not going to calculate the risk profiles to give myself comfort that I am in huge danger, but it's low probability, so I should be happy with it. Of course, that's a philosophical thing, your personal risk versus societal risk. But I believe that this is the true, maybe not true, that's the most unbiased method we can measure it. And I will say something that's maybe difficult to many people. Like in not every building, in not every setting, a fire is the worst thing that can happen, you know. It's also not about over-investing in fire at the cost of other things. Fire safety already costs a lot. And sometimes it costs so much, people would do very stupid things to just not have the costs done. And the problem, the further you go from the Western world, the more issues with that you'll have. Fire safety is a cost. Sometimes it's more cost-effective to build a hospital than cover every tunnel you have with a fireproof lining. And we are living in a world that has limited resources, and I would love to know that these resources are spent in a reasonable way. And overspending on fire safety just because you would like this one more fancy gadget is, I don't think that's the way, you know. I also had some hard conversations, you know, I'm talking with all these fire safety experts and people who are designing, let's say, skyscrapers. Skyscrapers are extremely fire safe environments. And we're talking about technology that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and they will give one thousandth of a person a chance that your outcomes are better in fire. And at the same time, there's 1 billion people without access to running water, you know. And when you start looking at that from that perspective, it sometimes feel like we're spending an adequate amount of resources and efforts on things that do not really matter. So a fire safe world is a place where we spend our resources on places that matter and we try to achieve most bang of our buck protecting people from harm in fires. That's the one that I would like to live in. Well said. And you had a lot in there that resonated with me and especially with aspects of our community on both the entrepreneurial startup side and fire chief. But kind of one of the final questions I want to ask you today is, what is something that you would say to entrepreneurs or startups that are trying to innovate in this space? Of course, there's a lot of differences between the tech you would create from a hardware software side and prevention and response side, but still your last message of utilizing your resources most effectively to deliver outcomes that are better for society as a whole, I think is a great overarching message. But what would you tell an entrepreneur that's trying to do good and is still kind of early on in the process of figuring out their niche within this whole fire safe world? this whole fire safe world. Yeah, that would be to ask yourself why and ask it many times. Why this product is being invented? What purpose does it serve? What problem does it solve? I know that from my fire scientist career pathway, I used to be very bad at that. I thought, okay, the problem is we don't extract smoke soon enough. So let's innovate in the space of sensors where I will invent something that will detect fire five seconds earlier. Well, the real reason, where the real problem on the building is not how quick the sensor is, but the guy who will turn the sensor off because it annoyed him, you know. how quick the sensor is, but the guy who will turn the sensor off because it annoyed him, you know. And we really need good identification of real problems that are truly holding us back and not to innovate in some virtual space, in a place where this innovation, okay, it sounds cool on a paper, you know, you have 5% more than your competition on XYZ parameter. But does it really change the fire safety landscape of a building? Does it really help the building owner, the building occupant, the first responder? In what way? Is it simpler to implement? Is it easier to maintain? Is it more robust? Does it provide more resiliency to the building? Does it open new opportunities for the firefighters to battle on the scene? These are important questions, not how quick my sensor will detect or whatever fancy thing I'm going to provide now. We don't need gadgets. We need solutions. And there are brilliant people innovating in this space. Once you start asking yourself these important questions, what is the problem on every level of a building? Who does this problem affect? And what would be the most efficient solution to solve that problem? You may have the next big innovation in the fire space. Because think about, like, what were the biggest innovations in the fire space? Sprintlers. They were innovated because you needed a firefighter really quickly in the place. So why not just build it into the building, you know? How did we get automatic smoke detectors? Like, there was a button that you need to press to call the firefighters. And then suddenly you had a building that called the fire department on its own. How brilliant is that? You see, there's a need and there's a solution. There is many problems now in the ways how buildings are being built. We need to build buildings faster. We need to build them in a more sustainable way. We are thinking, We need to build them in a more sustainable way. We are thinking, I think a huge space to innovate is within the circular economy and all the concepts that buildings are designed with their change in life or how to dismantle them and rebuild them elsewhere. Have you ever heard about the fire system that you can build into a building and then take it out of the building and use it in another building i have not because they're always one use uh systems if you build your your system into building usually it's impossible to to adjust with that adapt that you can only tear it out and and put a new one that's not the most sustainable thing you can do so i see huge potential to innovate because here I identify the problem. We do not have a way to reuse. And I try to act on that problem. And if you truly innovate in this space, I think you're going to achieve great success. If you innovate in a space where you just want, when you just deliver a product like everyone else, and you just want to have this one single characteristic that outperforms your competitors, you may focus too much on that characteristic and lose something else that happened multiple times. Or there will just come someone who will show that this characteristic may be not the most representative for the use, and you're left with nothing. I'm not an innovator. I'm surely not a manufacturer. You're a piece of the puzzle and I really appreciate all that context and I think, I mean, we're almost creeping up on an hour and I think it's easy to say we're due for another pod. I feel like I almost, we're really scratching the surface. You know it's a good pod and all of a sudden I'm like, oh, geez, I have to run to something else here. But I think one kind of final sort of question I always ask people on the show is if you could leave us with like a kind of final question or quote or a challenge or it's kind of like a mic drop, you could say. But if there's something that's burning in your brain or kind of something you live by, I'd love kind of any sort of final thoughts to wrap up our conversation here today. Now, that's a challenge because we've covered so much in this podcast episode. And if you want another one, I have a good mic and I'm always here. So just give me a call. You should think about building as a living organism with many organs, with many functions, with many goals that everyone in the process sees in a different way. Think about your next building or your next project. How would the user see it? How would the user see it? How would the owner see it? How would the construction company who's building it see it? How would the first responder see it? How would the government see it? Or how would the people who are responsible for dismantling it at the end use it? How would people who would like to change it to something completely else see it? Try to put as many perspectives on your building and try to identify as many questions and challenges for that building that are related to a specific fire hazard, let's say, or something. Because through that exercise, you will start building this holistic understanding of the building. And you might suddenly realize that a simple solution from one stakeholder's perspective is a catastrophe from another's one perspective. And once you start seeing buildings like this, it's like in a matrix. You suddenly start to feel it and the things that you start to propose are things that solve the most people's problems and that these are good solutions. So if you need exercise, try to think about building. And there's a word I hated holistically. So think holistically about buildings, but in reality, just put a different pair of eyes looking at the building from different perspectives. So you're not blind to the needs of other stakeholders because they're all important. And if we don't talk, you don't know. And, yeah, you don't deliver safety in a reasonable way. Man, well, Woj, from one podcast to another, thank you for what you're doing, the awareness, the education, breaking the gap, and especially as what you're doing from a fire science engineer and researcher. It's all super important. I'm really glad to have captured your perspective today. And frankly, I know this is only the first of many for our conversations. And just thank you for all you're doing. And I look forward to chatting again soon. Thanks, Kevin. Thank you for the invitation. Looking forward to your discussion panels. I love this format and we need more of that. So thanks for pioneering this innovation in the space of communication, man, innovating in communication. I should put that in there. Yeah, I should put that in my LinkedIn handle. Write it down. Write it down. Cheers, man. Cheers, Bush. Thank you so much for listening to the Smart Firefighting Podcast today.
