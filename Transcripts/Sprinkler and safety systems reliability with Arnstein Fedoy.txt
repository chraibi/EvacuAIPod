 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 41, great to have you here. If you recall, some time ago I was at the IWMA conference in Warsaw, where I've met some nice people, and among them was Arnstein Fidoj, who talked with me about the reliability of sprinklers, and then I told you that this has to be a full episode, because the subject was so interesting, And here it is. I finally got Arnstein on the podcast and spent a good while discussing the concepts of reliability of sprinkler systems with him. And not only reliability of sprinkler systems, reliability as a concept in general, the ways how we gather data, the ways how we process data, and the ways how reliability is relevant to the engineering that we are doing. I don't think this needs much more introduction because the episode tells you everything. And if you listen to that IWMA episode, I'm absolutely sure you're going to enjoy this one as much. And if you haven't, well, it's there. You can try it. this one as much and if you haven't well it's there you can try it and one more thing before we start as you probably see around the the situation in the world is not really nice at the moment in the country next to poland there are bombs falling on cities and people are getting killed for reasons i do not really understand as a polish society we are trying to help a lot to the people escaping from Ukraine. And as ITB and me and with my family, we're also trying to help. We're going to host some Ukrainian refugees. For the scientists in the field of construction and engineering, we're trying to get them jobs in ITB so they have a safe haven where they can stay for as long as they need. And if you'd like to support this effort, you can always support the podcast and everything that will go into here. We're going to fast forward to the people in more need. So if you would like that, there's a buy me coffee button that you can use. And now let's go back to the reliability. Let's spin the intro and let's jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the FireSense show. I'm today with a guest who's made a small appearance in the show, Arslan Fidoj, the CEO of Ingus AS. Hello, Arslan, great to have you back here for a full episode this time. Thank you. And I really appreciate that you take the time to talk to me. It's a really good time. So great to have you here. We're going to talk reliability. I mean, it's a topic that you've made sound exciting to me when I first heard your presentation in Warsaw. And I thought, wow, yeah, this is a subject that is touching not only the fire sprinkler people, if I could call them that, but it's touching the whole of fire safety and maybe even beyond, because we so often take decisions based on the assumption that sprinklers are there to save us. In so many codes, and Polish one included, you have so many regulations that allow you to omit something, to change the fire resistance of your building, to change the compartmentation of your building, to even change the whole strategy on how you protect the building just based on the fact that sprinklers exist. And it's a system, and systems are not built equal equal and reliability is an important part of that. So let's start with the big word, reliability. I love to ask people in this podcast, not about the definition, but what it is to you, how you understand it, because this often goes beyond the definition terms. Well, if you asked me some years ago, I would probably say that something works so as predicted. If I think about my car, I think that it should start and it should stop at the point and between that it should work as predicted. But now I am a little bit more confused. I'm also a little bit clearer on that. But for me, when it comes to reliability, you have to put it up to something that's measurable. For instance, if you have a sprinkler standard, you can measure it up to that. Does it work as intended to a sprinkler standard? Does it control a fire between this hazard glass, it's designed for. So for me, the design and standards have been very important because it is something I can measure up to. And that's one of the problems that we face a lot of times. We have a lot of ideas about things. But when it comes to make it measurable, what we also could call operationals, that's hard. Because you have to think and you have to try out what actually works. So it's not an easy task. But for me, this is very important to tell. Because I talk about sprinkler reliability. And it's not a surprise for listeners who heard me last time that my work has revealed that we actually don't know so much about sprinkler reliability. My start into the fire science engineering came because I loved the idea that was presented in the discovery program in the late 1990s, beginning of 2000, called Iblis. In that program, we went to Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona, one of the first cities in the United States that implemented that every building should have sprinkler systems. I had tremendous success with that. And Jim Ford, that was the fire chief at that time, talked about what they did. And I realized, oh, genius, having a firefighter in your house 24-7. Genius. I love the idea. But afterwards, when we started to work with this, it started to pop up different numbers in reliability. And when I started to look into it, I found out if I went to Australia, New Zealand, we talked about reliability. It was close to 100%. But if we went to the United States and NFB, we find approximately 95. But then I started, FM also has numbers for 88. Where does these numbers come from? And that's the main goal for my master thesis, to try to look into why did these different numbers come up. Because in the beginning, I thought, well, for instance, there's different regulations in different countries. So perhaps if a country had more interest in maintenance than other countries, that would probably have something to do about reliability. other countries, that would probably have something to do about reliability. So if I just could figure out the dots, I could say something about it, and we could take all the surveys in the world and separate it on different issues, and you have some sort of index that you as a country, if you didn't have a survey, could go in, okay, we are good in that, we're not as good as that, and you can come up with a number for your country. That was my main idea. But sadly, this was not the case. So when I started to look into each service and find out that they actually didn't look at what they told us in the beginning, they were looking at us, that was a big surprise. When you talk about numbers and percentages, like 88%, that already sounds great. You know, 95%, that's amazing. 100%, that's fantastic. But if you think about it deeply, the difference between 88% and, let's say, 90%, that's two failures for 100 and 12 failures for 100. That's six times difference. So it's not a difference of few percent. It's a difference of a whole scale. As I told you in the pre-show, I'm not really that interested in Sprintless themselves. I appreciate the technology. I'm a benefactor of the technology, but it's not my field of research. But within my field of research, which I would position somewhere around compartment fire dynamics or structural fire engineering in an interface between the two of them, the presence of sprinklers is often considered as one of the most important variables in the equation. If sprinklers exist, we assume they completely change the course of the fire, which they do, if they work. Sometimes, sometimes. And that's one of the big surprises for me, because, for instance, you have residential sprinklers. And they work different according to which system we are talking about. Are we talking about a system where maximum two sprinklers activated or they were forehead with twice a month of water? They work totally different. The first system is prolonging the time you have to escape from a residential fire. resident in fire. But after 10 minutes, you cannot tell with any scientific background that it actually will do much more than that. After what's 10 minutes, you probably will be safe, you probably will go out, and perhaps even the fire would be put out. But there's absolutely no guarantee for it. But if you have a different system, like for storage, ESFR, that's the only system in the sprinkler world that's actually an extinguishing system. If it doesn't extinguish the fire, it doesn't work. That's the reason why if only one sprinkler head is an obstacle to develop the water, the whole system fails. Because we thought that perhaps we had residentials at the bottom, and we had ESFR as extinguishers on top. Perhaps that is not correct. Perhaps it's different. Perhaps ESFR is between residentials and ordinary controlling system. Because if you have to have control, is that the main object? Then you also could have the possibility to extinguish. But it's the only thing you achieve. Yeah. So there is a lot of confusion when it comes to reliability, what the sprinkler system can do, what the different systems can do. And when you go to the literature from NFPA, FM and so on, they treat them at the same. Maybe even put three categories in it, like the reliability of the machinery itself, the reliability of operator and the person responsible to maintain, and the capability of the system to actually deliver what it is supposed to. And even perhaps in more areas. But the main thing, the main focus is that we have to start somewhere now, because we have a lot of data on sprinklers. We have to start treating them as valuable as it is and start to ask really good questions. Does it measure what the things we wanted to measure? Yeah. So how do we measure it? Give me the brutal truth of how it is done today, or... How it's done today? That's done in a variety of ways. We have some systems that just check out, does it be in the fire here? Yes. Has it been a sprinkler system here? Yes. Did this system put out a fire? Yes and no. And that's it. Like a survey after a fire. Yeah. And that's very interesting because that's the fact we actually are looking for. But if you don't ask what kind of system was in this building, it wouldn't give us any answers. You cannot compare a motorized bicycle with a Formula One car. Both these vehicles, yes, but this is completely different vehicles. And we have to start talking about what kind of vehicles are we talking about. And the big surprise, the really, really big surprise, and this should shock all the engineering community, is that when it comes to doing surveys in a scientific way, we suck. Yeah, I know. And that's a bit of truth. I think my book is the second one that actually in the whole engineering area that's talking about how to do correct surveys. And why is this? I thought I was going to stand on the shoulders of giants ahead so I could just pick and choose. But suddenly I start to wonder, where are they? I start to wonder, where are they? We have actually not developed a method for how to do survey, and even to do the opposite, go back again and say, what should we do actually for having this kind of reliability for our building when we're talking about fire science? Because even if we can really criticize the sprinkler industry for doing the things that they've done, they've actually tried. But if you're looking to fire detection systems, if you're looking to passive systems, well, there is not much number there. And that brings the big problem for me and you right in your lap, how are you certain that your house, your building is done in a correct manner? I really wonder, is the idea correct and is it fundamental? Because it seems we're trying to measure reliability by capturing all of the outcomes from all of the world, like you gather the reports from all of the fires, whereas like in medicine and after COVID, every one of us is an expert in virusology and we know everything about clinic and tests now, right? So you take a sample of people, like you take a thousand of people or 5,000 of people, you subject them to a test and then you get an outcome. So why don't we do it like here, get 5,000 representative systems and just monitor them over a decade and just base reliability on that? Yeah, the same thing struck me because when I have to develop the method for trying to figure out what's going on here, I have to look into medicine. I have to look into social sciences to see how do they conduct service because there was absolutely none literature whatsoever into our world. But the people that work with science and medicines, as you mentioned here, they know very well how to do survey. And they are even having much more complicated issues to baffle with because we are trying to find out numbers. They also talk about people that's trying to describe something with words. We're actually trying to find out, did that work? Yes or no? Zero or one? That's the whole idea for us. But when you look to medicine, they have a much more harder time to find correct data because they have to ask the patient, how do you feel after this treatment? And it's much harder to put numbers to that. I wonder, so do you see a way forward to have a validated reliability, like a truly measured one, one that we can rely on? Very good question. That depends completely on what different people and different organizations decide. Because I know for a fact that somebody is a little bit upset by my work, because they think that this has been quite harsh or hard or whatever to conclude as I had done. But it is the bigger sensations to have the data today that also have the possibility to change how are we collecting it, how are we analyzing it, and how do we validate the information we had. Or there has to be a change in the different government around the world that say, okay, in Norway, in Poland, we actually start to measure this because we realize now that this is important. And we start from scratch. Very good. It's very easy to start from scratch because everything you do will be better than it was the last day. So it depends on completely what is the main focus for the authorities. Okay, so philosophical concept of reliability aside, let's talk about Sprinklr systems. let's talk about sprinkler systems if I hear a number that 95% of time it worked, like what is what are the constituents of that number hidden inside? What information does it bring to me as a non-sprinkler engineer? Like I'm a structural engineer, I want to know can I lower the fire resistance of my compartment because I have the sprinklers and I receive a number, 95%. Does it mean 95% of the time I'm going to be safe? No, it doesn't, because we have to separate between life, material, and environment. Okay. At least, perhaps even more. But let's take just a little bit about life. There is an overwhelming material that suggests that with the sprinkler systems, the life safety goes up to the roof. It really, really helps because in the first critical minutes of a fire, it really will dampen it down and give you the time to escape. It took a long time, for instance, and I mentioned Scottsdale, it took a really long time before they had the first fatality in the fire where it was a sprinkler building. When it comes to life safety, I think that the numbers we are talking about that is really high. But the second one is the material aspect. And that's rather confusing because it also has to be somewhere connected to the environment. What is our suspicion? What do we want from this building? Do we really expect it or allow it, is perhaps a better word, allow the building to even burn down? Would that be a possible outcome that's good for everybody? not sure about that more because even in your EU regulations about environment what does that say about the suspendability in the future is we are going to allow buildings to burn up so there is a lot of areas where we don't actually have the numbers or the goals we can measure our fire engineering up to. We only have codes, regulations. And I'm not sure if that's the correct way to measure it. If we wanted to increase reliability, because I know you were looking in depth in the statistics to what could have been found in the literature. to what could have been found in the literature. There's areas emerge where it's obvious that the reliability is low and others where it's, let's say, universally high. I don't know how to frame it, but my hunch would give me that a human would be a weak link and whenever you turn off sprinklers for maintenance or for something, you have the possibility of forgetting to turn it off on. So I guess that would be the weakest link that no technology can probably fix. But looking into the numbers beyond the numbers, have you found these areas? Because I think this could be also a critical knowledge when we are considering the issues like you've mentioned. If there are different targets for our reliability that we would like to achieve, we need to understand the actions that can actually improve that outcome. One of the things that's really, really interesting is that when it comes to mechanical systems, and sprinkler systems are mechanical systems, system and sprinkler system is a mechanical systems it heavily and over time relies more and more about maintenance and the testing that has to happen regularly because systems as a mechanical it designs not to stand still it's designed to actually work. It's designed to work within the fire. The pump is designed to run. And if the pump doesn't run, and the even base, it starts to rust, it starts to put things into the system that shouldn't be there, and they have damage to it, and so on and so on. So we have to actually, in the future, have much more emphasis on how to do the testing and the maintenance. And gladly, we are living in a time when there is systems on the way that are going to automatically do this and even put artificial intelligence into it to read and give data on it. And we are just in the starting group now for how to look into that in the future. But before we actually can say how much that does affect the system, we have to start to measure what is the reliability when it is in place. And as I mentioned to you earlier, in Norway, for instance, we have a big industry in offshore oil and so on. So we heavily rely on systems that have a level of seal integrity. But the problem is the seal integrity is that is a measurement we have found in advance when we are looking to test in laboratories and so on. It's not measuring how it actually performs in the scene of a fire. So the numbers we have doesn't always match up with what we suspect in the perfect conditions contra what happened the day we have a fire. Okay, sorry. No, I'm sorry. I probably talked too much, but yeah. I think this is very interesting because as a fire engineer, we have to start thinking about actually what we're doing and where do we find the data for what we are doing. To have people who talk a lot, that's the point of the podcast. I actually wanted to ask you something we talked about before the show. You've mentioned the reliability in the lab does not really reflect the reliability on C, which makes sense as well because of the conditions. Now, if we use statistical data to measure reliability of the systems, we technically use the data from the past. We use it now to design systems today that will work in the building for the next 20 years. So we did this projection of the past into a future in an environment which is so quickly changing. Like you've mentioned, these new technologies, these smart systems, on-grid valves, for example, that monitor the pressure flow, systems to monitor the pumps. It's not that you have to send a maintenance guy to measure the power on your turbo machinery now. You have the readings in your system. It's connected. It's online. It's available all the time. So we see into the systems in a way that we never did before. And in the future, I know there is work ongoing on predicting failure. It's not even about monitoring or capturing the failure. It's about investigating a behavior that may lead to a failure with a certain probability in a certain amount of time to switch on maintenance proactively. And then again, you know, all of this is happening around. In buildings, you would have systems that could be designed 20 years ago and built 10 years ago. You can have a new building that is designed today with old technology, with new technology. that is designed today with old technology, with new technology. Like, there's this variety of solutions available, each of them having some all-inherent reliability. And yet, in Eurocode, you have one number, you know. You have sprinklers, you reduce this fuel load by this number. You have sprinklers, you can go from two-hour fire resistance to one-hour fire resistance. Like, suddenly, none of this matters because you've put it together in one sack. But let's go to technology. How do you think our capability is to base the future on the past measurements, and what the challenges would be with that? That's a big question. What changes would be with that? That's a big question. One of the things that surprised me, because I've been looking into what kind of system we can have in the future, what kind of data can monitoring, for instance, think of systems, give us in the future. And it's surprisingly new knowledge that comes out of the readings on these systems today. Suddenly it's possible because, for instance, just one detail, and if you have a sprinkler valve, that has a big valve in the inside that goes up, it detects flow, and you have an alarm and so on. But there is also a bypass line on that with a small valve on. That is allowing pressure rise to go up into the sprinkler system without triggering the alarms. The system today now can actually monitor that the small valve doesn't work. It doesn't let the pressurized water from the mainstream into the system. So you can have a lot of new data from new systems or new on all systems in the future that will really do a big impact on rising the reliability on such systems. And this will not only come to sprinkler system, this will also come to fire detection systems. And it probably should also afterwards start to have systems that, for instance, monitoring ventilations. So you can actually find out if your compartmentization actually works. Is it tight? That's one of the big surprises for people who have experience with fire, is how big forces that is in place when you have a fire. That actually increases the pressure within the fire department into putting smoke and fire and whatever in the nearby compartments. Yes. What if we actually knew ahead that this compartment was not tight? Okay. This will really help us when we are trying to look into the buildings we are actually trying to save. Yeah. So the question about reliability is also a question about what will we do to maintain the buildings in the future with all these systems. And here is going to be a massive change in the future. And there's a lot of things that even we haven't thought about. It's somebody going to think about in a few years' time. I have a question that is going to be hella hard to answer. Okay. So, imagine a system in the future that the sprinkler system knows where the fire is, has electromagnetic valve on every sprinkler head, and you can proactively open them before your temperature breaks the bulb. So, for example, there's a fire in my office, the system knows there's a fire in my office, he knows that you need to start like four sprinklers at the same time, without waiting for the bulbs to break, to contain it. So from the reliability, how I understood it before, I lowered my reliability, because I've replaced a very robust solution, a bulb that will break in temperature, with a complicated system that has multiple failure points. I must detect the fire. I must proactively open the ‚Äì I must power the valves. You know, it starts to be complicated. But on the other end, I've removed the reliability you mentioned before that one head might not be enough. I can overflood the compartment in a way that even if this particular head did not control the fire, I know that the action of all of them around will. So I've lowered my reliability in the mechanical part I've increased it in the compartment fire part did I increase or lower my reliability as a number in the end yeah and that's probably true but then again back in the the basement where you have the the sprinkler central where the valves and so on this was also going to be there in the future, even if you have a new system like that. So the question is, does it really hire the reliability or not? And that's not easy to predict. And we actually don't know. And we have to be that kind of honest to say, we do not know everything. And that's the first scientific principle in general. We do not know everything. And if you start, is that your starting point? I think it's much, much easier to say to people that what we have done is done in our best practice and our best intentions, but we actually don't know everything. And we also have to continually improve ourselves and our data. And that's some of the things I'm rather missing in the pie science community today. There's a lot of words that gives the impression that we do know everything and that sprinkler system is going to fix everything. Waterler system is going to fix everything, water mister system is going to fix everything, composting station is going to fix everything, fire detection system is going to fix everything. Where does that come from? And that basic attitude that's really worrying me about the fire science community today, because we do actually don't know everything that's very very important to put up i also doubt we're measuring the correct things actually as we go yeah if we base like you started with that and that was a trigger point for you in your path but i think it could be a trigger point for many of us if you base your predictions predictions on an incomplete data, or projections from basically yes-no questionnaire, did the sprinkler system exist? Yes, no. That's not an information. That's a statement of the best. If we try to project our engineering, our sophisticated system on incomplete data, we're not going to have a good time. Our capacity to engineer is hindered. Maybe we would need less data, but more reliable data, you know. Maybe not 100,000 of questionnaires, but 100, but really well sorted. Or maybe some data from, I don't even know where to seek it, but I assume it must exist, this high fidelity data that you could filter out of the noise and then truly see the true picture. And it's not easy. We have to be clear about that. It's not easy to see the whole picture. We have to be clear about that. It's not easy to see the whole picture. That's one of the main things. One of the things that worries me now in these days is, for instance, massive timber buildings. First of all, we have some fire hazard there. Timber burns quite well. So even if the construction will stand for a fire for a long time, it will still burn. And we actually are not so much interested in burning. We're actually most interested in putting out the fire if it occurs. But then again, sprinkler comes in like a saving night. On a white horse. On a white horse even, yeah. But I have started to think about what does really happen with timber and water. And one of the things we are actually starting to look into now is that water and timber is not that good connection as we assume, because when the timber starts to get wet, it swells. And suddenly the compartment station that was done by the fire engineer is broken because one wall suddenly arises 10 centimeters, 5 centimeters. And the fire has the possibility to go on. I see. You even have the possibility that the timber itself, because when it starts to get wet, it starts to have much more of the same characteristics as steel in heat. It's weak in its construction. And suddenly the system you put into place to control the fire and even put out the fire is actually working to destabilization the whole building. And sorry to interrupt you, but this is another interesting aspect of reliability, which is the times when the system activated where there was no fire. And in here, we start to talk about very severe consequences of that, which is, in fact, interestingly very common in ESFR systems, because if you accidentally trigger ESFR system, you're not going to have a great time. But at the same time, if you trigger that kind of system, you trigger it normally in the storage house, warehouse, or whatever. Concrete on the floor, it's not that big issue. You have to keep concrete on the floor and so on. It's not that big issue. You have some goods destroyed whatsoever. But if you start to do that in the same thing in a building, many, many floors all build with timber. You have big issues. In Norway, for a couple of weeks ago, we have a new library with a lot of treasures that had a fire, and the sprinkler system started to work, and it started to work really well. It put out a fire. But during the 20 minutes it was on, they put out between 4,000 and 5,000 liters of water from the fourth floor and down. And all this has to be collected and dried out. And suddenly you start realizing this is going to give a lot of damage, a lot of damage. Did we think about it? Was the sprinkler system the best system in a high-rise library, or was it not? And that's the case. We haven't thought about the consequences, which is also one of the parts we have to put into consideration. Yeah, I think this is the point of the podcast when there's champagne bottles popping in the water mist industry. Yeah, but I love active systems. I really love active systems. So I try to figure out what is the best system for the best building. So in my industry, you have people either collected in the sprinkler camp or you have the water mist camp or you have the gas camp. It's not that interesting. It's the most interesting to find the best system for the building you're actually going to protect. I agree the same. And it's technologies that exist, and they all have their best applications. They have average applications, and they have bad applications. And I think collectively, we should tend to put the best systems in the place where they operate. The best, not necessarily only on the basis of the cost of investment or the cost of whatever there is. It should be beyond just money. Just put the best system in the place where it should be. I love the fact that you brought up mass timber, because for me, it also is a place where this reliability is even more important than elsewhere. Because if you bet the survival of your structure on the fact that the system operated, then the reliability of the system is not just on putting the fire. It suddenly becomes the reliability, the inherent reliability of the building itself. It becomes the single point of failure of the building as a whole thing. And suddenly you cannot bet on a system that would have 80% of reliability. I'm not okay losing one in five buildings that have a fire in. And I had many episodes on timber and fire in this podcast and there's great resources popping out everywhere about this. I hope we can finally get with the message to the mass timber industry that it's not that we do not want timber buildings because we don't like the concept or something. We just don't want to be blamed for another grant. You know, we know the challenges. We see the dangers. We just want an open conversation about how to manage them, not to say that you shouldn't build from timber. But that's a completely other discussion. Let's go back to the ability. Yeah, but it belongs into the picture because we have to talk rather broadly about the issues we are trying to face and trying to say that we actually know everything is very bad. Yeah. My last question is related to the numbers themselves you've mentioned. You've opened the episode with that 100% in Australia, 95% in the U.S., 88% in a different view. But to what extent the sprinkler reliability in Norway is the same as the one in Poland? Can you even translate that or these minuscule differences between the cultures, the engineering cultures in our countries, make these numbers also valid only within, let's say, a law system, a country, a geographic area, a code area? Well, I remember I had my first presentation on this in Norway. That presentation, there was also members from the scientific community in Norway that had been a big part in putting in the regulation that we also have to have sprinkler systems in Norway. And they had relied very much on the data from a board without questioning the data. It also was a big surprise that there was obviously things in the service that they should have or at least have put questions into, but they didn't. And that's one of the things that really bothers me and still bothers me because there is a consumption and idea within a lot of communities that actually knows what they are doing. And when you try to tell them, I find it a little bit difficult because I look into this and this is what findings I have. They are just stumped, quiet. It doesn't happen anything. And that's one of the things that's been really hard to understand. Why doesn't people act on the information that's been given? That's really hard to understand. But I think that the sprinkler reliability in general, when we look to all systems and all the buildings that are from residential to high-rise buildings and so on, we probably is somewhere between 85 to 95 percent. As a general number? As a general number. But we should actually try to find out numbers for residential buildings, for storehouses and for... Narrow it down to occupation type of aler of course because when we do our engineering we are looking into what kind of risk is there what kind of hazard is in this building and try to find out where does it fit in our diagram and that's very important but we need to have some numbers and from your research from your research, do you see a simple measure to, I don't know, double the reliability in my building? Redundancy, control, monitoring? What do you think would have the biggest? If I was to design a building today and someone told me, okay, sprinklers have between 85 to 95, where I would find the missing percentages to go to 99. I would say that the first thing you have to do is find the right system for the right building. That's number one. That's number one. So, fix the compartment with fire reliability of the system and max it out. Yeah. And one of the things that I've done as a chairman of the Norwegian board of fire science here in Norway was that last year we put out the guidings for how engineers that work within both fire safety, fire alarms, extinguishing systems, and the guiding systems should work together to try to figure out the best solutions. And that's one of the things that is number two in this. We have to start talking together because somebody is very, very good at looking at the compartment and escape routes and so on. Others is really good in extinguishing systems. Somebody is really good in fire alarms and so on. And we have to start to talk even in the starting point on the project. Not after an engineer has laid out a whole concept for fire engineering and the engineer that's going to do the fire extinguishing system is looking at it. Have you really thought about this? No, I can't see that. And you have to have a big discussion to try to figure out how to change everything because the concept has already been written. The second step is that we actually have to talk together and work together before we put a concept into a financialization on the paper. And the third part is, I think, to have make the owner of the building to really understand the system is heavily dependent on what the things he is doing in the future. Then I will presume that the reliability in general will really go up. Thank you so much for these interesting thoughts. It was such a good conversation. Maybe you want to make a closing statement. Let's advertise your book a bit as well. Well, there could be a lot of concluding statements here, but for me it's become more and more important that we actually work together and instead of standing in our group or standing on our hill there is a lot of people that actually is interested in learning and talking and give their information and their knowledge to another. And I think that it depends heavily on us to start a new way to work within the fire safety community in general and what we have done in the previous years, because there is no doubt that to work together gets better results than working solo and expect everybody else just to follow you. That would probably be my last statement. I highly appreciate you. Out of all of this, you've picked this one because it's something that is jumping out in this podcast a lot. And actually, whenever I speak to someone, it usually ends up with this lack of conversation, lack of understanding the issues, the holistic view. It's not that we miss numbers, not that we miss technology. We sometimes miss a simple discussion. I think it's a powerful statement, and I hope the industry is going to change in this regard a lot. And I also hope that the future will bring us data on true reliability that we can incorporate in our engineering and take informed decisions based on a measure that we understand how to analyze, collect, and validate, like you said. So that would be a nice feature. Yeah, I've really put out some measures for the extinguishing community as well. And that would be that it is very, very helpful if you do what I call extinguishing analysis in the project. To list up what is the goals from this project, what is the goals of the owner of the building with the systems, and out of that make a suggestion on a system. Sometimes I come up only with one solution, but often I come up with two solutions with different benefits and different drawbacks. And the owner itself also can be part of the decision part. What does we want the system to do and why? For people who really love extinguishing systems, I would really suggest that that would be a very fruitful way in the future so that the whole industry is much more perceived as a try to figure out solution than standing on its own points fantastic thank you so much Einstein it was a huge pleasure to uh have you in the Firesense show and see you somewhere soon I hope yeah that would be really nice. It would be really a pleasure to be here on your show. And there's a lot of people that are listening into your show. So your work, what you're doing is really important. So I will just encourage you to stay with that in the future. Oh, I am, I am. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. You can give me an invitation to come and give you some work at your school. I could try to teach a little bit to your students about this if you think that would be helpful. Very helpful. I would appreciate that a lot. Thank you so much, and see you around. Cheers. Cheers. And that's it. I hope you've enjoyed it. I certainly did. I Cheers. And that's it. I hope you've enjoyed it. I certainly did. I knew it's going to be nice to have Arnstein again in the show and discuss the reliability with him. And I was not disappointed and actually quite pleased with his concluding statements that we need to look beyond our silos, that we need to think more about what goals do we want to achieve from safety systems in our buildings, that we need to talk to each other, that we need to put more thought into how we are designing systems so they are the best fit for the building. And I actually didn't expect a discussion on reliability to go into such an ending that we will be discussing the engineering in fundamental. But yeah, it makes sense. Reliable systems are good systems, systems that work, that operate correctly. It's not just the probability of failure in the reliability equation. There is so much more, and Arshten has covered it quite thoroughly, and I really, really enjoyed it. In the episode, we didn't really talk that much about the numbers because, well, that was not a point to give a number on reliability, but rather to discuss how it's being created. But if you want numbers, if you're looking for numbers, Einstein has published a book on reliabilities of sprinklers. It's called Reliability Data and Fire Sprinkle Systems, Collection Analysis, Presentation and Validationation and I would recommend it to you if you would like to learn more about what goes into this reliability equation and how it is measured and how it is validated and what does this number stand for. I guess for anyone who is dealing with sprinkler systems or general safety systems overall that could be a beneficial read. And that is it for today's episode. Thank you so much for being here with me. And as usual, see you next week. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
