 Hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show, Session 74. After last week's solo episode, we're back to the old interview format. And I again have a nice rising star of the fire safety engineering profession. So I have invited Dr. Andrea Luccherini, who is with Frisbee. It's a research institute at Slovenia. And it's an interesting project. I'm sure we are going to hear a lot more about it, hopefully also in the podcast. And Andrea is also affiliated with Ghent University. So very prolific young scientist and doing a lot of interesting, interesting research lately. But I've invited him to talk about his research that carries from master thesis through his PhD done at University of Queensland. And the subject of this work was on intumescent coatings or intumescent paints. Very interesting, very useful topic. Fire protection system that is used everywhere. Like, you see them everywhere. From fire protecting steel through timber, closing cavities, closing gaps, insulation joints. Intumescent coatings are finding more and more use in fire safety engineering, but it's interesting how they work, how they operate, what makes them differentiate between each other. It's a very, very large subject, to be honest. Very interesting subject, and that's exactly why Andrea is here. To understand from a scientist who's really researching this term, what are the things that make indumescent coating work, are the things that make indomestian coding work or maybe things that make it not work or maybe conditions in which they stop working or how do they differ from each other? That is really a huge topic and I hope we've done well to cover at least the fundamental principles of that because, wow, that's definitely not a subject for a single podcast episode. If you like it let me know and i'll guess i'll i can invite andrea to a follow-up where we can maybe talk a little more about modeling or some practical consequences of the physical properties that are being discussed here anyway no matter what your role in fire safety engineering is one day you will meet in two mess and coating So yeah, better learn them and understand how they work, so your job will be easier. So without further ado, let's spin the Inchman jump into the episode. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski, and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. Maybe based on the guest affiliation, I should call it Gans University Show lately. Hey, Andrea, good to have you here. Hello, hello, Wojciech. Today I'm having a nice talk with Dr. Andrea Luccherini of FreeSV Slovenia, which is under the ZAG Institute in Slovenia and also at Ghent University. That's my pun at the start. You're like third in a row affiliated with Ghent in the podcast. That makes me quite happy. Good place to be. So, Andrea, great to have you in the show. I brought you because there were some publications published lately that my professional colleagues have claimed are interesting if not groundbreaking. So I thought, okay, if that's your professional opinion, I'm going to get the author on podcast. And I've invited you to talk about intumescent paints. Then you were really angry with me for using the word paint. No, not too angry. And told me I should refer to it. I should call them intumescent coating. So start with that. What's this technology of intermescent coating and why should we call it like that? First of all, the difference between paint and coating, I mean, I don't think that there is any significant difference. What I find and also by reading a lot of literature, what I usually see that coatings is a more professional term. So to describe something that protects for example load-bearing structure that way the use of coatings okay paint sometimes it to me it sounds like less uh professional and more simplistic because this coating is a much more complex material and then hopefully during this episode i'll manage to explain you why it's complicated and also is what attracted me to this sort of field of research. Let's go there directly. It's not a very obvious choice when you pick from all the fancy stuff happening in FHIR. So how did you enter the path of researching intermescent coatings? I don't think it's a very popular pathway. No, it's not. I don't think it's a very popular pathway. No, it's not. Even though if you go into literature or if you check like web of science, there is a lot of research happening related to that because it's a big topic and also the product is used worldwide, more or less everywhere. Yeah. And it's a very modern way to protect, particularly everything started with steel structures, but it's something that is spreading around the world and now it's also now applying to different materials but in general what are intumescent coatings intumescent coatings are is a coating a paint which is usually applied in a very thin film that we discuss depending on the use because usually we have two categories of intumescent coatings we call it thin intumescent coatings or thick intumescent coatings. The thin intumescent coatings are the ones that we usually use them for the so-called cellulosic conditions. So it would be usually for the built environment where usually we have something similar or the standard far curve as a testing scenario. Okay. For the far resistant test, we use that far scenario to test the performance of that. So in the thin intumescent coatings, they're usually solvent-based or water-based, and they are usually applied in terms of a few millimeters. And what is peculiar about, maybe I can explain later, but just to compare, then we have the thick intumescent coatings. And the thick intumescent coatings instead are usually two-part coatings, are usually, for the majority, epoxy-based. So it's a more chunky coating that usually applies, instead of millimeters, one order of magnitude higher, so in terms of centimeters. Like a mass you would apply, not a paint. It's a thicker coating. And usually it's applied for conditions that are more demanding in terms of fire. So typically for the oil and gas industry, for so-called hydrocarbon conditions, it's usually the market of these coatings. Understood. And how did you end up researching this? Ah, yeah. So what happened, as I mentioned, in 2015, when I was at the end of my master's in construction engineering at the DTU, the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen, I was looking into different master's thesis, you know. And you're a master's student, you're excited, and it is the first sort of experience in research. and it is the first sort of experience in research. And I was asking around about people that could potentially, a professor could potentially offer a master's thesis topic. And I ended up in this extremely interesting topic related to intermessing coatings promoted by Professor Grunde-Yomas and Professor Luisa Giuliani at the TCU. So I picked it because I found it extremely interesting also because it's an extremely complicated problem and it's extremely fascinating. But what I did, I did this five, six month research. Based on the outcomes, I decided even to do my PhD based on that. Because what we did is, the first question we were trying to answer is that if we have two coatings for the same application, so we took two random commercial coatings for indoor application, for cellulosic conditions as I mentioned earlier. One was water-based, one was solvent-based. We applied on typically one section of a steel beam. It was an IP beam. And we exposed to different fire conditions. And we're trying to understand how would this coating behave if we exposed to different conditions, typically different heating rates, but we always achieve the same high temperatures. So mainly we did the most critical condition was the standard fire curve. So very high heating rates reaching 1100 degrees in about one hour. And then we did the same test using electric oven, but achieving that 1100 degrees in half an hour, two hours, and so on. So it was a different heating rate, but still the same temperature. so on. So it was a different heating rate, but still the same temperature. What we found extremely interesting is that the coating, since it was designed for more or less the same fire resistance glass, so it would achieve the behavior of the coating under the standard fire condition would have been more or less the same in the two cases. But what would happen between the two coatings, the scenario of the fire resistance test would represent the worst of the best scenario in the two coatings, the scenario of the fire resistance test would represent the worst of the best scenario in the two coatings. Because what happens is that what you imagine if you have a fire that grows slower, that you would sort of have allow longer time to the coating to swell. So you can sort of build a sort of more better foam that would protect it better and while in the other skies if you have like a very fast growing fire then potentially would create some sort of weakness in terms of cracking or parts that detach and everything but what we found out one coating had the best performance in terms of we sort of calculate inversely the thermal resistance or the effective thermal conductivity of this coating by taking the temperature of the protective steel. And we found out that in one case, the standard fire would represent the worst scenario, so would have the highest thermal conductivity, let's say. In the other case, the intumescent coating would represent the lowest thermal conductivity. Therefore, it's a matter of how do we understand the performance of these coatings? Is it the standard file representing the worst case scenario or the best case scenario? Because as you know, I also discussed with Piotr. As if someone has engineered the product to pass a test, huh? No, not at all. We never said that. Okay, okay. Well, it is like that. Anyway, to get to the bottom of why you've seen different performances and different conditions, because that's also what I hear from my colleagues at the laboratory. That's why a slow-hitting test was introduced, because it's not secret knowledge anymore. It's recognized knowledge that they will behave differently at different conditions. So to understand better why that happens, let's discuss how it works. So first of all, how intermescent coating works? Yeah, yeah. Where's the magic? So I'm not a chemical engineer. I'm not a chemist. So what I usually take, I take the approach of a fire safety engineer or a structural fire engineer that I take this magic formula. I apply for my purpose, keeping, for example, this, the temperature of a protect, of a steel column, stay cooler than when it's unprotected and then take it and understand if does the job that was my the whole concept behind it so what happens in the coating itself the coating is made of different components but usually you have three main components which is an acid an acid source you have a carbon source and then we have a blowing agent so what happens typically and now talking about i did a bit of studies during my research experience and i've been working into methane coating since for seven years since 2015 so i've seen some into methane coatings but not all of them for sure and so around 200 degrees let's say the acid starts sort of decomposing and the coating what you can see the coating starts sort of melting or softening. So the viscosity of this coating changes. Then a certain temperature, usually 300 degrees or something like that, the blowing agent activates. The blowing agent, what does, releases gases. These gases are released by the coating. And what happens, since the coating is sort of melted and or like a higher viscosity what happens the gas bubbles released by the blowing agent are trapped into this molten paint so what happens is start swelling by trapping these bubbles within its matrix okay so this is at the base of it and what happens is the coating something also i found during my phd is at the beginning i didn't know how this work because what you see in a standard furnace test you usually check the temperatures okay typically you see this magic plateau that happens around 300 350 degrees in your steel profile. And what happens is that the coating, by that temperature, as I mentioned, the blowing agent activates, so the coating starts swelling. So what it does is start having a sort of, we call it endothermic plateau, but it's not a proper endothermic reaction, because endothermic reaction is usually, you know, a reaction that absorbs a lot of heat. But in this case, the reaction takes some heat and uses to make the coating swelling and what the swelling does brings the fire farther from whatever you want to protect and then once you achieve this temperature the coatings start degrading so it happens something similar to timber so what you ever since is a high carbon in the coating so usually also this helps you in how it looks like as in color usually the coating the classic one is white then when it's supposed to heat it becomes black so it's a very high in carbon and then certain points start again becoming white and extremely brittle. What happens? Happens the classic oxidation at the surface. So carbon is released, oxidizes, is released through CO2, but also carbon is what keeps the coating together. And therefore the coating becomes, you know, weaker. Some parts start detaching, but also as happens to timber, what happens you have regression of the surface. So at the beginning it sort of swells and then little by little start retracting as well. Yeah, this is a very, very visual description and I like how the mechanism works. Like if you have a heat transfer through a solid, you would have some sort of thermal conductivity, the difference of temperatures and the distance. And here, of course, you probably modify the thermal conductivity to some extent, but the distance is the part where you act. So suddenly, instead of a few millimeters of paint or coating, you have 20, 30, 50 millimeters of foamed material with gases trapped inside, which are a very good insulator, are the layer between you and the fire, right? So, yeah, this is the tricky part of, you know, when you try to quantify the performance of the intermeshing coatings. Because if you're trying to quantify the thermal resistance, how it's defined, thermal resistance is both, you have both thermal conductivity and thickness included into that. It's easy because you take a sort of bulk thermal resistance of thermal protecting property of the material to protect the substrate once you instead you want to define the thermal conductivity then it becomes tricky because to define the thermal conductivity means you need to know the thickness all the time otherwise what people do typically the methodology is also is in the euro codecode for EN 11381 part 8. So in one of the annex, you can quantify sort of implicitly, effectively, what is the thermal conductivity by considering the initial thickness of the coating. So you have this sort of fake thermal conductivity because it takes into account everything that happens in the coating. That's almost like in particle physics, you cannot tell how quickly an electron moves or where it is at the same time. You either can measure the thermal conductivity or the length, not both at the same time. What an interesting twist to solve that. I mean, this is what I did during my PhD. It was one of my goals. I mean, what happens with intromess encodings, the problem, also what fascinates me is that it's such a complicated topic, because, first of all, you know, people usually associate intermess encoding to active file protection, passive file protection. I usually like to define it as reactive file protection, because it's not an active, because you don't have to activate a file extinguisher. It's not a passive that has a board that stays there all the time. It's something that reacts. And since it reacts, we should consider that there are many aspects that could be affected. They could affect the reaction of the coding. And what I found also doing at the beginning of my PhD, doing a bit of literature review, I found out that there is a lot of things that influence the intonation coding behavior. I can make some examples. I don't know if you're interested in most of them. I can talk about intonation coding as much as you want. Worst case, I'll cut them out. Yeah. I mean, first of all, I'm not an expert, but the first main thing that influences the whole story is the composition. It's the composition, but this is something that I didn't dig into detail because I took, as I said earlier, the approach of a fire-sift engineer, structure-fying engineer, take a product, understand, does this coating work or not? That's the question. Then I start looking at what are the variables that could affect the 2-messing coating behavior. The first one is the classic one that we discussed also far, is the heating conditions. Heating conditions that is also considered as, you know, overall fire conditions or testing conditions, because you can apply a heat flux that is pure radiant using a cone or a panel. can apply mix of radiative and convective in a standard furnace but also one of the key aspects also influences as many other aspects in first engineering is oxygen content what people have seen that you know in for example during my phd i use some radiant panels so very high oxygen content around the coating it's completely different situation than having a furnace when you have relatively low oxygen content within that and for example you know if you have a low oxygen content what i was discussing earlier about oxidation and char regression and what happens you have a much lower phenomena if you have low oxygen then so as so as I mentioned, heat test methods in general, but also heating conditions, fast-growing fire, temperature, heat fluxes, and things like that. Then another main importance is the thickness and mainly how much coating you apply because it sort of defines the mass and the quantity of your coating. Then you have the substrate conditions that I also look into that a bit during my PhD. And also we can discuss this. It was another very hot topic of intermescent coatings is that, you know, we always test intermescent coatings when they are perfect, virgin, and just applied. But what happens since it's a reactive material, what happens to the reaction in a 5, 10, 20 years time. Because usually design buildings for, I don't know, a design life of 50 years. And we need to make sure that that reaction and that material works also in a 50 years time. In our lab, when we did the tests, we did this artificial aging of the coating by exposing it to different conditions, salt, radiation, ultraviolet, water, and so on. So when they come and the part that comes for the age testing doesn't look very white or nice, to be honest. But it's always a question like to what extent this gives us gives us a feeling of what happens actually i'll tell you a funny story it's not about paint but more like the epoxy coating that you've mentioned before we had a client um they've purchased an old building in warsaw but not super old but let's say medium old which had a steel structure protected by coatings and And they wanted to see what is, how does it really look like? Is this steel structure underneath very healthy or unhealthy? What stage is it in? So they basically went into the structures. Some parts they just cut out with the steel. Some parts they just opened the hole in the coating just to check what's the corrosion underneath. So they've opened like 100 samples under 30 or 40-year-old steel structure protected with that coating. And then they come to us and like, okay, and what do we do now? How are we supposed to fill the gaps we just made? Because the coating is not existing. We have a 30-year-old material on the building, so you cannot just plump a speck of very fresh coating inside and expect the exact same behavior. There is no paperwork that would allow it. It was like, okay, I shouldn't laugh at it, but it ended up as being quite a hilarious issue because the steel was very healthy, no damage at all, but now they ended up with a structure with tons of holes in their fire protection there is a bit of research related to that that is the university of naples in italy that they look into what happens so they took like an existing structure they publish in construction building materials very interesting research and they look at how was reactive the coating 30 years later. And what they saw is that, you know, the coating was not in the best state and you could never, you know, assume the same performance as a virgin coating. But also they showed that, you know, the coating can be removed, they reapplied, but also it could be also applied an additional layer on top of it and will still be effective. Okay. that's interesting. Like, you have an old one, as long as you have adhesion for the new one, you can apply the new one. Exactly. But you cannot, like, just apply a giant amount of it, because it is quite fragile. It will start falling. Yeah. There's a reason why they tell you, like, what's the layer. It's not just about the minimum amount of coating that you apply, but it's also, in a way, optimal. Because if you overshoot that, you will also, by force of gravity, it will damage. To finish out the chemistry and heat transfer part, so you've mentioned that at around 200 degrees, there would be the action of the acid that makes it softer, so the bubbles can actually alter the material. Then at 300, you would have the blowing material go on. What happens if it hits up to 200 and just stops for an hour, like a traveling fire scenario? Yeah, this is an interesting topic. I did a bit of research during my PhD because I was interested about that. I did a bit of research during my PhD because I was interested about that. And because at the back of that, we had some research that was carried out by my PhD supervisor, Christian Malouk, at the University of Edinburgh. Okay. That what they saw is that having a potentially, let's call it a slow-growing fire or a preheating scenario in certain coatings might create specific weakness into that. And what they saw is that, for example, that the coating, if it was exposed to slow heating, it would delaminate because what happens, you start melting it. And then once it's melted, the blowing agent and the gases cannot be trapped. So you sort of break the paint. And it's a sort of process of cooking off the coating. Like when you cook something in your oven at the brown temperature you know and then okay for example a cake it doesn't grow it works in the same concept so i tried to do a bit of tests and a bit of experiments even and it was like a qualitative and i was surprised because the coating i used was working very well even if i cooked the coating for about an hour, the heat flux that would not swell was about 10 kilowatts. So usually it's like for low temperatures. Then the coating would keep swelling even after the preheating or pre-cooking phase. But this is again, what I found out is within my PhD, I look into certain, and of certain amount of my history, I've looked into certain products. But products are continuously optimized, created, commercialized, that is very hard to keep up with all the coatings that are produced and sold in the world. This is one, actually, of the main shortcomings of my PhD that I mentioned. I did, at the base of that, I took one coating and I did experiments to understand the fundamental aspects of the coating. But then the next step that has to be done is that to take the same concept and to see if this concept can be applied to also all the others. Most likely for some not, for some, yes, but it's tricky and challenging, particularly because one of the problems we have with intumescent coating research is that it's very hard and typically the name of the product are not disclosed because these magic formulations are usually hidden and manufacturers, they care a lot about protecting potentially their IP related to the coding. And they can have, you know, good advertisement from successful tests. They can have bad advertisement, but usually you find a lot of tests, but usually you never know if they are connected to a product, another product or things like that. know if they are connected to a product, another product, or things like that. As a short, that's one of the hardest parts of working in this field because you have all these proprietary requirements that it's hard to compare or extend your study to other materials. When we talk about the behavior of steel or concrete, it's usually like you don't need very much to quite well define the material to have full reproducibility of the results in another laboratory. When you talk about something so highly protected, as you said, there's a lot of chemistry inside. So it's the IP of the manufacturer of the paint or the coating. I guess it's these tiny of the manufacturer of the paint or the coating. I guess it's these tiny details that make or break a certain application of the coating. Yeah, definitely. Like you mentioned early in your master thesis research where you had to change one water base, one solvent base, and outcomes so far from each other. Yeah. outcomes so far from each other. Going forward with how this works in the buildings, I wondered what happens when the swelling coating meets an obstacle? Let's say there's a concrete beam or something next to a steel column that blocks it in a way, so you cannot expand to the certain thickness or someone puts an obstacle. Yeah, I mean, this is a super interesting topic. And we also did a bit of studies at the UQ, the University of Queensland in Australia during my PhD, because we are continuously asked about this. What I can tell you is that, first of all, manufacturers usually suggest potentially a minimum distance at which any obstacle can be applied in front of the intumescent coating element. And that also, this is related to, for example, if we discuss about thin and thick intumescent coatings. Because thin intumescent coatings, literature says that can swell up to 100 times their original thickness. So from few millimeters, they go to 10, 20 centimeters, while thick intumescent coatings, they usually swell, you know, 15, 20 times their thickness. So what people usually suggest manufacturers to avoid this problem is they suggest that at least the 50 diameters, they have to be left free in the case of thin intumescent coatings or 10, 20 diameters in the case of thick intumescent coatings. What actually happens is that at the base of all that and what I found during my PhD is that intumescent coatings, their amazing characteristics and amazing protective performance is based on the swelling. It's based on the concept of taking the fire away from the substrate. If you stop the swelling, then you immediately have a weakness. And we found this by doing some certain experiments at University of Queensland that we applied sort of heat flux on the surface of the coating. We used a mesh to sort of block the swelling. And we saw that mainly since they also the obstacle heats up so it also increases the conductive heat transfer for the coating then you have a of course a lower performance but then i also always wonder that we should always always think in engineering terms in terms of if there is an obstacle, is going to be the fire reaching the structure or the protected element? Because certain aspects can fall. You know, if you have an aluminum sheet in front of it, we know aluminum would potentially melt at relatively low temperatures compared to, you know, a temperature where the steel structure can be affected. So I think we have to also think a bit in engineering terms and solve the overall problem. Potentially, the obstacle can also block the fire, not just the swelling. We will also shield from radiation in a way. It's a way more complicated manner than just... But does the swelling... Is there a force in this swelling? I don't know how to precisely tell it. Can it push an object away if I put a bottle of water next to a wall? What I can tell you is that if we discuss about big numbers, it's like thin intermescent coatings are applied in terms of millimeters. Okay? So a few millimeters. About, you know, depends on the coating, but 40, 50%, 60% are potentially made of volatiles. So are these blowing agent that will blow the gases. And so we discuss about densities when of this swelled coating of about 50, 100 kilos per cubic meter. So it's not anything tough or robust that is pushing things away. No, the coating is very fragile when it actually swells. And actually when it's oxidized, it's even weaker. So sometimes you can just blow it and then it falls away. Yeah, that is where I was going with it. And to what extent it's fragile in a real case of fire? Like next to a fire plume, you can have seven, eight meters per second of airflow just because of the convective action. But I see them being used like near jet fans in car parks. No jet fan outlet, 20 meters per second. That's a lot. And it looks fragile to me. If I look at it, I wondered, have you ever observed in your research, like, in a way, mechanical failure of a coating, like being blown away from the protective element? I mean, what happens in a furnace usually doesn't have requirements in, you know, velocities. So it's something that you sort of implicitly see, because when you open the furnace at the end of the test you see some parts of the coating that are detached on the floor or even like sucked away from the exhaust but an interesting study that i started during my phd was a study that i did in 2016 at the rice and there was robert johnson and mcnamara that they sort of did a sort of bench scale test. And they created some sort of jet flame scenario. And they exposed some coatings to a far scenario. And they saw that, yeah, the coating would touch pretty easily. So it's definitely a weakness. How to quantify what's the extent of this weakness is something that is extremely complicated. And I have been investigated during my PhD. Now what comes to my mind is that intermessage materials would also be often used for cavity barriers sealing in facades and in a cavity or facade you can have fairly high velocities of air just because of the convective airstream. Wow, this is going well. I love the world of magical paint. Okay, let's go further. Next thing on my list. You mentioned you were testing them in furnaces. You were using H3s, I guess, Apartheid, which is a radiant panel in front of this. These are fairly small-scale test units. Do you have an experience with the behavior of this in a full-scale, in a compartment setting? I guess there are also real-case fires where this works, basically. If it didn't work in real fires, we would know already, I guess. Yeah. Okay. First of all, during my PhD, I tested in a bench scale setup because what I started as the idea is that I mentioned earlier that the intumescent coating behavior is affected by many different aspects. And what I wanted to do, I wanted to take a coating, apply on a very well defined thermal boundary conditions, both at the surface, but also the substrate, wanted to take a coating, apply on a very well-defined thermal boundary conditions, both at the surface, but also the substrate, and to see as soon as I change certain aspects, how the coating behave. So what I found out is that I was using mainly using steel plates coated with different thicknesses of intumescent coating, and I was changing the thermal boundary condition at surface, the fire scenario, and also the thermal boundary conditions at the substrate. I found out that, first of all, the fire scenario, the heating condition, what they control, they control the swelling rate. And also, the swelling rate means how fast this coating swells. But also, I also found out, and I tried to define which are the condition to make the coating swelling because there are some conditions that you know below a certain temperature or below a certain heat flux the coating doesn't swell and i call it i have a study and a paper related to that focused on onset of swelling of intumescent coatings then i was looking at the thickness of the the initial thickness of the coating. And what I found out, if you fix the thermal boundary condition, the heating condition of the coating, what the thickness does evaluates how much the coating can swell, potential is well. Because this is a sort of like, you know, mass balance. You have a certain amount of mass. The coating can swell a certain amount. Therefore, I found that with a linear relationship within the range that I tested, that the maximum swell coating thickness can be related to the initial thickness. Okay. And then also I did the last aspect about the thermal boundary condition of the substrate, because this came out, and we can discuss later, that now intumescent coatings are pushed to be applied also to other, not just steel, but also other substrate materials, timber, concrete, things like that. And what happens, you change, by changing the material, you change the thermal properties of how this material would behave, particularly would behave close to the surface of the material. Therefore, where the coating sits and where the coating swells. And what I found out that we can discuss in the case of highly insulating material, so heat doesn't penetrate through the material, then the coating swells much faster because mainly all the heat is concentrated in the coating. And this is the case, for example, of timber. Then if you have the case of a thick steel plate, then this is a sort of lumped, the heat, because steel has a high thermal inertia, so it has to heat up gradually, so therefore the swelling behaves slower. Then, if you have something, I did a study on a heat sink, so there was a steel plate, and at the back, I had a sort of radiator system. There was a steel plate that was cooled with water and it was taking heat away the other side. And what I found out that the coating, all the heat that was receiving the coating was actually leaving the coating because there was like a, you know, it's a sort of energy balance of the coating. It's the energy that comes from the fire and the energy that leaves from the substrate. So you have to do an energy balance of that, and you can understand how the coatings well. Oh man, I find biode number annoying enough as it is. Yeah. And if you add now to the problem the fact that your dimension changes with time as this progresses, and your biode number most likely changes as well as it progresses oh boy that's um yeah complexity of fire so that that was a mention that all the different aspects that changes it and this is the case of 1d heat transfer is a plate with a hot surface on one side and some sort of thermal boundary conditions a substrate the substrate. Then, going back to your question, what happens in large scale? In the large scale, you have another bunch of phenomena, not just to mention in a compartment fire, you might have convective gases, so you might have speeds. I mentioned about a different level of oxygens, but also another aspect that I found and there is also some research related to that, is the shape of the substrate. Because what you can imagine, if you have a concave or a convex angle with the coating, then you can have, you know, in a concave angle, you have much more coating than the surface to protect. Therefore, they have much more coating and that angle will be nicely protected. much more coating, and that angle will be nicely protected. Instead, if you have, for example, the top or the bottom flange on a steel beam, it's a sort of very rough, acute angle, then in that case you have very little coating, but a very big surface to cover. It's geometry, you know? Must be fun for circular, like, pipes. Yeah. That's also, in circular pipes, it's a bit more homogeneous geometry. So it's a sort of swells all together. But when you have these sort of very sharp angles, then you might have a sort of thermal bridge, then heat can penetrate through that. So it's such a complicated topic that you try to solve one aspect, and then you forgot another. The definition of failure is also not very sharp in here. Like, I guess by experience, you can have some of this fail, some of this not swell perfectly, and yet still achieve the expected performance from the larger point of view. That's what I've been told in the laboratory, that you have a certain amount of measurement points, you average them, there's criteria for some of them. You don't need the most perfect uniform action on all of the surfaces, all at the same time to achieve the benefit of the fire protection, right? This is how they're designed in mines, right? The framework we have now we have some strength but also we have serious weaknesses because you know still for if we apply intumescent coatings to protect a steel column that would have you know free for exposure to a fire having a large-scale experiment is still the most representative scenario because in the end, for structural engineering purposes, you want to keep the temperature of the steel low or below a certain critical temperature, whatever is defined. The importance is also something that Piotr highlighted in his episode, is are we aware that certain key parameters of this framework can strongly affect the performance of these materials? What Pietro mentioned, that at the beginning, the first 10 minutes of the standard furnace test, anything can happen. And in that period of time is when the coating swells. For example, the coating has been designed to be very reactive to a very fast thermal shock, the classic very fast-growing fire of a very fast-growing fire of standard temperature time curve. So it works very well in that scenario. So maybe an intumescent manufacturer would prefer to have a very big push on the temperature at the beginning because it sort of activates and fosters the reactivity and the performance of this coating. But then, you know, that thermal boundary condition controls the whole story. I would say that what makes the coating really work in the fire? I mean, once it swells, it's basically down to Fourier problem. It's transfer problem. If it has this depth and this thermal conductivity, it will achieve this performance. It's simple physics. If the thermal boundary condition is known. So from 10th minute of the test, you basically, like you could stop the test at that point. Because if you know the external temperature and basic parameters of a perfectly swollen coating, it's a heat transfer problem. But what makes it or breaks it, does this achieve this level of swelling in the first minute? Was it capable of reaching this point where it's activated? The process of swelling takes time and it's not something particularly the more coating you put, the thicker thickness, the longer it's going to take. Then how long does it take when you start degrading the coating and everything? That is something that depends test by test. But for me, it's that since at the base of everything, the motivation of my research is that we assume that the scenario we're testing, motivation of my research is that we assume that the scenario we're testing so fast growing and very high temperature fire is the most critical scenario for a structure but is it the most critical scenario for the performance of an intumescent coating that's another story yeah and and as you know as we engineers, manufacturers, they are smart enough to optimize their products for the only scenario that are required to be tested. So it's not a variable anymore. They take that the fire scenario is defined and then they have to play with all the rest. They can look at, you know, char, strength, swelling rate. So it's an extremely complicated topic and very challenging to work with that. We're entering dangerous grounds. I must stop you there. I like my knees like they are, unshot. So, yeah. But yeah, you're correct. That's the battle we have, like optimizing for a test standard and not understanding the full performance in the real building. And there is nothing like standards are used to rank materials, to classify materials, to safely put materials on the market, to assure that materials do have characteristics they claim to have. It's a very important part and something that worked very well for the last hundred years in providing safety for people, for masses. The practical performance is something else, right? What I can say is that there is a bit of movement into this because with a big push of performance-based design, you know, the big assumption that usually fire safety engineers do is that they assume the performance of any into mass encoding in any other scenario, which is the biggest assumption and most dangerous one for me. But now there is a bit of push in having a better and deeper understanding on how this material would behave also in different conditions. And manufacturers are aware, and also I think there should be something I've been trying to push with my research, try to push for more understanding and more conditions to understand if this coating would behave in the dangerous situations or for structure. And there are some manufacturers that are pushing for this change and are pushing for optimizing the product, not only for one condition, but also others. And they should get credit for that because they produce a product which is reliable. And since domestic codec is an expensive product for when you consider the different file protection of various structures. So it's something that we should reward for people that are trying to really understand if the product is robust. Absolutely. Amen to that, 100%. Okay, so we're nearing the end of the episode, but I really wanted to ask you about your future plans. There's a question for intermescent paints that really connects to that very well. To what extent we can protect timber with these types of solutions? I saw that uh happening lately it was very interesting to me i mean the the concept is of course we can we have to make sure and we saw already application it's not just concrete it's not just uh timber but people have been also applying to mass encodings on concrete to improve example, to reduce the temperature within the rebars in concrete. For example, in historical buildings where you cannot change the section of an element, but you have to increase the fire protection. So you just apply a thin coating and you get the class that you're required to improve. But also to mitigate falling sometimes. We have been seeing some research that has been used for this purpose. For timber, the story is slightly different, because I've seen and I worked also during my PhD on successful products, into mass encodings applied on timber, and there are certain aspects to consider. First of all is the adhesion between the two substrates. So for some aspects, the coating might have a much better adhesion to the substrate because what happens, timber is hygroscopic. So what happens absorbs what is the surface. So some part of the coating can be absorbed within the matrix of the timber, the surface, and therefore ensure adhesion at the surface. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? It's a good thing. Okay. Because it gets and you have therefore ensure adhesion at the surface is that a good thing or a bad thing is a good thing okay because it gets and you have a better adhesion then the other aspects is the difference between critical temperatures let's go like that in the two substrates steel and timber in steel there you know you have critical temperatures above you know five six hundred degrees but then the substrate stays more or less in the same way during the fire. Timber, what happens around, you know, 200, 300 degrees, this pyrolysis and charring process starts. So what you could have, and what I mentioned earlier, intumescent coatings, they typically swell for temperature for 300, 400 degrees. So what you see is that when the coating starts swelling, the surface of the timber start charring as well and this could be tricky for the adhesion not of the coating on the timber but the adhesion of the char on the timber but then again if the coating starts swelling you have the adhesion what's mainly you have again a big endothermic process that mainly plateaus the surface. And what happens if you make sure that the coating stays at the surface, you can mainly postpone the onset of swelling because you have like a delay. Plus, if the coating stays there, you have something that protects. So potentially, the charring rate of the timber can be also reduced. That's so complicated. In theory, it sounds amazing. In theory, it sounds amazing. In theory, it sounds amazing. In practice, we need to see experiments and tests related to that. I find that we're living in two different worlds. In one, painting a surface is such an easy task and it's such an easy solution. You just paint it, do the primer, do the coating, do the external layer, you're done. The bucket says it's 60 minutes, you're very happy. But the chemistry, the physics that goes inside, the beautiful complication of heat transfer that is suddenly changing in time and space at the same time. I understand why this subject was so attractive to you, because it's such a complicated manner and very, very interesting one. The just last thing I wanted to mention is that what I tried to do during my PhD, during my research, is to understand what are the fundamental factors that affect the behavior of these materials. Because only in that way we can design a test, experiment, whatever you want to call it, that allows us to understand if the product will do the purpose. And we don't know at the moment, unfortunately. We spend a lot of money, but we don't know. Well, we know a bit more. You've successfully made modeling attempts. You've described many of the phenomena in there. So certainly thanks to your endeavor, we are much richer in knowledge in this regard. I will definitely link all I found with your name on it about intermescent paints in the show notes. And yeah, Andrea, thank you very much. Brilliant young scientist developing so quickly. Watch this space, guys. This space is good. It's interesting to see you grow and see your future findings. Thank you very much, Wojciech. It was my pleasure to be here, particularly after the big names that I've been listening and that I've been admiring and study from over the last, you know, 10 years of fire safety engineering. So my pleasure. Thank you very much and see you around. Cheers, man. Cheers. And that's it. Thank you for listening. Hope you've enjoyed this conversation. There are things that I wanted to cover, but we haven't had a chance to touch them. One being modeling into mess and coatings. That's a very interesting subject that Andrea has actually done in his PhD. It's linked in the papers in the show notes of the episode if you want to read about it. But it's something definitely that could be covered on the podcast episode. So maybe a topic for a future. One thing we didn't touch is debunking myths of some magical pains that are on the market. Actually, that calls for a podcast episode on its own as well. On why precisely these magical pains that withstand little blowers like heroes do not really provide you a good protection against real fires in the world. Well, hopefully that will be covered one day, and maybe for some sort of celebratory episode, that would be a topic I would enjoy demolishing on. So yeah, certainly something for the future. Anyway, thank you, Andrea, for coming to the Firesense show. It was a pleasure to have you. Thank you all for listening to this podcast. If you have something to share about intermessing coatings or if you want me to cover some other aspects of the subject brought in here or maybe bring more fire safety engineering in terms of solutions applied to provide safety in buildings. Let me know in the comments. So I know what topics excite you most, and looking at just the roll numbers, it's not always the best indicator of what's being popular in here. However, I think you may enjoy episodes that cover technologies because that's something we always deal with, and not only philosophical or very ivory tower topics, but down-to-earth engineering and why stuff works and when it stops. I think that's fundamental to understand as a fire safety engineer. So thank you for being here. And next week, well, actually next week, there's going to be a super exciting, super interesting topic. Not very practical today, but absolutely exciting for any fire safety engineer. I'm not going to spoil you. You're going to see you for listening and see you soon.
