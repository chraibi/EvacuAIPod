Introduction by Enrico Ronchi

Is so I think it's nine sharp. I don't know, Erica, if my clock is. Nope, it's time, that's time. So welcome everyone to this fires webinar series. My name is Enrico Ronchi and together with Erica koligowski also here. We are co leading the human verifiers group permanent group of the International Association for Fire Safety Science. 
This is our webinar series, which is now at its seventh if I'm not mistaken episode, and today I'm very pleased to introduce Hannah neimanova from the Czech Technical University of Prague. They will talk about the topic, the key topic of our research activities, that is, evocation of preschool children. So she will give an overview about her PhD work in this domain and all the interesting information that she collected about preschool children evacuation. 
Before we start, I have a couple of information. First of all, as mentioned this webinar. series is part of a set of activities that we are doing within the permanent group of called in fire. 
So ifss, and this includes this webinar sales, but also as a one of the key activity that we are carrying out, led by Erica, is the development of a research agenda concerning umbia wearing fires, and this is applied both to building fires as well as wildfires, so outdoor fire videos. This in this webinar series. 
I have to acknowledge the help from one of my PhD student, heart to royert, which is here behind the scenes, making sure that everything works, and one important aspect that is taking care of is that those events are recorded, because we then post them on our YouTube channel. We have a YouTube channel of our webinar Series in which we actually post all the recordings, so if anyone wants to watch. 
This offline, send it to friends or send it to colleagues, and so on. All the webinars are recorded and then shared publicly, so authorizing that as posted also the link to the YouTube channel, so you can also just sign up to the YouTube channel if you want to be kept updated. 
One more thing: within the activities of the human fires group, we will have a workshop space within the next ifss conference, International Association of Fire Safety Science conference, which is happening in October in Japan. So we're really exciting to visit Japan and to have this activities. So we have started the planning of this workshop and you will hear from us with more information so related to this. 
If you want to be kept updated on our activities, next webinars and so on, you can join to our group, the permanent group. This is free. you don't have to pay anything, and Arthur will post later on a form to sign up. So, as I said, you can decide the type of Engagement that you want. 
You can just sign up just to remain updated on activities that we do, or if you want to be more actively engage, you can also do that and indicate it to us. The idea, though the main idea of this group, is to try to coordinate efforts in this domain, so if you are a researcher or if you are a petitioner that is interested in the main fires, feel free to reach out and join the group. 
As I said, it's free. You don't commit to anything, so it's just an X opportunity to receive relevant information on the topic. For about today, after the short introduction that I do, we will have the presentation from Hannah. and this is planned to last about 40 45 minutes, and we will also have the opportunity afterwards to ask Hannah questions or comments. So what I ask you to do? 
You can write comments in the chat also during the presentation if you want, and we will take them all these comments and questions at the end, or at the end I will also moderate other questions. So once we will finish the presentation, you can basically raise your hand or type in the chat and I will call you in. 
This of course depends on how many questions we get, but I will try to moderate in the hope that we managed to cover all questions that we received. So now it's time to introduce Hannah, and I just have a short video for Hannah. Hannah he's an assistant professor in the department of architecture engineering at. 
The Czech Technical University in Prague, CTU and Czech Republic, and she specializes in a vacation Dynamics and behavior of preschool children and air are also interesting to human being: fire design and Analysis of vacation experiments and a vacation modeling. So we are really excited to have you here, Hannah, today, talking about your research on preschool children evacuation. 
So I think it's time to leave the floor to you, so you can share your presentation and we look forward to hear about your research. 


Presentation by Dr. Hana Najmanov√°

Hi everyone, Enrico, for the introduction and also for the invitation to have a talk in this very interesting webinar series, and now I will try to share my screen with you. So can you can see my presentation. Can you see the president? Oh good, all good, yeah. So let's start. 
Evacuation Dynamics and behaviors of children appears to be a very actual. and Hot Topic for a whole field of evacuation and pedestrian Dynamics and young children or people who are to a large extent dependent on assistance provided by others and whose decision making and self rescue capabilities in emergencies may be limited. We sometimes also talk about at risk populations. 
In this context, and for starters, I would like to point out that childhood covers a large developments pen in human life. Very simply, we can say that childhood starts with the birth and it ends sometimes when we grow up into adulthood. However, we can find different opinions when childhood really ends, and many psychologists consider dah when the adolescence arises to be the end. But some consider adolescent to be only an extension of childhood. 
So we can see childhood to be divided into three basic stages, or maybe more often into four stages by scholars in order. to describe the main developmental differences, and this is very important also for understanding children evacuation behaviors, and it's important that we cannot generalize the labeled children and we should be quite precise at what age of children we actually consider. 
In this presentation I will focus on children in the early childhood stage from three to basically six years of age, sometimes also called as preschool children or preschool children age, and the presentation will be also particularly about preschool children evacuation under very low adult to child ratios that occur usually in early childhood educational institutions such as Nursery schools or day care centers, kindergartens. 
There is various terminology used for such educational programs across different countries and when we look at a diagram describing the enrollment rights of preschool children in Early Educational institutions in different European countries, their enrollment may be very close to a 100. person in some cases, and in these facilities preschool children are the majority and spend a significant amount of time there, which leads also to very specific and challenging evacuation conditions. 
I would like to talk about the main specifics of this population to be considered in human behavior, in fire studies and in fire safety and evacuation design as well. First I will present some key developmental aspects that are important for understanding of children's evacuation abilities and specifics, and then we will talk about our current knowledge and existing research than in this field. 
I would like particularly introduce an experimental study done at CTU as a part of my PhD research. And finally, at the end we can discuss some challenges that preschool children evacuation May pose for experimental research and evacuation and degrees modeling, and maybe also for other applications in fire engineering. So let's start. 
With some key aspects related to child development which can help us to look into the differences in adults and children's behaviors, thinking and movement abilities, and researchers commonly distinguish the four major domains: the cognitive and the effective motor and physical domain. In the real world, these domains are not discrete, but they continuously influence each other and create the most complex system. 
In general, children grow and progress at a very rapid Pace across all domains during the Early Childhood period. Each child for sure develops individually on its own pace. However, some general patterns and common characteristics can be determined. Children typically start to walk without support around one year of age and then they become more experienced gradually as they grow. 
However, researchers are divided when children achieve a gate pattern which looks like adults walking gait pattern because stride Dynamics may not be matured before. four to seven years of age and just curious developmental potential to acquire nature run occurs around six years of age. When we look on movement on Stars, children go upstairs without the help of adults around two years of age. Even later downstairs. 
However, they usually follow a marking time pattern that means they don't alter fit on steps and also use handrails for support and the change from marking time per turn to fit. Alternation can be observed between three or four years of age, but for children the use of handrails or other supports may be needed even longer. As children age, they acquire the ability to think, reason and learn and they gain new skills and experience. 
However, in the preschool age period, children's cognitive development, their thinking, differs most from that of older children and adults, and we can assume that preschool children do not. yet understand concrete logic and they are not fully capable to mentally manipulate information, because also their own perspective to see the world. 
That's also called ecocentrism causes their partial incapability to recognize that other people do not share the same point of view, and this all may result in their limited self rescue capabilities and also abilities to properly evaluate emergency situations. Children also continuously learn how to be a part of society and how to interact with others around them. 
After parents, teachers take usually the role of attachment figures and they represent for children providers of emotional security and Authority, which is important for evacuation and emergency situations. And finally, there are differences in physical dimensions between children and adults that are usually discussed when children evacuation Dynamics is further considered and physical craft of children in the same age group can very significantly due to individual. 
Rights of physical maturation, but we can find General patterns which are common in human and that can be represented by growth charts. The World Health Organization provides some child growth standards that are commonly adopted and recommended for international use. We can read in these charts that the mean value for body height is around 95 centimeters for three year old child and around 110 centimeters for a six year old child. 
And but here is very important to say that besides you, the large interpersonal variants, there are also other factors that affect growth development of children, such as anthropological and cultural backgrounds, for example. I put also some grow charts which are representing for Czech children population and that are based on anthropological surveys, and this curse fully correspond with the statistical data on a human average high across the world, which ranked Czech populations among the. 
Tallest populations worldwide. So you can see that there are differences in children and populations, growth and development around the world. Maybe these pictures can help us to understand the growth differences between preschool children and adults. 
For Corporation, the step rise of 22 centimeters represent represents 25 percent of the leg lengths for adults, but this is almost 45 percent of Lakeland for three year old child, and this is quite a huge difference, and it's interesting that researchers have found that children at this age are capable to plan their steps down with the same sensitivity as adults, but only in the case that the ratio between step Riser and their leg lens is the same, in other words than the usual performance when children struggle to step down should be not attributed to their limited visual motor skills, but rather to the demanding Stars geometry they have. 
To face with, similarly to body high. Also, other body dimensions should be adequately considered when preschool children are assessed in pedestrian movement calculations and flow calculations, especially when we can deal with different units of density. The commonly used expression of density employs number of people per meter square, and this can be quite misleading when we evaluate density conditions for people with different body dimensions. 
Such children and for this case the concept of occupied area introduced by teaching ski malinski seems to be a bit more appropriate, because it allows us to consider different body dimensions of people and density is expressed here in units meter Square parameter Square, and for this approach, information on area occupied by people is essential. Researchers usually use horizontal projection of human body described as an ellipse defined by shoulder width and chest breath. 
Just that sorry, and in this picture. we can see horizontal projections for adults in some address and a range of values is presented by protecting skin malinsky for the category for the category children, unfortunately without the specification of age. For more specific examples, we can look. 
We can look at this table where I put some more detail information which is available for Czech children populations, because we have detailed body measurements available thanks to extensive anthropological surveys conducted every 10 years since 50s in the Czech Republic, and in the table you can see data for shoulder width and chess circumference where used for estimating the variable of just depth and consequently also for occupied area for children in different age groups and age ranges, and we can see that the values of a horizontal projection are around a quarter meter, and here again we must keep in mind that the impact of anthropological. 
And cultural background is very important when we would like to generalize such findings. Now I will slowly move to the existing research on previous cultural evacuation which has been done and which has been increasing, especially in the last decade, and empirical data or movement characteristics and evacuation behaviors. 
They're usually collected in a field evacuation experiments, mostly in fire drills, exceptionally also in non emergency observations and controlled field experiments, Maybe, and to date research studies in this field have presented several consistent findings that highlight the importance of two factors: attitudes and approaches taken by responsible adults and the age of children. 
I will point out online some examples of the existing filings related to these factors: first reaction decisions, actions and preparedness of responsible adults, usually staff members in the institutions, influence to a large extent evacuation procedures and efficiency during evacuation, as well as movement. behaviors of children and second assistance required by children during evacuation is age dependent and just like their movement behaviors and movement abilities. 
Differences in movement patterns and abilities and differences in actual developmental levels can be more obvious on staircases. That can be generally assumed as the most challenging part of evacuation routes for preschool children. Regarding the issue of prescription evacuation, we can found many interesting works and Publications in the field of evacuation Dynamics and safety signs. 
I put some of them on this list to be maybe a nice sources for some of you for the information and details. But in the following slides, I would like to present an experimental study conducted as a part of my PhD research at CTU that included 15 evacuation drills in 10 Nursery schools with around 1 000 participants. The table you can see summarizes the number of participating. 
Children who were observed according to their age groups and labeled here as a junior, senior plus and a mixed children groups. The drills were performed in alignment standard fire regulations and procedures in the nursery schools without any intervention, just video recorded for subsequent analysis. Special Care roles given to ethical considerations and the level of announcement of the drills follow the wishes of the director of each nursery school, so different types of evacuation drills could occur. 
They could be announced, partially announced or unannounced to the participants in advance. Observations were made in whole buildings, that's in classrooms, on all parts of evacuation routes and also in exits and for food analysis. We determine so called measurement areas in experimental plans in advance and in total 100 measurement areas were set up in corridors, on staircases, separately on flights and landings and also in doorways in this. 
Study we focused on three main areas of evacuation processes which were observed and analyzed: evacuation behaviors and then also movement characteristics on different parts of Escape Routes, and then specific of evacuation procedures observed during the drills and evacuation behaviors of both children and staff members their Tech, both in the pre movement phase and the movement phase of the evacuation processes, and a number of variables that are observed, including different levels of assistance provided to Children, the reactions of children to different alarms, strategies taken when children their living classrooms, group formations and also various movement patterns on staircases and when we talk about movement characteristics, their they were observed on all parts of Escape Routes in the measurement areas I mentioned before and here travel speed specifics flows and their relationships to densities that are studied for all age groups of children from a large amount. 
Of data and observations we actually collected. I have selected only several key findings on evacuation behaviors and movement characteristics I find interesting to be to be shared here with you. During the evacuation drills, children required both wearable and physical help that was provided by responsible stuff to them. And for quantification of this aspect, we determine the following five categories. You can also see as a pictograms in this in this picture. First, no physical assistance. 
This is the first picture and First Column in the table occurred most frequently in both pre movement and movement phase during the evacuation drills. Then we have here the category gentle pushing that included physical contacts between children and adults, but physical contacts that were not necessary to proceed the evacuation, such as gentle pushing on children's heads or backs, and special categories were established for the situations when physical contact. 
Was necessary to proceed evacuation processes, and this is the this is the picture in the middle here, the third column, and there were also situations when adults hold children's hand and also when adults carried children. Some of some kind of physical help was provided to 25 percent of the participating children during the pre movement phase and to a 10 percent of children traveling through the building. 
Then we identified the principles of the affiliation model and roller rule model. During. The observed evacuation drains, children tended to follow memorized daily activities and to familiar exits and Escape Routes, and under the other hand, staff members acted according to their social roles of teachers and responsible adults, and they usually provided emotionally security to the children. 
It is also good to mention that evacuation behaviors of all participants, including hand holding and living strategies, group formation and using. Of handrails and so on was strongly influenced by the instructions given by staff members and also by daily routines, rules and educational practices employed in a particular Nursery schools, and this finding even more emphasize the importance of including and respecting the cultural background that can have a significant impact on evacuation procedures and also on behaviors of children during evacuation. 
Considering movement characteristics of children which were observed in the study, I will briefly mention only three key findings: first, as partially expected children's Traverse speeds, their dependent on the age of children and also on actual density conditions. 
Then higher travel speeds that are observed on horizontal parts of evacuation routes, in corridors, Landings and indoor weights, and then on vertical Parts, such Stars, and when we compare different horizontal parts, then higher travel speeds were observed in corridors than on Landings and in doorways and this. is also important to mention here that, except for doorways on, the low density conditions occurred during. The observed evacuation experience. 
In this graph I will show you the relationships between triple speeds and densities, and here you can see the results observed for children under four years of age, also called Junior children. 
In this study that were observed during the evacuation drills in corridors and left, we have the results for walking children and right for running Junior children, and when we can compare these results with the values measured for children over four years, it means senior and Senior plus children, and then we can see that all the children reach higher speeds, both walking and running in the same measurement areas. 
Especially High Terror speeds can be seen in senior plus children when they were running in corridors, and these results show a clear example of. how the movement characteristics of children can differ even in preschool age period, and this suggests that this aspect should be also carefully considered in evacuation design. This graph shows us the other side link I mentioned before. 
This is a comparison of the results obtained for all children, regardless of age, on different parts of the evacuation routes observed, and we can separate the look at the travel speeds measured in corridors, on lendings and in doorways, and when we compare these data sets for horizontal roots with the results measured on flights, and then we can see that the lowest values were obtained on a vertical evacuation routes, and therefore we can highlight the need for Relevant use of experimental data measured under various boundary conditions, such as types of evacuation routes and surfaces. 
Finally, I also included some of the findings from this study I talked about. a bit before, but here in the form of Behavioral statements. The idea of Behavioral statements follows the original concept, which was already introduced in the literature and which appears as a very useful tool: how to represent and use our scientific knowledge on human behavior in fire, in evacuation modeling and other applications as well, and behavioral statements can help us to understand the specifics of preschool children evacuation and movement when it should be Quantified, for example in determining of pre movement times or movement characteristics, usage of evacuation routes and Behavioral itineraries. 
However, we know that understanding and quantification of evacuation behavior of people is very challenging task, and this move us slowly to the final part of this webinar that deals that for the challenges that the specifics of preschool children evacuation can pose, for example in Ingress and evacuation modeling and the question may be. if we even can effectively simulate children's behavior and existing evacuation models, and this of course largely depends on the characteristics of each model. 
There is quite large Variety in the models that offer various modeling approaches and tools, so it will be maybe better to transform the question into what capabilities should a model have to allow us simulate preschool children evacuation? 
And first we can mention that the model user should be able to include input data that can reflect various physical dimensions of Agents or groups of agents in the crowd, some of the parameters that can be manipulate by the user, maybe usually with and high of the agents, but there are also other individual parameters available in some models that can help to better simulate child and Dynamics, such as comfort distances or boundary layers of Agents, and our observations shown that close physical. 
Contact with each other, such as touching and pushing, was typical for preschool children when they were moving in a compact flow and, moreover, under higher densities, children formed very often quite compact crowds with minimum body buffer zones. 
Then also movement characteristics, such as traveling speeds and flows should be assessed individually for children agents and ideally with respect to different types of Escape Routes, such as horizontal and vertical Escape Routes, as we talk about it a bit earlier. Very interesting is the matter of speed density relations and reductions of maximum speed of Agents simulated in the model, which is usually based on the sfpe curves and maybe on observation of adult populations. 
But such relations are also very specific for children. In some models, Advanced simulation of evacuation Behavior can be addressed through behavioral itineraries, special tasks assigned to agents in a model that can be. 
A very useful to capture in more detail some convinces typical for preschool children evacuation, for example stop and go movements or waiting phases when children have to wait at specific points that can be simulated in the models, and also some ratings for instructions or stops made because of waiting for unlocking doors and so on. They are quite wide range of specifics when preschool children are involved. 
On the other hand, we can identify some behavioral and movement patterns that are also very important for description of children evacuation Dynamics, but appropriate tools remind quite Limited in current models. 
Examples for such limitations may be movement in specific formations, Pairs and compact groups, then also restrictions of overtaking of individuals and restriction of merging of different groups on evacuation routes, and finally also the leader follower of phenomena that is partially getting increasing scientific attention in last years. however, it's integration in the most models available is actually still missing or quite Limited. What can we further assume? 
It's a key issue when we talk about responsible modeling of children evacuation is also the scarcity of relevant data that can be used as inputs into the models, and in other words, we would need more experimental data sets which would be Irrelevant for modeling and also calibration and validation purposes, and which would included the full research background and comprehensive interpretation of potential limitations for the applications of data. 
In this context, it is also Worth to mention some challenges that can be related to experimental evacuation research that involves very school children participants first of all, among other populations, children represent a very sensitive and vulnerable part of our society. Hence we should give Extra Care to ethical considerations, taking in all experiments and observations with preschool. 
Children participants and we need also accept that some of the measures for ensuring comfort and well being of children in the research May sometimes narrow or even limit sometimes of experimental methods we would like to employ to study the evacuation processes and dynamics of children, and here I borrow a nice chart by Milad hakani that demonstrates different types of both experimental and field empirical methods used in pedestrian crowd and evacuation Dynamics research to understand evacuation behavior of people and among all empirical Metals, laboratory crowd experiments are usually the most popular ones. 
Considering preschool children. Such experimental methods and tile a couple of challenges that maybe include, for example, logistic, timeline, organization and motivation constraints which can occur and despite children acquire the ability to sustain attention as they grow. Preschool children have a still very short attention spans when they can concentrate on single activity. 
And they can quickly lose interest and they intuitively jump to other activities they are more interested in, and some Scholars mention time intervals around 10 or 15 minutes. Preschool children are able to concentrate on single activity, so field and experimental methods set in children's oven and well known environments appear maybe more preferable, despite they include other limitations, for example in replicability or control over variation, and this will be very inspiring to hear some your opinions in for the discussion on this topic later, because I think there are quite a lot of questions included. 
The last point I would like to talk about here are some specifics in variables we can be interested in when we consider children evacuation processes. Beside conventional variables we are used to seeing in various evacuation studies. They can be also other interesting variables related to special evacuation procedures we can. 
Observe in early childhood educational institutions during evacuation drills mostly, and that are related to higher level of organization and also supervision of the moving flow and, for example, it's a very interesting to observe various levels of assistant required by children, instruction provided by staff or living strategies when exiting classrooms or impact of different positions of responsible stuff in groups and the strategies how they organize the children flow, and I believe they are more very specific aspects that we can explore in this matter. 
Now I see that my time is almost over. That's that's not bad because it displays. I would like to slowly finish my presentation and in the last slide I prepared only to take home messages or questions for you. I would like to Summer a summer up that and point out that understanding of evacuation behaviors and dynamics of preschool children. 
Is a very complex issue and what we usually do is in a very simplified way, VIA link children's evacuation behaviors, movement abilities and patterns to their age. And this is related closely to the first of my open take home message that it's what age intervals can be or should be considered in fire safe, the science and give a question design to be sufficiently detailed to cover specifics of different age intervals in childhood and even in the preschool childhood period. 
And the other question which I put here is a final point of the webinar, is if we can, with the current level of knowledge, we have to integrate the element of preschool children evacuation into fire evacuation design and modeling, and if there are any limitations which we must consider so this. This was already the last point of my presentation. 


Open discussion

I would like to thank. 
You very much for listening and I hope we can discuss together some interesting points. Yes, you, yes, we have already a lot of questions in the chat and thanks first of all for your very interesting presentation. I will try to cover as many questions as we have given the limited time. 
The first question is from Glenn Hamilton, and Glenn is asking about your knowledge, if you know, of any building codes in Europe or somewhere else that acknowledge the specific characteristics of this occupants group. So because we, as we heard from you, there are many specifics to take into account when designing a vacation. So are you aware of any building courses specifically looking to preschool children or not? 
To be honest, I don't know about any International standards which would touch this specific matter. Anyway, as I know, in Tech standards we have some. requirements for the occupancies where children usually occur as a majority, and also I know there are other fire codes, perspective fire codes, which sometimes demand some requirements in such facilities, but in general way any standard which would include the behavioral specifics of children population. 
I think it's currently not available for us. Yeah, yeah, thanks Hannah for this comment. Another question from Christina Meyer, so looking she's asking about the ratio between others and children and how this affect the outcome. So basically, for instance, what was the ratio that you had between children and adults in your vacation deals and what are your comments in general about this ratio between how many teachers you have and children? 
And it's a very good point, I would say, because the stuff to challenge ratio is the key factor which influences evacuation efficiency in this facilities we are looking. at and particularly in the study I presented, we observe different stuff to child ratios, because the study involved a large variety of Nursery schools and subjects. So we had their Nursery schools with only one class, one class Nursery schools but also large institutions with more than 10 classes. 
So the stuff to chat ratio we actually observed a very significantly. But if I remember well, the mean value of stuff to chart ratio we had in our experimental study was about 1 to 10. So one adult available for 10 children. 
And I must say that this is also a huge questions, not only in federal safety design but also in educational programs and normal, normal situations in Nursery schools, because usually there is very low stuff to child ratio and it can happen that there is even only one adult responsible adult for 20 children, for example. 
Because in Nursery schools they are quite special requirements and situations may occur that teachers are changing there, because maybe sometimes in the morning hours there is only one teacher available, for example, four hours of the day, and then in the middle of the day they can be of two or three there, but again in the afternoon there is also the situation that only one responsible staff is here present, and this is this is quite dangerous, I would say, because children require assistance, not only physical but also wearable assistance, and they need to have a feeling of security, that they have to know that someone is there to be to take care of them and hire staff to child. 
Ratios are dangerous and we have a lot of questions and you know we're already over time, so I will just pick some macro themes, both Gerta. Custer and army seifried. They ask questions about modeling, so the main question is: how will you deal with this from a computer modeling perspective? So if you would like to design a model from, would you think of Designing a model from scratch? 
Or can you alter existing models for adults, both of what concerns movement but also pre movement phase? When it comes to comment from farming, it's also it's also very good point. I have already made some tries and ideas about specific evacuation modelings of this population and I would say that alternating existing models is a way. 
I don't think there is a necessary need to develop new models from the start, but we have to consider some aspects and features that the model would need to appropriately simulate some behavioral sequences and patterns, as I mentioned in the presentation. We need a feature which. 
Would cover different grouping in the crowd and also a movement in Paris which is, I think, missing in the current models and on the other hand, which is very important for a very organized level of evacuation we observe in Nursery schools and early childhood institutions in general. I take two quick last comments. One is from Erica ethical challenges, and I mean, do you have any specific advice about the ethics approval process? 
Because I mean we you are filming children, so that's a tricky one right. Yeah, I would say this is maybe the biggest challenge to consider all appropriate ethical considerations they are needed for such experimental studies involving children. And maybe very short advice is start to plan and start to communicate in a very early phase of the research and communication with parents.communication with the institutions, with teachers and directors, is essential. Yes. one last question. 
There was a comment from Russia you did about the availability of special code. So this is more also an interesting answers for the comment that was from Glenn Hamilton. But there is one last question that is about gender. How have you got the chance to look into this? How gender affects speeds at different ages, because there may be different growth patterns depending on gender as well. It's also very good point. 
Actually, I didn't look particularly on the impact of gender, but we can. We can say that this is not so much important in this developmental stage of children, because they are for sure some differences in growth pattern. But when we look at the variance in interpersonal developmental stages and the pace of development for various children in the same age group, then we can say that some differences in gender. 
Maybe the minority and they don't have such huge impact I would on some behavioral patterns or movement abilities. Thanks, Hannah, I think we're already running over time, so I want to thank you again for answering the questions and to everyone that has attended. I'm always glad to see interest on our webinar series. 
As you can see, Arthur has posted again the links to our to sign up to our mailing list and also to our official webinar Channel on YouTube. So I thank you one more time, Hannah, for your interesting contribution and I thank everyone else and stay tuned for our next event. Thanks, everyone bye, thank you.
