 Hello everybody, my name is Wojciech Węgrzyński, I'm a professor at the Building Research Institute ITB in Poland and today I'm going to learn what happens when you cross wildfire with a Cervezo industrial facility of high risk. This is a topic that would not immediately come to my mind. I have never thought about merging industrial fire protection and wildfires. To me, these two sub-disciplines are pretty far away from each other. But luckily, my guest, Professor Eulalia Planas from Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya, she has been running two groups that were doing those subjects. And in a nice way, she's combined our powers to create a group or a research task that focuses on wildland industrial interface, WII. And yeah, it's quite a fascinating world where risk analysis meets fire brands and all the hazards that normally come from the wildfires. We've probably heard a lot about the wildfire urban interface. So the problem is kind of similar, just the consequences are a bit different. Because we are talking here about high-risk industrial facilities, and it's not just the fact that they can be damaged and there can be loss because those are very expensive installations. It's also that they carry a lot of materials, lots of substances, a lot of potential impacts that can domino from a wildfire and create a significantly bigger catastrophical outcome if that facility is severely damaged by a wildfire. Not to mention the monetary loss or the life loss or, in general general the loss related to such an event. In this episode, we discuss how industrial facilities are endangered by wildfires. What can we do to protect them? What can we do to actually assess the risk and investigate if those facilities need special protection? What to pay attention for and what mechanisms to look up? So yeah, please join me in welcoming Professor Ulalia Planes. Let's spin the intro and learn something about wildland industrial interface. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Its globally established team has developed a reputation for preeminent fire engineering expertise, with colleagues working across the world to help protect people, property, and environment.

Hello, everybody. I'm here today with Professor Lolia Planas from Poltechnica in Catalunya. Hello, Lolia. Good to see you. Hello, Wojciech. Thanks for inviting me. Happy to be here. Welcome back to the Fire Science Show. I hope IMFSE is doing great in Catalonia. But here today, we're going to talk about your research. And your group has been very well doing in the industrial and risk management fire safety, let's say. And I know there was a group doing wildfires. And then something interesting happened between those groups. And I'm not sure if you coined the term, but I definitely heard it first from you. You started working on something called Wildland Industrial Interface, WII. I'm not sure if that's easier or harder than WUI. You guys need to work on your shortcuts. But anyway, tell me, like, how did Wildland Industrial Interface research area happen at all? Yeah, well, the thing is that our research group have been working in doing research to improve risk assessment and process safety in industrial installations. Basically focused on chemical and petrochemical industries. And then for some years, we have been also working in the field of wildland fires, wildfire behavior, wildfire analysis and monitoring, and also in the wildland-urban interface. So it's when looking at what happens in the wildland-urban interface. So how fires, wildfires can damage and can affect really urban settlements when you realize that within urban settlements, we also have industries and industries that deal and process substances that are hazardous and that can, if affected, can cause further damage, can cause accidents that also can be very, very dangerous for the population, also for the environment and for the economy itself. So that's why we started to look at the problem of the wildland industrial interface to analyze a little bit this problem. So perhaps I'm using bad words, but we are kind of considering like the petrochemical plant as kind of a bomb, you know, like environmental bomb. If it all goes wrong, it can go very wrong. And the wildfire hazard, there's some sort of a trigger to that. How does the challenge of a fire from wildlands, coming from the wildland urban interface into the plant, differentiate from your normal hazards you would consider while developing fire safety in like a petrochemical industry? Is it a different challenge? Yeah, I think it's not a very, very significant different challenge, but it has many differences that have to be taken into account. Well, first is that process engineers or safety engineers working in those kind of industrial installations do not usually do not know anything about wildfires and what it implies. So this is the first important thing. Then, of course, when we analyze risk in a chemical plant, well, this has been going on for many, many years. Currently, we have, in general, very safe plants. We have laws and standards that ensure that our chemical plants work properly and with a high level of safety. But then in those kind of studies, what we usually take into account is the potential or probability of failure of equipment for different reasons that can give rise or can originate an eventual release, loss of containment of dangerous substance. And then we analyze what happens if this release takes place. If the substance is toxic, that can give rise to a toxic cloud that can affect the population. What happens if the substance is flammable? Then you can have an explosion or a fire, different types of fires, poor fires or dead fires, etc. But usually when you do that in a normal way, it's just one event that you consider at the same time. Okay. Of course, you consider all the events that potentially can take place and you take measures to avoid that. So you apply safety barriers to avoid those accidents to happen. When there is a wildfire, we need to rethink a little bit all of that. And in fact, so first thing, a wildfire is a natural event that can have an impact to an industrial installation. can have an impact to an industrial installation. This type of events, it's something what we call natick events, natural events that impact technological, let's say, industries. And this has been studied for many years, let's say, because it's not something new. We already know that floods, earthquakes, other types of natural events can have an impact in industrial installations and generate accidents. And this has happened also in the past in many countries around the world. We are seeing now an increase due to climate change in the number of natick events occurring. So natick events have already been studied, mostly in the field of floods, earthquakes, because are, let's say, larger phenomena that affect extended surfaces. I think a very brutal example would be Fukushima nuclear power plant after a tsunami. And it was kind of built in a wayushima nuclear power plant after a tsunami. Yeah, exactly. And it was kind of built in a way that was protecting itself against a tsunami. They just didn't, or perhaps they expected, but they were okay with the risk that it's like, it has to be like one in a thousand year tsunami to reach that far. And then multiple cascading things led to one to another, where perhaps if it was just, I'm now hypothesizing, I to another where perhaps if it was just, I'm now hypothesizing, I don't have a very intimate knowledge of this event, but I would assume that if a failure happened like one reactor or one part of the plant, they would have stuff put in place to stop propagation of this catastrophe. But when it happens to every single building at the very single time, suddenly the measures that are meant to isolate the thing are not working. From my limited professional education in the process safety as a fire safety engineer, we had a course on industrial fire protection. The thing we were looking at is propagation. Like you cannot prevent every single incident in your plant, but you must make sure that the events do not propagate between parts of the facility. So if there is a tank on fire, you have this big bath that you capture all the oil so it doesn't spill around in a very simple means. But this isolates you from something coming from inside. Here, if you suddenly have a fire triggered in multiple places, those new vulnerabilities appear. It's suddenly a completely different hazard. And I think in here you're shifting the entire paradigm of how do we protect the power plant, because here suddenly, in this setting, what we've been doing post-Cervezo, like, you know, in the entire world of Process City, it may not be enough. I wonder, like, how easy it in the entire world of process, it may not be enough. I wonder, like, how easy it is for fire to spread into the facility. Because I also don't think we build, like, plants in the middle of forests, right? Actually, my laboratory is built in the middle of forests, but that's not what normal people would do. Yeah. Well, two things. First, we are thinking, first, of course, to type of Seveso installation. First, we are thinking first, of course, to type of service or installation service or plans are those that are under regulation of the of the service directive, which means that they handle the hazardous substances in large amounts, let's say. But we should not forget that there are many, many industrial installations that also handle hazardous substances in lesser amounts, which are not under the Cerezo directive. But if fire reaches those installations, we will also have a problem. Okay, so I think we need to be aware in the case of wildfire, not only on Cerezo plants, but also on those other, let's say, no such large plants, but that are spread everywhere. This is the first thing. Then looking at Cveso plants, of course, in general, and this applies also to other type of industrial installations, in general, we think that industrial sites are quite far from the forest or from vegetated areas. And that's partly true, not completely true, because if you look at the map, you can see many in the middle of the forest, but it's not the common thing. Usually they are in industrial areas with other industries and with, let's say, a separated or a fringe of land free of vegetation or with a lower amount of vegetation, which somehow protect them. I think that something that usually comes to mind when thinking about, OK, there is a wildfire and this can threat my installation. You are thinking on the fire front reaching your plant, which is the flames and the heat radiation reaching your plant. The wall of fire. Arriving there. And then you look at the distance and you say, no, no, that's not possible. Or it's very low probability or it would be quite far. Radiation will not reach high levels when arriving near the plant. But wildfires do not have only these impacts, which are, let's say, direct impingement of the flames or the heat radiation. There are two other impacts linked to wildfires, which is ember attack, rain of embers, flying, glowing embers, and the fire environment itself. And when I say fire environment, I mean smoke, obscuration, low visibility, high temperatures in general, and strong winds. temperatures in general and strong winds. And I think that these two, let's say, impacts, fire attack and ember attack and the fire environment, in case of industrial installations, is something we need to think about more than the impact of the fire fronts reaching the installation in general. So in other words, you don't have to have your facility in the middle of the forest to be actually vulnerable to what's happening during a wildfire event. Exactly. You can have your forest, of course, you need to be near a forest somehow, but not, let's say, to have the forest at 100 meters apart. So the forest can be 500 meters, 1 kilometer, even up to 5 kilometers, because firebrands can travel long distances. Of course, if you have the forest more close, then the probability of having more firebrands and also the fire itself reaching the installation is higher. I am to some extent familiar with the firebrand ignition of houses. And I know the work of IBHS, your new postdoc, Simona, who was in my office. She was studying the firebrand ignition of houses so i i got some basic understanding like a firebrand accumulation problem and what it takes but when i see you know a house i see you know a wooden structure you know bushes around it some nice architectural features which would be made out of timber i I see a lot of vulnerabilities. When I think about land, I see like a brick and mortar building or a steel rectangle, which doesn't look that much flammable. Okay, you have things like tanks, which probably would be the most vulnerable. And I know you also have papers on that. So how is it, how actually easy it is or how hard it is to actually cause a fire in a storage tank? Like, is it actually possible that wildfire creates that? So if we are thinking about a storage tank, a closed storage tank, I wouldn't say there is a large probability they are quite safe. I mean, are made of steel, but they are, for instance, floating roof tanks, typically used with flammable liquids stored at ambient temperature. goes with the liquid level. And this is to release, because they are, let's say, they have a high volatility, so they release vapors quite easily. So that way, you minimize the release of vapors, flammable vapors. But still, there is that rim, which somehow is releasing a little bit of flammable vapors. is releasing a little bit of flammable vapors. And what happens if you start having fire ants arriving there? Then these flammable vapors can ignite, and then you have the ignition of the contents of your tank. That's a possible situation, very possible situation. Another thing is that in many plants, they have like what we call attics zones. Zones in you already know you may have flammable atmospheres. You cannot avoid them. Then of course in a normal situation for a plant, these areas that are well identified and are well known are protected with different means. Also, they avoid all kinds of ignition sources in those areas. But what happens if you have a wildfire near the plant? Then you cannot avoid having ignition sources that are coming from the sky and landing in your plant. So that's another situation. Now we are thinking like in the big installations and things like that, but then many, many plants, they have little storage, usually on the borders of the plant with smaller, let's say, tanks or storage units, sometimes made of plastic. That's something you are not thinking about too much because it's not your dangerous or the most dangerous equipment in your plan. But then this can be the starting point of a biggest fire in your plant. So this is some example. It's even some sort of a strategy to create safety by, you know, splitting your whatever you're containing into smaller containers, you know, and spread them around. So you don't have one massive tank with 10,000 cubic meters of something. You split it into smaller tanks. And those storages can be outdoors because the point of those tanks is that they're protected from weather because they're plastic. So definitely there's a buildup of flammable and perhaps dangerous material inside of them. And what you said about ATEX zones, yeah, that's the main strategy to remove the ignition sources. Like we spend unimaginable amount of money on uh you know atex certified equipment valves and everything because they are supposed to not create any sort of ignition source and then you are in under a shower of firebrands i i think one another element perhaps uh not something that sets your entire plant on fire and destroys it, but those are interconnected installations. Like if I think about the large petrochemical facility, and I had the chance to visit the biggest one in Poland when I was a student, the thing that struck me is those thousands of kilometers of pipes and cables. It's an unimaginable array of connection between all of those facilities. Yes, the facilities are far away from each other, but the interconnection between them, the blood network of the plant is insane. And this is because those are interconnected processes. If you take one out, the entire process stops. So there is like a risk to continuity of the operations of the plant, even from a small fire. Even if you hit one valve, it can potentially affect the plant. Have you tried to estimate like when should the factory stop its operation when the wildfire is approaching? Because a small fire can take out the process. Yeah, that's key. Of course, usually when there is a wildfire, the first thing that this kind of plan should do is shut down the plan. But this is something that is not just pushing a button. Sometimes shutting down a plan requires a lot, a lot of time. So you need to think about it before to plan it, to say, OK, if there is a wildfire, when should I start the procedure to shoot down the plant? Because at the end, if you have not done this exercise, then everything comes rushing. If you have not done this exercise, then everything comes rushing. And that process of shutting down plants are also one of the most dangerous moments in a plant when accidents can actually happen too. So this is something you need to start about that too, is up to now we have been thinking on the direct impact of the wildfire on equipment that can then fail. If an equipment fails, you can have an accident, another fire, an explosion, and this has a cascading effect, what we call a domino effect that can affect other equipment. what we call a domino effect that can affect other equipment. But what has been seen in natick events, in other type of natick events, is that not often, it's not only the natural event impacts directly the equipment. So that situation of can fail, a big tank can fail because of the wildfire. Well, that's very low probability because it's protected in many ways, because it's made of steel, because many, many different reasons. What usually happens in inatic events is that what fails is the auxiliary systems or the planned utilities that fail first. And then this carries other consequences for your equipment. Or safety barriers fail. For instance, what happens? All your tanks usually are protected with sprinklers or a kind of system to extinguish if there is a fire. What if those systems activate without a fire because they detect the presence of fire runs or whatever, then they start releasing water to when there is no risk at that moment. But then maybe you you have spent your water before. And when you have your problem, you then you need to those resources. You don't have them. So there are many, many different types of situations that you need to think about and plan ahead. Even like the population displacement as well, because you would have like a local population working at your factory. And if those people are at least there, perhaps, you know, they will be living around the factory. Like you could think about this. Some of them will be living close to the fire some further. So you might have quite a displaced population and simply run out of people to run your factory. There's also some interaction that changes the way how the building and the factory operates. And what you just said, the auxiliary fighters, you suddenly create a new vulnerability in your facility, like perhaps something that would not be a hazard before because you had three different safety systems in place to contain that hazard. You suddenly have two of them gone, just one. And then this is a risk that is unaccepted. is unaccepted. Were there any like very big industry fires that you could originate to like wildfire origin or like WII fires that you can think of? Well just this February in Chile, I don't know if you heard that, there was quite severe wildland urban interface fire in the area of Valparaiso and Viña del Mar. There was a summer school in combustion last year in that place exactly. Well, it was beginning of this 2024 February, 2024. It was not a large wildfire in terms of hectares burned, but it was a very large wildland-urban interface. So the fire reached the city and started propagating through the urban settlement. And then it affected many, many different industrial sites and some of them causing explosions. And I don't have, because it's quite recent, that all the consequences of those explosions and things and how this exactly happened. But it's been recorded and it's been registered and it's not the only one. So the thing is that it's difficult to look at that. I've been trying to look at what has happened before during wildfires affecting industrial installations, but there is no official record of that. The statistics do not record these kind of events. And you usually need to go through the news in mass media. And that's difficult because usually they focus more if it affected the population and dwellings and buildings and houses, then you don't have the information on the industry side. But I think it's increasing. You've mentioned NATO incidents, and I guess it's something that the industry was very well aware since the beginning of the industry, actually. industry, actually, and where we're not really building plans where you can have tsunamis or floods or you're not probably more thinking about the earthquake appearances. We try to not build those very key facilities in those vulnerable places. Perhaps that's not always the case. However, forests and wildfire urban interface is probably a new threat that comes to already existing facilities. My question is, how big is the problem? How many of such facilities there are? Well, I don't have the number exactly. I know that, for instance, in the U.S., they identified type of industries located in high risk, wildfire risk areas. And they identified around 300, 350, if I remember well, out of 11,000. But in France, they also did a study of those installations. Of course, the way you define the areas at risk is different from one place to another, so it's not comparable. But in France, they have around 1,200 CPSO industries and also around 300 are in wildfire prone areas. Wow. So they identified around 25% of their Seveso sites could be affected. That means if you are in those places, you need to take that into account when analyzing the risk in your plant. That's what Sevesoil directive says. You need to look also at the external risk. But up to now, usually wildfire risk was not considered in those studies. I'm looking on your paper on mapping the areas in Europe and in Asia. And from what's in the paper, it seems that it is the wildland industrial interface represents 2.5% of European land or 6% of the wildland fuel areas. That's actually a lot. That's 15 mega hectares. I've never seen someone use mega hectares for an area. So that tells you that it's potentially quite a lot. And if I look at the map, it's disturbingly a lot in Germany and Poland and Sweden. It's kind of interesting because I also had an episode in the Fire Science show with Nieves Fernandez-Anez who was talking about the fires moving up north, you know, the new hazards emerging in places that did not really know were ready for wildfires to come. And here it's another level of this interesting dynamic that is not just settlements of people, it's not just, you know, evacuation pathways, but the bloodline of the industry, of economy, the industrial things. And I know we have big plans that will be nearby forests in Poland, Germany. Let's try and talk about how could one actually make their facility ready. In your paper, you mentioned quality of risk assessment. So perhaps we could talk about QRA and how this can help us figure out how to protect the facility against wildfires. Perhaps first you could give me an introduction to QRA. I don't think I've ever had a proper QRA episode in a fire science show. Perhaps we should do one. Well, that's not a possibility for another day. Give me a five-minute introduction and then we'll decide. Give me a five-minute introduction and then we'll decide. Yeah, well, the quantitative risk assessment in a chemical plant, let's say, involves several steps. So briefly, first we need to identify the potential hazards that can occur. And this is mostly linked to the type of substances, hazardous substances you have, let's say, then we need to quantify the, well, two things, the probability of those events occurring. Because, okay, let's say, risk assessment, what's risk? Risk, no? It's the combination of the probability of a hazardous event to happen with the potential consequences. So usually to quantify it, you need to quantify the probability of occurrence and then the consequences usually in terms of economic money that will cost. But usually we don't take into account money, but we take into account the potential number of deaths or injured people that you can cause if that accident happened. So we need to deal with those two elements of the equation. So first we need to identify the frequency with which those events can happen, and then we need to quantify the probability of having deaths due to that event to happen. So the probability usually is deal with, because there has been many, many different studies and years that this has been going on. So we already usually deal with different types of loss of containment events, standardized loss of containment events. containment events, standardized loss of containment events. For example, you have a tank with a flammable substance. Then you imagine what will happen if there is the total loss of containment. If the tank fails completely and all the content is released, what happens if there is a hole in the tank, etc.? So there are different standardized types of loss of containment events that you already know the probability of those events. And then you, by means usually of event trees, you analyze if that substance is released due to that loss of containment, what is the final accident that can happen. I can have toxic cloud or an explosion or whatever, and the event tree helps you obtaining the final probability of those accidents. And then for each one of those accidents, you need to evaluate the consequences, which means that if it's, let's say, an explosion, then you need to evaluate the overpressure generated by this explosion around and evaluate, depending on the number of population you have, then you can compute the probability of that due to that overpressure. So basically, this is what is done very quickly, but taking into account all the possible loss of containment events in your plan and all the possible final accidental scenarios. And you sum up all of these to have the overall risk that plan has. And within this type of analysis, you can also test different protection scenarios. You can test different safety routines and see what works best in reducing risk, what doesn realistic. That's why we put safety measures in place. So, of course, when you have different kinds of elements to protect your plant, you take that also into account. That will reduce, for example, the time during which the substance is being released. So the release will be with a lower amount. You will have other kind of elements that can protect you against the final consequences. And that's, of course, taken into account. In the paper, which I'll link in the show notes, of course, there's a general procedure described for wildfire industrial QRA. So I'll just reach through the steps and then perhaps we can go deeper in some of them. So first step, wildfire scenario identification and characterization. Then second, identification of the critical equipment that when affected by wildfire can lead to hazardous situations. The third step, identification of the damage modalities that wildfire can cause to critical equipment. The fourth one, wildfire hazard identification due to both direct and indirect causes. The fifth one, wildfire consequences analysis. And finally, the risk calculation. Wildfire scenarios, identification, characterization, I guess that's what's coming from the outside. So what kind of fires you can have. And that's probably an identification of what types of forests you are around is this a pine forest or this is uh another different type of forest so i guess let's let's skip that one critical equipment we we briefly talked about it but maybe you can reiterate like what would be the yeah so you skip the first part but maybe oh you want to win no no it's not that i want but i think it's one of the most important because we don't have that exactly characterized. And it's something that we need still to do research on. Because this implies two things. First, to assign a probability of having a wildfire there, if you want to quantify it. So that belongs to what we call fire regime. I didn't think about that. We may have data to obtain that. But then there is the wildfire exposure scenarios, which is what I talked to you about, heat radiation, flame contact, ember attack. But then, what about ember attack? What should we expect in terms of ember attack? How many embers? What's the concentration? So to try to then identify and see what kind of loss of containment events can happen, you need to know previously what kind of attack would you expect. So that's something that some research still need to be done. And it's something that we are currently working with Simona precisely on analyzing the potential of wildfire ember attack to industrial equipments. I very naively assume that it's already solved, but it's fire science. Nothing is solved. Exactly. And you're right. When you said frequency, it is solved. Exactly. And you're right. I didn't, like, when you said the frequency, it was immediate to me. You said risk is frequency times the consequences. So you first need to know how often the wildfire can happen to get any number out of the process, because if you don't have the first number, you cannot process anything. But let's try to go further. My intention was to focus on how can we solve it. So perhaps that was also why I went into this pathway of thinking. Let's try the critical equipment, if we can reiterate what's critical in your really be affected by these different exposure scenarios. So fire run, heat temperature, increasing strong winds, obscuration, flying embers, and things like that. And ashes, a lot of ash, too, because maybe some of your sensors are visual. So if the ash has covered them, then they don't function properly. So you need to think about that. So some storage equipment, of course, you need to look at that. Atexons, we already discussed that, but there are also other types of storage of heat-sensitive substances. So maybe you don't need the embers or just the increase in the external, in the ambient temperature that out of normal ranges, let's say, can have an impact on them. Now I think that the post-fire safety assessment of such a plant must be a hell to perform if you went through one and nothing happened, but then to make sure you can resume your operations normally, that must be hell. Anyway, next step was the damage to the critical equipment. So is this through default trees? How do you perform that? So that's the second step. So once you identify your equipment, you need to see how this can fail due to the external attack. It's a total failure of the tank or there will be what kind of loss of containment you expect. And this has to be defined somehow if you want to quantify the later consequences. But in here also, you should take into account, which is not done in a normal QRA, the disruption of the auxiliary and utility systems and also the potential disruption of the safety barriers or malfunction of the safety barriers. Or that's something that you would need to consider in that step. Nothing has been done yet. You've used a very specific wording, damage modalities, in the list. Like, what's that? Damage modalities is that. So what you expect to happen on the equipment. The modes of damage, you know. Exactly. Okay, good. Not a native speaker. You shouldn't know that either. Just kidding. Let's go further. Hazard identification due to both direct and indirect causes. So is this looking more like a normal purpose Q-ray you'd perform at the factory? Exactly. So in here you will use or you may use typical tools that are currently already used in a typical QRA, but you need to look at if they have to be applied in the same way. For instance, I talked before about, okay, once I have defined my loss of containment, then I can build an event tree to look at the final accidental scenarios. For instance, if an event tree, if it's a flammable substances, typically we have event trees in which you analyze if there is immediate ignition or not, there is a probability for that. If there is a probability for ignition depending on different kind of situations in the plant, if you have a very well protected or you avoid ignition sources, then your probability of ignition will be very low, etc. And we already have those probabilities of the MN3 well known, more or less, for classical core rays. But what happens here, maybe those probabilities we are now assigning to the different branches of the MN3, we need to rethink them when there is a wildfire, because we may not be sure that you can avoid those. So maybe the probability of ignition in that case will be one instead of 70% or 50%. I wonder how can you perform analysis of parallel events happening? Because that's not something that QRA methods would define at. And here you have two events happening in a parallel. It's not like a sum of those damages. It can be a multiplication of that. And it must create a very interesting dynamics within your plan. Like almost like you start at the middle of the domino already, not at the beginning of the domino, right? So is there any methodologies that allow you to account for this? Yeah. So currently, QRAs do not take into account the simultaneity of two scenarios happening at the same time. Because, I mean, so we take into account the domino effect. So one scenario happens and this can generate another scenario. This is taken into account. One scenario happens and this can generate another scenario. This is taken into account. But what is not currently taken into account is if two very different scenarios happen at the same time in the plant, which actually in a wildfire, in an attack event in general, this can happen. And this requires a different strategy, let's say, for considering all the probabilities, so all the probabilistic calculation, let's say, in the core rate, but then also in terms of computing the consequences of all these scenarios happening simultaneously. That's something that's not been done in the past because usually it's nothing. It's something that doesn't occur commonly. In the end of your process, there's consequence analysis that moves into risk calculation. Any differences compared to your normal QA that would come because of the wildfire hazard? Or it's just an outcome of all the previous steps that make the difference? Exactly. I think that the final risk calculation would be similar, except for the fact that you need to consider those simultaneous probabilities of different accidents happening at the same time. But this is more in the field of probabilistic science. more in the field of probabilistic science. At the end, the sum up of all the events that can happen or will compute finally or will give us the total risk of the plant. For the final part of the interview, I would like to take you out of the factory or out of the Cervezo plant for a brief while. So industry is not just, you know, those big plants, but it's also the power lines that connect, like, high amounts of electricity to them. It would be the pipelines, the oil pipelines, the gas pipelines, water, transit, whatever. It would be the communication, the roads, the trains, everything that connects all those industries together. Did you consider also vulnerability of things like that? Like what extent, for example, a wildfire can take out the power in a specific region to the point where it actually affects the factory? And in this case, factory can be 50 kilometers away. Yeah. Right? So this is not directly taken into account in a QR rate, okay? But this has to be taken into account when planning for the emergency management. So emergency plans of industrial installations should consider all these situations. And I would say this is even more important than computing or performing a QRA. Because to be able to perform a QRA properly, taking into account wildfire risk, I think we still need to do a lot of research and improve our methodologies a lot for that. But even if we don't have that, even if we don't know exactly how much the risk is increased due to the wildfire quantitatively, if we are in a situation in which we know we can be threatened by a wildfire, we need to consider that in our emergency plan. So take into account the potential failure of utilities because the power line just doesn't work anymore because it has been taken down by the wildfire or for any other reason. This is something that they usually also consider because it can happen for other reasons. but also the eventual failure of supply of some chemicals due to the pipelines that have been affected by a wildfire. All these situations have to be taken into account in the emergency plan. What will we do if a wildfire threatens the plant in some way? And plan ahead and have a protocol to how we will deal with that, just to not improvise when that happens. And I think fires like that actually happened already. Like, there was this Fort McMurray fire, which was in oil-rich areas, and I think it disturbed a lot of the old networks. That was one of the big consequences for that fire. Regarding the power lines, it's one of the big consequences for that fire. Regarding the power lines, it's actually a very interesting dynamic because to the best of my knowledge, shutting down the power lines is one of the ignition prevention methodologies used in California. We've heard about the power shutdowns that were planned because the wildfire weather is extreme. And I don't know how exactly wires set down fires on fire, but I guess there's some methodology that creates hot pieces that fall down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is definitely situations in which power lines can be the ignition of a wildfire. Power lines can be the ignition of a wildfire. That's why sometimes they shut down also the power lines to avoid more ignitions when there is a high risk of wildfires. But, yeah, well, plants, of course, they have their own auxiliary power systems, backup systems to work in those situations. So I can imagine if there is a power shutdown, they can work temporarily with their own power systems. And then if necessary, they can shut down the plant also in a proper way. in a proper way. Very fascinating thing to study. I think especially the fact that it really challenges the problem, like it's going from a single possible course of fire into considering parallel fires happening at different scales in the facility. That's a complete that's like the nightmare of of risk engineering, you know? Yes. And but but something we something we need to face. So, at the end, let's plug the European 560 Science Congress that you're organizing. So, how are the papers coming in? When we publish the episode, the due is long gone, but I hope you're getting a lot of good submissions for the conference. Yeah, so our deadline is still not meet. So we are already receiving papers and we hope we will receive a lot of more in the coming days. So we decided to extend finally the one week, the deadline, that deadline was 1st of April, but just we realized that it coincides with Eastern holidays. So we decided to just postpone for one week. So it will be finally 8th of April, the deadline. And yeah, we are expecting a lot of papers coming in. And when exactly is the conference happening and where? a lot of papers coming in. And when exactly is the conference happening and where? Yeah, the conference is happening from 9th to 11th October 2024 in Barcelona. So this will take place in the Barcelona School of Engineering, which is in the newest campus of UPC, near the sea, very beautiful area, very nice facilities. And yeah, we are very happy to welcome everyone to Barcelona. I think everyone is very happy with the choice of the location of the conference. Sounds like a great reason to visit Barcelona this October. Is it warm in October? Can you swim in the sea? Usually, yes. I mean, when I was young, October was already autumn and bad weather somehow. But now, I mean, we are having summer temperatures until November in Barcelona. So, yes. Fantastic. If it's not raining, you can go to the beach, which is nearby, and have a... No rain is going to stop me. Anyway, Ilaria, thank you very much for this interesting discussion. Thank you for touching this important subject. I have somehow a feeling the importance of this will rise a lot after the first very... I really hope we don't have a fire Cervezo, you know, wildfire Cervezo incident, but in some ways it's perhaps inevitable. The more preparedness we build up to that point, the more knowledge we build up to that point, the safer and less consequential that will be. And I'm very happy that you are working and your team is working on this before the big accident. We're always like, how couldn't you see that? How couldn't you see that coming? No, we're working on it. And hopefully it never comes. Hopefully, yeah. Great talking to you and thank you. See you around. It was a pleasure. Thank you for checking. And that's it. I hope you've enjoyed it. World of industrial fire protection, world of wildfires. I did not think you can easily connect those two worlds. It doesn't come to my mind very automatically that it's possible to join them. But Eulalia's group has actually done that, and it seems a very interesting piece of study. So many factories that are vulnerable to wildfires in some extent, you don't have to have a factory in the middle of a forest. It's enough to be in the range of firebrands or perhaps in the range of disruption of the fire itself to cause a significant damage. And as Eulalia said, it's not just an on-off button for a power plant or a petrochemical plant. It's a process that you need to plan ahead that costs a lot of money and that is very challenging to reverse, to start over the plant. So those decisions must be extremely tough. I'm really glad that our group and other groups in the world are working on this. Before we had the first major catastrophical industrial fire in the wildfires. I hope we never have that, but realistically, like summarizing the end of the episode, it's in a way inevitable. And great that we're getting prepared and studying it already. I hope it was also interesting from the perspective of simply doing QRA, all the risk analysis for plants, because methodologies for non-NATEC events will be very similar. We didn't have that much risk engineering in the fire science show, and I know in some parts of the world, it's the main thing that fire engineers do. So hopefully you have enjoyed this, and you've learned something new, or refreshed your knowledge, or at least have gained a new view on this extremely important subject. Anyway, that is it for today's episode. I am very excited because on April 11th and Thursday, actually, if you're listening this on the launch, it's kind of tomorrow, that a spin-off podcast to the Fire Science Show is about to launch. It's a project called Uncovered Witness Fire Science Revelations. And in that, we go deep into the fundamentals of fire science with multiple guests, with narrated perspectives, with multiple real-world examples of catastrophical fires, the lessons that came from them, how we've improved, how it is changing, how it is growing, where are we heading. Hopefully an interesting series. Three episodes are going up. Three episodes are going live on the launch, and the first topic that we touch is means of escape. But no, we only talk about the width of the emergency doors a little bit. Trust me, there is some sexiness and interesting stuff in the design of escape routes from a building and in general, making a building easy to escape and helping people, not stopping them from escaping for their lives. Anyway, exciting times ahead. A lot of work for me, but I love it. I'm doing it for you. I have fantastic partners like the OFR consultants for the Fire Science Show and Halal Fire Research for the Uncovered Witness that support me in my mission. And in the end, you get your content. I hope it serves you well. Thank you very much for being here and see you in the Uncovered Witness tomorrow and in the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
