 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today we're going to talk competency, but just a little about the competency of fire safety engineer, but a hell of a lot more about the competencies of other stakeholders in the process, especially architects, mechanical engineers, structural engineers, and all of those people who design buildings which we work with trying to deliver fire safety. It's an interesting topic. I brought a very interesting guest, Dr. Mike Woodrow from University College London, who specializes in education and actually shares a very interesting story how he touched the education aspect in fire safety. And now Michael is working on educating architects because of a shift in thinking that is occurring at the UK that after the Granville Inquiry will quite change the fundamentals of how architects and fire safety operate in the UK. You'll learn a lot more on that from the episode, so I won't share too much. I just want to say that if you have a friend architect, I think that could be a very interesting podcast episode for them to listen because we're discussing things that will inevitably touch them. So I hope I brought up your curiosity. If you're not an architect, keep listening because it also impacts your life as a fire engineer and of course it's more UK related. But I think the shift of thinking that's happening in the UK can come to any part of the world. And I think it actually makes a lot of sense what Michael is saying. So it may actually be not a bad idea to bring it all over the world. So, OK, enough of rambling. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wierzynski, and I will be your host.

And now let's go back to fire competent architects. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the fire science show. I'm today with Michael Woodrow from University College London. Hello, Michael. Great to have you in the show. Hi there. Great to be here. I'm very excited because today we're going to talk about competencies in FHIR and I've recently been at SFP conference in Berlin and every second talk refers to competencies in one way or another and if the talk did not then the questions from the audience did for sure. I may have some connection with the excellent keynote given by Jose in there. Anyway, it seems like a very important topic, and I truly believe it is. You've done a lot of work in this field with your PhD, but before that, tell me your professional story, because I know you transferred from the world of engineering into the world of science, and I've been looking for so long for a person that switched career this way. So tell me all about this, please. My career has come on a slightly sort of strange route. I started doing a civil and environmental engineering undergraduate. And throughout my undergraduate, I really struggled a lot with the way in which I was taught and the way in which my entire education system had been set up. And it seemed that it was very based on knowledge. And any time I had a different way of doing it to the way the lecturer was teaching, there was never an opportunity to really try it out. I was never asked to come up with my own way of doing things, my own way of designing things. And so at the end of my five years of undergraduate university education, I felt very frustrated. And it was with this frustration that I started talking to a friend of mine and he said, well, you should try taking this FIRE course. It's really interesting. I don't know anything about FIRE. Why would I want to take the FIRE course? And so I took this FIRE class. It was just one module. And on the first day, the lecture, who I didn't know at the time, the lecture was Professor Jose Torero, asked the audience, asked this group of students, why are you here? And I thought it was a really fascinating way of starting a class to really hold this mirror up, challenge us. Why are you here? What are you trying to achieve? And throughout the rest of this module, he kept asking us, what do you think? And it was enlightening because it was the first time in five years that I'd been asked my opinion. First time in five years I'd been asked to use my brain to think. And I found this really exciting and really liberating. I really engaged with the module. There was this one class, I remember him explaining how in the lecture theatre they were sitting in that some guy had come along and stuck a door wedge underneath the door of this lecture theatre and in doing so had completely ruined the design of this building and the fire strategy of this building which by circumventing the fire door that had been put in specifically to act as a barrier. And then right afterwards, you know, and that seemed to make sense, but then right afterwards, he showed this video of two bedrooms, you know, two identical dorms, and one of them had the door open and one of them had the door closed. And he was trying to make a point about underventilated versus overventilated fires. And in the underventilated fire, it showed that the smoke hit the floor and, you know, very quickly, you know, filled up, hit the floor and the fire, you know, that had been kind of dying suddenly starts to go very, very big. Whereas the fire that was overventilated with the door open, the fire never left the bin. You know, it really saved, it was a very small fire for a very long period of time. The underventilated fire, when the smoke hit the top of the fire, it seemed like everything just ignited. The whole smoke layer ignited and everything, and he was explaining this as the process of flash over. And then I just sat there and I thought, there's something wrong here. You've just told us that having the door open with a wedge in the lecture theater is a really bad thing. And then you've just shown this video, and I see the door open performs much better. And yeah, this is bugging me, you know, because it didn't make any sense. So I emailed the lecturer afterwards, and I said, you know, this is my thinking, and I think you're wrong. Because actually the only person I seem like I can trust is the idiot with the door wedge. And he just wrote back, come see me in my office. And I went, oh no. This is like being summoned to the headmaster's office. But nevertheless, I turned up, which is the main thing I would tell any student, turn up. I said, you know, knocked on his door and I said, hi, Professor Thoreau, you know, you wanted to see me? And he said, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on. And what followed was two hours of discussion about me talking about my education and how I think it improved and him responding and, you know, challenging me. And it was just incredible conversation that resulted in, you know, and the whole time he's turning away people from his door. He's incredibly busy and people queuing up to speak to him. He's turning away. He's wanting to continue this flow, this conversation. And at the end of this, you know, I left and, you know, I didn't follow. It was just a great conversation. But then it was a couple of weeks later, he invited me back. And in this time, she offered me a job. He said, I've got money available. I only want to spend it on this. You have all of these ideas about education, and you seem to think this education system is broken, so I want you to fix it. And I said, okay, is this a one-year thing? And he said, no, it's a three-year thing. And I said, is this a PhD? And he said, yes, it's a PhD. And so I said, is this a PhD? And he said, yes, it's a PhD. And so I said, well, wow, this sounds incredible, and I would love to accept, but there's only one problem. I don't know anything about fire. And he said, yeah, that is a problem, because any work on education and developing an idea of how to teach, it would need to be done in my modules. And they're the fire modules. So they're the ones I have control over and they're the ones you can influence. And I don't want you to go into a big consultancy and to see how things are done now. I want you to keep an open mind. So maybe something that might be more interesting and more fun is to spend a summer working for the fire service. So he got me into the fire service. And after that, I started my PhD, where I started developing a way to teach to fire engineering and really to understand what it is that a fire engineer is and what it is that they need to be to be able to do the job that's necessary in society. Okay, let's go there. So based on those thoughts, what should a fire engineer look like? Like, what's the role of a fire engineer in the modern civil engineering industry? I mean, that's a hefty question. It is, yeah. And I was a co-author on a paper where we divided up the various roles that exist within the built environment to allow different practitioners within the field of fire safety to do a very specific job rather than just lumping them all together and calling them a fire engineer. Because in this country, engineer is not a protected word. It's not like in Germany where here you can call yourself a heating engineer and you can install radiators. Elsewhere, it's a protected word, just like we have architect as a protected word. So for me, it was very problematic to try and define something very clearly when actually anyone can call themselves a fire engineer. And so I then focused instead on really defining the role and the roles, I should say, and what really needs to be done in our built environment to create a safe built environment for all. So we have the fire service. The fire service come in after the fire has happened and that they have a very clearly defined remit and they have a very clearly defined set of procedures that they follow. And actually, it's kind of necessary that they follow those very rigid procedures because we rely on them doing the same thing every time. So up until the point where the fire happens is the role of the designer the fire the fire engineers uh after which it's the role of the of the fire and the firefighter so then within the building design phase you've got people who are essentially designers who are working in collaboration with well collaboration with other designers to develop a design that's holistically fire safe and the the primary person that you think of when you think of building design is an architect. And so an architect needs to have an understanding of fire safety to be able to assimilate and to incorporate fire safety into their design in a very integrated way, exactly the same way that they look at sustainability. You know, it's no longer okay for an architect to design a building in its entirety and then think about how to make it sustainable. The architects need to be thinking about sustainability in the decisions they make about materials and about construction techniques. They need to be able to assimilate that at every step of the process in order to make a holistically sustainable building. They need to be doing the same thing with fire safety. So an architect is really, really important when it comes to fire safe design in the built environment. And then, when I was, so I spent six and a half years working at Foster and Partners in London, a fairly well-known architecture practice. So really, first, we created the role at Foster's because we realized the importance of architects being really the orchestra conductor, the person who really defines the building's design. But when I was there, I realized that actually mechanical engineers developed this understanding of user experience and building design in a much broader way than you would normally expect a mechanical engineer to. You expect them to just look at pipes and pumps. But the mechanical engineers really started to understand every part of the building design so that they could then contribute their expertise in a way that would... Michael, that makes sense because it's not about placing a pipe. It's about why this pipe has to be placed there. And if you're an engineer who does not understand why, you're not going to have a great time there. Exactly. And you can be an incredible mechanical engineer, and you can figure out a million different ways of putting that pipe in that building but actually if you understand all of the drivers outside of your area of expertise if you understand the the aesthetics required by the architect you understand the structural requirements required by the structural engineers you understand the electrical requirements uh you know that within a country that you're working with you know if you understand all all of a sudden your million options suddenly gets very, very, very, very small. You know, you suddenly you're having to really, really focus on how can I work within maybe just one or two options here. So very quickly, I realized that if I spoke to the mechanical engineers about fire safety, then actually they could then take on the role of a fire safety designer and bring in fire safety into the way that they were working. designer and bring in fire safety into the way that they were working. So their duct work all of a sudden could double up the smoke extraction systems and they can design them in a perfectly capable way because they had all the knowledge already. They just needed a little bit of help from me, a little bit of knowledge from me, and they could do everything else. The same with the electrical engineers. All of a sudden, the electrical engineers, they took on the role of the detection alarm systems and they actually started to adapt and innovate and develop these ideas and make even better versions of detection alarm systems. So that actually the role of the fire engineer was reduced to someone who could work with all of these experts as the person who could define the strategy. Okay. That was the fire engineer. This is very interesting thinking because we have these core competencies. We have model curricula for training fire engineers who also participated in writing papers on this subject. I always thought that the fire design should largely be in the hands of a competent fire engineer. What you show here is that you can make other engineers competent enough. And going back to your example of a mechanical engineer with a million ideas for a pipe, being able to choose one that fits the role of the NITA, actually the fire engineer would have no idea about the million possibilities of pipes. They would only know the fire aspect of it, and they would be clueless about the technical solution that needs to be implemented. So the solution is not in the head of fire engineer and it's not in the head of Mac engineer. It's somewhere in the interface and where we can bring it. Yeah, this is very interesting thinking. This is where I came in as naive as everyone else. I joined Foster Partners thinking, because this is what I've been told, thinking that I would be creating fire-engineered solutions. I'd be bringing these solutions to the table. And I must admit, I was a bit nervous about this because I wasn't sure I had enough knowledge to bring fire-engineered solutions to some of the most technically complex buildings on the planet. But I realized it wasn't very long. I think it was on day one. Maybe it was on day two. It was certainly within the first week that I realized that I'd got the wrong end of the stick. And I remember it very clearly because I was called into a meeting with an architect, and he was describing to me a competition in central London. So it's very, very early stage. And he's got these extremely basic layouts of a plan of a building right next to, I think it was near Tower of London. So it's a very, very central location in London. And he starts asking me about the layouts and where I needed to put the core. And I thought, this is my chance. This is where I come in with my fire engineer solution. So I think you should put a staircase here. And I put it in exactly the place that I thought would be, you know, there's a million places in the staircase you can go, but I put it in like the best place from a fire safety perspective, you know, opposite ends of the floor plates, you know, good separation. This is where you put your staircase. foreplay, it's a good separation. This is where you put your staircase. And the architect, there was this awkward pause, and the architect's just looking at where I've drawn it on this bit of paper in front of him, and he's just looking like I've just said something really offensive or I've just farted. He's really, really unimpressed. And I'm waiting, and then he just says, okay, well, you see these dotted lines here? And I look, and I see exactly where I've put this staircase. There's these two parallel dotted lines going through the building. And I said, yeah. And he said, that's the view of St. Paul's Cathedral. And you've just put this enormous concrete box right in the center of this, the most important, most extensive view in this building's floor plan. And at that point, I backtracked and I said, okay, well, okay, fine. Okay, so all I want is to create two staircases that are separated so that if one is blocked, people can go to the other one. And he said, oh, well, in that case, I'd put them here and here. And the way he put them was perfect. You know, where he put them was absolutely, it was one of the other options that I could, it was absolutely fine. But I knew in that moment that actually he had 50 design variables in his head, and he was juggling all of them. And he was finding the optimized design on the basis of these 50 different variables. And I was simply adding in another one for him to assimilate. But as you said, I could not have done that on my own because I don't know the other 50. I only know the fire variant. And it would be the same with a mechanical engineer and the same with a structure engineer and so on. And so actually what we found working as a design team was where the first thing that happened in any design review of any building that I worked on, the first thing that happens, the architect would take us through. And sometimes it would be the engineer that would do this. Would take us through what the building is. What is the purpose of the building? How are you going to feel when you walk through the doors of this building? What is going to happen after you walk through the doors of that building? Where are you going to go? And what is the building for? It really was so important to understand the overall purpose of this building because all of a sudden then you could start to see the reason why it was designed in that way. Everything started to make sense. And you did not have this situation where an engineer would turn up and force a solution on the design team that would mess up the designs overall. But, okay, let's imagine a world in which the other stakeholders build the fire intuition so they have the basic understanding of what fire is. Let's assume it's not at the level of a fire safety engineer. In such a world, what's the place for a fire safety engineer? So if you have the perfect people to work with, what does the fire safety engineer does? And is it still exciting for us to be having this job? The role of the fire engineer is what it always should be, which is to define the strategy. The strategy is the story. The story of, you know, how can the fire safety of this building be perfectly aligned with the use of this building, the look and feel of this building, everything I just described about walking into the building and experiencing it. How can you align fire safety with that story you're trying to tell of a person who walks into the building? How can you make sure that that person can safely walk back out again? And with the fire, how do you want that fire to burn? Where do you want that fire to stop? Where can you allow it to burn? If you know you're going to have a fire in this building, then you need to be able to define what is going to happen. You need to be able to define what that fire is going to do and where it's going to go and where it's going to stop. And I think that will always be the remit of the fire engineer. And that in itself is sometimes so complex to develop that strategy, to develop that story, that actually you really, really want to educate everyone else in the design team to be able to understand what you're talking about, to be able to take some of the technical expertise away and to bring it within their respective disciplines and assimilate it and incorporate it as much as possible. Because the more technical expertise that can be absorbed by the other disciplines, by architects, mechanical, electrical, structural engineers, then the more likely you are to end up with a truly integrated design. But I don't think, I've not been in a situation where anyone other than a fire engineer has been able to develop a comprehensive fire strategy. So what would be the level of detail of competency of, let's say, an architect or mechanical engineer? To what extent they must understand the fire safety? Is it like just fundamentals? Is it, I don't know, having some rough idea about compartment fire dynamics? I guess that that would be far already. Yes. I mean, it's funny. I use a different definition of fundamentals to most people. So when I, when I, when, when most people think of fundamentals, they think of fundamental physics, you know, they think of, they think of gravity, they think of carbon particles and oxygen atoms, and they think of, they think of gravity, they think of carbon particles and oxygen atoms, and they think of, these are the fundamentals. But really, when I, if I were to teach an architect the fundamentals, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bother with anything like that. I would give them rule of thumb, just simple concepts, or I would, I would give them enough knowledge that they would be able to design a building that would building that any fire engineer would look at and say, that's good enough. I can work with. And those kind of simple things, such as if you have a floor plate and you have an escape route that is the only escape route available, is your design such that if there's a fire anywhere in that floor plate, a single fire, that anyone who's within that floor plate will still be able to escape to that single point of exit. That, to me, is fundamental. Okay. And if an architect understands fundamental concept as simple as that, then all of a sudden, every layout that they're going to produce thereafter, a fire engineer, almost every layout, the fire engineer is going to look at it and say, yeah, I can work with this. This is good enough. So to put it in different words, they don't need to know the fundamental diagrams, the relation between density and walking speed. They don't know. They do not need to understand the human psychology and pre-evacuation time distributions. and pre-evacuation time distributions. All they need to know is that you want to get people outside of that building from any location on your given floor. And if you're able to accommodate a design that more or less allows that, the chances that it's going to turn out bad is very low, right? Correct. And it's incredible the number of times that I've encountered a design where the architect has gone into the details. They've gone into the guidance of Part B or they've gone into a local design code. They've really gone into the details. They've been looking at millimeter tolerance. And they've given me design that I see the fundamentals are wrong. The number of times when I look at it and I just ask a very simple question. wrong. The number of times when I look at it and I just ask a very simple question. If you have a fire on this floor, if you've got the gap that you've just created here, won't fire go up into the floor above? And then they very quickly go, oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, that's a good point. I didn't think about that. There's a hole in there. There's a hole in there. I mean, it might be that all the eyes are dotted, all the T's are crossed, but actually there's something that's been staring them in the face because they've not taken a step back and just looked at it from a very simple perspective. When I talk about the fundamentals, I would much rather sit down with an architect, a mechanical engineer, a structural engineer, whoever, and just talk about common sense principles of building design that just makes sense to everyone, that we can all agree that this is just the way that it is. This is based on fundamental physics, so you don't need to understand the fundamental physics. All you need to do is understand the outcome. That is, this is the situation in which we live. And this, in any instance, this is what's going to happen. And there was a great example when I was designing a basement. I looked, and the architects and the mechanical engineers had designed this basement of a high-rise building in Brazil. And it involved jet fans. And there was no sprinklers because it didn't need to have sprinklers. And there's jet fans because this was the most common approach. And these jet fans were similar to the ones you use in tunnels. They just blow smoke around. And the idea was that you would blow the smoke around, and at some point you would extract some of it. But really the idea was to blow the smoke around. All I had to do was explain to the mechanical engineer that you have a very, very enclosed box underground with very, very low ventilation, and you have this hot smoke layer that's formed this laminar smoke layer in the top, kind of like very carefully pouring your milk on top of your coffee. And it's just sitting there. And then these jet fans come in and they stir it up. And then your job then is to, as a mechanical engineer, is to now try and extract only the milk. And, you know, the smoke is on the floor. Everything is mixed up and now everything is smoking. Now, just try and extract the smoke. And it's almost impossible. And you've got a huge problem that you've now created as a result of these jet lags. And I explained this and I don't think it was about three months later. It was a different project. This project was in Russia. And I looked at the basement and I said, oh, do you have a basement in this building? And they said, yes. And I went, oh, no. Is it a car park? Yes. Oh, no. Can I see it? And they showed it to me and I looked at it and I said, wow, this is amazing. It's got your intake on one side of the basement, your extract on the other side of the basement. It's got laminar flow. It's got firefighter access on the upstream side. This is amazing. I talked to the architect. I said, how did you know to design it like this? It's so intuitive and so clear. It's amazing. He said, oh, I just spoke to one of our mechanical engineers. He said he attended a... He said he spoke to you about it and this is what he's come up with. In a hundred years, I could not have come up with a better design. Okay. And it was, but it was just one conversation that I had that just made sense to someone who studied, you know, mechanical engineering. And they were able to then communicate to the architects who understand everything about design. Between the two of them, they were able to design a fire safe basement. All I did was come up with the strategy. I put it to the, up with the strategy. I put it to the this is what you're trying to achieve. Give the firefighters an opportunity to fight the fire. Get rid of the smoke. Don't stir it up. Go. They did everything else. It was amazing. I have to shamelessly plug a personal achievement of my life. I did actually write a book on jet fans in Polish. And it was actually bootleg translated into Russian. Like someone pirated the copy and they translated the book and put it into Russian internet and they're using it. It's quite funny. I'm not even mad. I'm actually impressed. It's funny. But I understand where you're going. Like this is the exact thing that if you tell people why. If you told the mechanical engineer, I don't need your 60,000 cubic meters per hour, I need 300,000, he would say, he would probably not give it to you. But if you explain them that suddenly you're not dealing just with the smoke layer, but you are dealing with the outcome of the operation of all the devices in your car park, which means that the sum of untrained smoke and air and everything is much bigger because the physical phenomena that happen, you explain them how they happen and why they happen and why you have to have extraction on this side because you suddenly need to vacuum all of it together. They come, okay, yeah, it seems like we need 300,000 cubic meters because they are able to calculate that. It's not you who have to, it's not the fire engineer that should do these calculations for them. They are perfectly capable to do that because that is their bread and butter. They just need to be given a reason why. Because it's a puzzle that doesn't fit what they're trying to solve, right? Exactly. So if we can all sit around the table, the fire engineer can listen to everything, can assimilate all these different ideas, all the different objectives, and we can all sit around and we can agree that this is the strategy. And actually, the strategy can be challenged by anyone. So it is also something that everyone should have input into, but it is really, the fire engineer must be the conductor of the orchestra when it comes to creating that strategy. Everyone can have their input, but really it's the fire engineer's responsibility for developing that strategy in a way that makes sure that every objective is assimilated and incorporated. And as you said, once everyone understands why, everyone knows that this is the strategy, this is what we're trying to achieve, we all agree that this is what we want, then actually they can go and do their own calculations and they can achieve that however they want, actually. And they can be very creative, actually, in achieving that. In the Hosse's keynote in Berlin, he also mentioned quite strongly that perhaps a fire engineer is not given the respect that they should have for the knowledge. They're not treated as an important part of this puzzle. should have for the knowledge. They're not treated as an important part of this puzzle. And this also can come from the fact that other stakeholders do not understand the complications in it. So if you teach someone to understand why having smoke in this location is bad, they will appreciate much more the person that can calculate how much smoke, how soon, what will be the temperature, when it will arrive, how bad it will be and how it will change if we move the fire from a corner to the middle of the room, right? It suddenly becomes a much more appreciated knowledge when someone understands what variables and what complexities go into this equation. I think in some way it's also a solution for this authority issue. Like, if you want, as a fire engineer, to really, sometimes you have to say stop. Sometimes you have to be the guy who breaks the party and say, okay, this is a bad idea, we need to dramatically change it, because it will not work on the fire world. And for these moments, you need authority. For these moments, you need respect. But through explanation and education, you that right absolutely and i mean that's another that's another experience that i had when i was when i was in professional practice there was a there were a lot of particularly architects who would bring me in who would who would explain the the building explain the objectives this is what we're trying to achieve and then would say and we've come up against this fire problem, so can you help me get this approved? And they would bring it all the way to the point where they're talking about design, they're talking about design, they're talking about design, and then all of a sudden they shift and then when it turns to fire, it's about ticking a box. And it was really frustrating for me to hear that. Now, the only thing that allayed my frustration was that the architects, almost all of them were so intelligent and were so good at design. But as soon as I said, you don't need to see this as a box ticking exercise. You don't need to tick the box. You can do whatever you want. and actually you can actually create a Firesafe design that actually achieves the objective of Firesafety just without necessarily ticking the spot. And they immediately changed and they would start to give me more respect because now I was actually talking in terms that made sense to an architect. But until that point, they had very little respect because I was simply someone to get it approved. Let me challenge that. I'm pretty sure I will fail in doing that. But let's not destroy. But it is a lot of ticking the boxes. It's a lot of getting the design approved. It's a lot of making sure it's compliant. I hate the word compliance. I always say that fire codes and law makes building compliant. Those fires save and these are completely two different things. But in the end, the building must be built. The money must be within the budget. The building must be delivered in time. If you have the choice of simply being compliant and perfecting your strategy and doing the most beautiful thing, it just loses. Compliance is such an easier and quicker way, right? But I think this is where there's been a fundamental misunderstanding with the majority of building designers. In fact, many of my fire engineering colleagues don't even understand that in the UK, you can only ever have a building that is compliant or not compliant. You cannot have a compliant product, for example. So when you look at the building, you have to ask, what is it compliant to? What do you mean by a compliant building? And in the United Kingdom, it means that it's compliant with the building regulations. There are only five requirements in the British building regulations that your building must comply with. And they're so generic and so intuitive that they're even written on the front cover of Part B. As a designer, you don't even need to open Part B to know what the five requirements are. B1, ensure people can get out of your building safely. That's it. That's what you have to be compliant with. That's what you have to be compliant with, with respect to evacuation. So anyone in your building must be able to evacuate from the building to a place of safety at all material times, throughout the lifetime of your building. So everyone needs to be able to escape. That's B1. B2, fire spread must be limited over the interior services you're building. B3, your building shouldn't collapse because of fire while people are still inside it. B4, your building should limit fire spread over the exterior of your building or between buildings to prevent Grenfell or Great Fire of London. And B5, let the fire service do their job. You know how they work. Let them do their job. That's it. If your building achieves all five of those things, it is compliant with the building regulations. Everything else in the approved document is guidance. And it is just that. And Dame Judith Hackett said guidance is guidance. And when people talk about compliance, a lot of the time they conflate the building regulations with the guidance. And so they will say, this is not compliant. This product is not compliant. It's not class O. Or this escape distance is not compliant. It's above 18 meters. And actually, that's not how we set up the system. The system is set up where it doesn't matter if one part is less safe or more safe. What you need to look at is the building fire safe, is the system fire safe. And so what we've always taught and what we built our education system on, our fire engineering education system on, is that the fire engineer must look at the system. They must design the strategy for the system. And all of the individual components must work together to develop a holistic fire safe system. In every instance where I've worked in this way, that system is also compliant. Okay. And now the problem is when you try and do it the other way around, when you try and tick the boxes and achieve compliance and then expect that to then result in a fire safe building, that's when you end up with Grenfell. Okay. Where each of the individual elements, you start to tick, tick, tick, and almost all of the elements of Grenfell followed guidance in the approved documents. So, as a whole, obviously, it was not fire safe. Okay. So, as a sum of the guidance, it didn't reach the compliance. So even though everything was ticked, I'm not sure. But the building was not compliant with the building regulations, even though it followed guidance everywhere. Okay. In Poland, we say on that the building burned down according to regulation. And it is a very common phrase you hear everywhere, even on important meetings, like, gentlemen, when this building burns down, let's make sure it burns down according to the law. It's a box-ticking exercise, really. It's really interesting because I completely agree. So I've worked on many, many projects where I've been able to talk to the local authority and to be able to talk to the building regulator. And they've said, you've exceeded the guidance in this area, you've exceeded the guidance. And I've even gone to the point, I walked around with an improved inspector and with a firefighter around one of our buildings. And I pointed out, I said, this part here, not aligned with the guidance. This part here exceeds the guidance. This part here, we've not followed the guidance. And I've explained in each aspect, the reason why this building is still safe is because this doesn't matter, or we have an additional element over here. It was not a box-ticking exercise, because in each instance, I could back it up with science. Any argument that they could throw at me, either it stuck, there was a good argument, either actually I needed to do a better job and change the design, or I just needed to work harder. I needed to provide more evidence, better evidence, that the design would work the way I was saying it was going to work. And I was perfectly happy to do that. I could go and do the calculations. I could add additional justification, whatever was necessary. But in every instance, I was strengthening the designs. We were either adapting it to make it better, or I was simply adding more rigor to the arguments that we were making. Now, the problem is that many building regulators, many approved inspectors, many people who are meant to be signing off these buildings, they do not have the technical competency. They are themselves, maybe they're an ex-firefighter with no knowledge of fire science and no knowledge of building design. Maybe they are someone who simply moved into this field from a chartered surveyor. Maybe they don't know enough about fire, whatever the reason. Maybe they don't have the technical competency. And the problem then is that they feel this comfort with relying on the guidance, and they drop back to the guidance. And as you said, it becomes very problematic that they just insist that you tick the boxes. Now, what will be one of the main outcomes of the Grenfell public inquiry in this country is that that system will change. Okay. That you are no longer able to hide behind the guidance. And it's coming, I can guarantee it, this year when the recommendations come out from the judge, the conclusions of the public inquiry come out, it will be that simply saying that you ticked the box and you did your bit and therefore your job was fulfilled and you are not liable, that will not stand up in court. So no more burned according to the law. Correct. They're going to stop that. And the way they're going to do it is they're going to say, you are professionally competent. And if you are professionally competent, then you should know. You should know that putting plastic on the outside of a building is not okay. And as an architect, you should know. You should know that putting plastic on the outside of a building is not okay. And as an architect, you should know that. It doesn't matter that it ticked the box and passed the test. It doesn't matter that it's got a class O rating or a class B rating or anything else. What matters is that you as an architect should have the technical competency to know that putting plastic on the outside of a building in this context, in a high-rise building, with a single means of escape. In this particular instance, that it is not appropriate, is liable for fire safety. And actually, the ARB, the Architectural Registration Board, who accredits architects in this country, they have actually preempted this. You can Google it. You can Google the ARB fire safety guidelines. And I think they've actually, I think they've overstepped. Because what they're saying is that architects should be competent to understand fire spread in building design. They need to understand the fundamentals of fire spread. They need to understand material properties. It goes into details that I would expect competent fire engineers to know. So their fundamentals went way beyond how we defined them. Way beyond. And what it means now is that architects are now being put on the hook for things that their fire engineers should normally be. Okay, but it's unrealistic that they will know that. But they're going to be liable for it. This is what I'm saying. So now the architects are now starting to wake up that they need, not only are they unable to rely on the guidance, but actually they need to expand their knowledge to the point when they're able to design fire-safe buildings almost on their own. And I think this is, I think ARB has overstepped in this. I don't think architects should be expected to know that much about fire. I think they should be expected to know, to be able to work competently with a competent fire engineer. But wait, this has really significant consequences, not even in the case of fire. Okay, if it burns down, people die. This is a very, very horrible outcome. But fires are rare. This is also why having an ex-firefighter as an expert based only on their experience from the lifetime of their career is not very good. Because even in a career of a firefighter who attended thousands of fires, it's very unlikely they've seen all the possibilities. It's just simply... The statistical sample is way too small to train this machine learning algorithm in the head of them. Anyway, but cutting out fire, let's imagine Grand Hall happens now, and you go into remediation program, and you have to replace thousands of facades. In this setting, if now it's publicly well known that this facade on my building, which did not burn down, is perfectly standing still, but we know that it is fire safe to the point where it's endangering people and it needs to be replaced, which costs a hell of a lot of money. In this case, architect would be liable for the mistake of putting that facade there in the first place and could be put into execution or something for doing that, even though the fire didn't happen. Well, it would become a civil case. It would become a civil case because someone needs to pay. And actually, the first... As soon as we realized that this is coming, and we've actually created a new M-Arch, a Masters in Architecture in fire-safe design at UCL. And we've done this because we believe that architects actually already have the competency to design fire safe buildings they simply need a little little bit of extra knowledge the fundamentals as i was saying uh they need to understand where they'd be lied to and where there are assumptions made in society and in our system that actually need to be dispelled need to be replaced but with with actual knowledge that they can rely on and um and so we've created this one-year, five-module M-Arch targeted specifically at architects. And we think that that's the only way that the architects can not only design fire-safe buildings, but actually prevent themselves being sued for every mistake that they could possibly make with respect to fire-safe design, such as the one you just described, where the fire never actually happened. Nevertheless, the facade needs to be replaced at the cost of 2 million pounds. The structure hasn't changed, yeah. And so as soon as we started approaching architecture practices, they said, have you spoken to the insurers? And it turns out that actually two insurance companies insure almost all of British architecture practices. And so we called, I sent them an email, and they wrote back in a second. two insurance companies insure almost all of British architecture practices. And so we called, I sent them an email, and they wrote back in a second. Within a day, we'd organized a meeting. Professor Jose Torero was going to go and give a talk explaining everything I just explained to you. They could not wait. It was at Christmas. On the 22nd of December, they were emailing me, asking me to come in and give a talk. And we pushed it to the end of January. We arrived and they immediately said, you need to come back in a month's time. And we're going to invite all of our architects. We had a meeting with 80 architecture practices represented in the room. And Jose told them exactly what I just told you, that this change is coming. and you are going to be on the hook not just for the fire safety of your buildings, but for the inevitable civil lawsuits that are going to take place as a result of building designs that need to change because of decisions you have made that are now deemed to be not safe. And someone is going to come looking for the money. And it was incredible. It was a fantastic response. We're now following up with many of those practices. Some of them work particularly in tall building design. Some of them work in structural timber. Some of them want specific focus on facades. There's several areas where you can see that the shift in liability onto architects is now having a profound impact on the way in which we're designing buildings. Does this go only into architects? Because in Poland, the structural engineer would be an important person. The main mech engineer would be an important person. It's an interesting one because it was so clear that... The point was made so clearly that there really always needed to be one person who was responsible. What happened in the Grenfell Inquiry was everyone in the system just pointed at the person next to them and said, you know, I did my bit. It's not mine, it's theirs. It was not mine, it's theirs. And so it was called the web of blame. If you watch the concluding remarks, it's only 10 minutes. I would certainly recommend watching the concluding remarks of the Grenfell Public Inquiry. only 10 minutes. I would certainly recommend watching the cleaning remarks of the Grenfell Public Inquiry. He talks about the web of blame. So in order to prevent that, they created one entity, and that one entity would be almost singularly responsible for the design of the building, and that entity would be called the principal designer. And the structural engineers, the mechanical engineers, they all ran a mile from this role. They did not want to take it because it holds all the liability. In fact, the REBA and ARB, the Reputations of the British Architects, they really wanted this role. They thought the architect should be in charge. They thought the architect should take the role of the principal designer. And so it seems like that's the way that it's going. And in many cases, in most projects, the architect will find themselves in the principal design role and will find themselves holding the baby. So can you train enough M-Arch fire competence architects soon enough? No, is the short answer. We're recruiting as fast as we can, but we're one university. And there are simply too many architects in an industry that's too well established that I really hope that we're going to be able to supplement the M-Arch with CPD, Continued Professional Development, throughout the year, that can at the very least provide the fundamentals to practicing architects in a way such that we can get through this initial phase where, you know, I hope, I really, really hope at one point in the future, this standalone MRH and fire safe design will disappear. I hope to make ourselves redundant because I really, really hope that these five modules will be incorporated as a core component of any architecture degree program. But still, to clear it out, so I understand completely, your MR course is architecture. It's not fire safe design. It's architecture? Correct. The idea is that we've already established the IMFSE program, which teaches very competent, highly trained, the most competent. Yeah, I love the IMFSE. I think it's brilliant. I don't want to change it. But the problem is the IMFSE students are going out into industry as graduates, and they're sitting next to an architect, and the architect is still asking them, can you get my building approved? So we need to simultaneously upskill the architects to be able to ask the right questions of those IMFSE grads. So the two should work, you know, as sister programs. They should work concurrently and they should work to create graduates who can work very effectively together as part of the design team. Okay, makes sense. Make sure to tell them to listen to Fire Science Show. It's a good CPD. This is very, very interesting. You've said that this is the MRG is a way to take down this, let's say, liability problem from there. Because you said by creating the course, you said the certain competencies that you believe they should have. And you say, okay, this is what they need to know. But this is like enough. So that's enough for them to to call them a competent architects this is why you take down the liability okay exactly so we're trying to to bring the architects to the point where they can design fundamentally fire safe buildings where you can get rid of 90 of any of the issues straight away and so by and in doing so you can you can head off any potential financial risk and also any potential liability associated with designing a building that is not fire safe and also gives the architects the opportunity to see where is the limit of their knowledge. Because we do not want to turn every architect into a fire engineer. As I just said, we want to become good enough and we want them to be able to engage with into a fire engineer. As I just said, we want to become good enough, and we want them to be able to engage with a competent fire engineer, for example, from the IMFSE program. So there is really no need to educate architects to the point when they can do all of the fire engineering. We don't want that. All we want is for them to recognize, A, to design a building that's good enough, and B, to be able to pick the right fire engineer to work with. Because there are a lot of charlatan fire engineers, you could say, who maybe don't have a degree in fire engineering, who don't have any real competency. And at the moment, maybe the architect is not able to choose between them, and is not able to pick out the IMFSC grad as someone who is technically competent. But if they do have that base level of understanding, they understand the limits of their own competency, and they understand who to employ, who is the competent fire engineer from the lineup, then I think that's it. That's what we're trying to achieve. I was once told to not argue with idiots publicly, because for bystanders, it's difficult to tell the difference. But there is something in it with the charlatan fire engineers and the competent ones. So, final question, architects already have a lot on their table. You think adding the fire safety as the 51st objective, they have to think from this conversation, you've shown examples that it happens. But do you think, en masse, it is possible to add that to their table? They can incorporate that in their frameworks? Absolutely. I think what you'll find is that if I was to sit down with any competent architect, they would see what I was saying as entirely intuitive. It would not be in any way onerous. They wouldn't need to memorize anything. Everything that I say would just make sense because they already know it. They knew it intuitively. And actually, a few sessions like this, and that's it. And actually, not only do I think that it can happen in the way that I've just described, just in basic principles and intuitive understanding of building design, intuitive understanding of fire science and the way that I've just described, just some basic principles and intuitive understanding of building design, intuitive understanding of fire science and the way in which fire moves and the way in which people respond to fire. You know, a few sessions like that, that's how it can happen. But in addition, the political context we're in now, it must happen because I'm afraid whether you like it or not, as an architect, you are on the hook. I'm afraid whether you like it or not, as an architect, you are on the hook. The law is going to say that you need that 51st variable in your arsenal. And it doesn't actually matter whether it's tough or difficult or otherwise. You're on the hook. You're liable. You cannot avoid it. Good. Fantastic. I went into this episode with a name in mind. I wanted to talk about competent fire engineer, but I think I'm going to rename the episode to competent fire architect. It's much more fitting to the theme of the discussion. And it's amazing, I think, what you put forward in here. I think it's a very nice framework that allows, again, engineers to do the job they're best at and not waste time on issues they shouldn't be wasting time on and then turn fire safety engineering exercise from ticking boxes into engineering. Brilliant. I would love to live in a world like that. Yeah, me too. Let's make it happen. Yeah, if you finish your MR experiment, because it's going to be the first season, right? It's the first year you're running it. Oh, man. Book time in the calendar. After the first year, you need to come back here and tell me how it went or maybe we can catch up in the middle. And I will also try to put this episode in front of as many architects as possible because I think for them, this episode of the podcast could be more valuable then for fire engineers. Absolutely. And maybe we can interview one of the students. Absolutely. I'd be more than happy to discuss their experience, good or bad. You know, you don't even need to invite me. This is a very honest podcast, and I especially like drama. Anyway, Michael, thank you so much for coming to Fire Science Show. It was amazing. And all the best in developing M-Arch. Crossing my fingers that it works. Thank you, Wojciech. Great to be here. Thank you. That's it. Thank you for listening. It seems that a major shift is coming in the UK market following the Grenfell inquiry and the findings in it. And I think it's a very interesting shift that puts fire safety back in the focus of what the design should be so it seems a lot of this will include our friends at architecture so if you know one you really may want to send them this podcast episode so they learn from Michael all those brilliant thoughts shared in here I thought it was very intriguing to try and educate architects so we can work with them better and actually focus on our job instead of focus on arguing and stuff that's perhaps not the bread and butter of fire engineering or should not be the bread and butter of fire engineering. Anyway, a ton of interesting things in this podcast episode. I will be sure to follow up the M-Arch at UCL, how it is going, what they've achieved, and in a year we'll see if it worked out or not. And I'm happy to bring Michael back in the podcast to find out what has happened. So once again, thank you, Michael, and to all of you, thank you so much for listening. Last week I received two really nice reviews at Apple Podcasts that really made my day. I appreciate this a lot, and it really helps the podcast, so if you're out there and you've enjoyed episodes like this, you may also leave me a five-star rating and a review on Apple Podcasts or Spotify or on my website. This goes a long way. So thank you so much. And as usual, see you here. Same time, same place next Wednesday. Cheers. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
