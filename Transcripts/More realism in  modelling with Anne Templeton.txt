 Hello, everybody. Welcome to Fire Science Show Session 52. Today, we're jumping back into the world of human behavior and sorts of evacuation modeling. I have invited a really great guest, Dr. Anne Templeton of University of Edinburgh, where she leads her group, research group on identities and collective behavior. Actually, she also has a page that's called like that, identitiesandcollectivebehavior.com. So that's actually quite a good resource already plugged into the start of the podcast. With Anne, we're going to discuss group behavior and collective behavior in crowds, which is a very interesting thing. When we model our evacuation processes, we usually observe these large groups of people moving together. But our approaches cannot distinguish between physical crowds and psychological crowds and what that means you'll learn in the episode. So we are modeling the groups, but not really modeling the group behavior of it. And this group behavior can change the response rate of the group. It can change the walking speeds. It can affect multiple parameters that we usually investigate with high-fidelity models. So it's very interesting to be able to understand these complexities. And really, they jump into this interesting field of social psychology to see where it's going. I'm not sure if today we are at the state where this can be modeled explicitly altogether. I guess not. I guess it's still work in progress. But this work is very exciting and the progress is great. So I guess you'll enjoy this episode a lot because the things that are talked in here will be part of our work sooner or later and definitely deserve more interest from the world of fire science. So let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody. I'm here today with Dr. Anne Templeton from University of Edinburgh. Hello Anne. Great to have you. Hi. Thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure. It's a joy to have you and learn some stuff on social psychology and crowd psychology, actually. That's a topic that I don't know almost anything about it. So I'm more than happy to learn a lot firsthand today and share that journey with my viewers. We're going to delve right in. Yeah, let's go. Give me hardcore. No, no, no simplifications. Go with equations. No, equations don't work in podcasts, but everything else works. So the first thing when we're talking about behaviors of large groups of people, I always wondered, the first thing that comes to my mind, when it stops to be an individual behavior and when it starts to be a group behavior, you know? When I stop being human, I become a sheep and move with everyone else. And I think that's probably a good point to start the discussion on crowd psychology. that's probably a good point to start the discussion on crowd psychology. Well, from a crowd psychology perspective, we always talk about physical crowds and psychological crowds. And the distinction is that a physical crowd, a physical crowd is something that you might see in a shopping center or a transport hub where you have people who happen to be there at the same place at the same time maybe with their friends or family but otherwise they're not really connected with the others in the crowd they just happen to be there a psychological crowd on the other hand that's where the group processes come in and that's really what we focus on in crowd psychology so that is where people in the crowd feel like they're part of a group with others, and they feel like others are in the same group as them. And that's where we start to see collective behavior. And in social psychology, we talk a lot about social identity theory. This is the idea that we have personal identities. These are things that are idiosyncratic to to us as individuals so for example i have a squint eye i am not a morning person that kind of thing i don't look too much my eyes now and but then we have social identities and these social identities refer to our memberships as part of social groups and that social group can be anything really so it can be you know you're a fan of a particular sports team that you are a runner that you're an academic you're an engineer that you're a firefighter and these social groups are important because they tell us a lot about how we should act in certain situations. These groups have definitions, they have values, they've got behaviours associated with them. Now, that's not to say that we're not acting as individuals. We don't lose our ability to reason, to be rational. It's just that what's important in that context, when we're in those group situations and we feel like part of a group group is we're guided by what it means to be part of that group. And so what's important to the group is important to us because we're part of that group. So that would mean a crowd of a given number in the shopping mall and the crowd of the same number in an office where everyone knows each other will be, from your perspective, a completely different crowds. Yeah. will be, from your perspective, completely different crowds. Yeah. And I'm giving them almost the same pre-evacuation time, treating them as almost the same mass of people. Yeah. So, okay, I understand why you guys classify it under complexity, because it very quickly becomes very complex. When you're a member of this, let say random crowd not not a group do you as scientists still observe this group's behavior i i don't know maybe group is forming like like in lost when they are stuck together on the island they form a group bunch of strangers yeah maybe that is a blast from the past i haven't seen lost in a long time but excellent series it's a great point so for us the kind of distinction between the physical and psychological crowd is in the psychological crowd there's that sense of being part of the same group so we do see collective behavior and physical crowds because you still see families and small groups of friends for example right but that's very much subgroup behavior it's not kind of widespread throughout the crowd and your example there of a kind of in an office environment if you have an evacuation and if that would be different from say something in shopping center I think that's really interesting because there's been a ton of work that's been done on evacuations and emergencies where you've had people who were in physical crowds that have become psychological crowds in the emergency because of that common fate of the emergency. So there's been great work by New Jordan Jewelry, Chris Cocking, Steve Reicher. They've done some fantastic work with survivors of the London bombings, July 7th, 2005 London bombings. And have you ever been to London? Yep. Have you ever been in London Underground? Yep, fantastic place. Yeah, it is. So at commuting time, which is when the attacks happened, when you're on the tube, you don't look at anybody else. You don't interact. You don't want to catch someone's eye. It's awkward, right? You're just there trying to get to your job, just going about trying to find a seat. And so that's a physical crowd. That's commuters. They're not connected. They're actively unconnected. But when the emergency happened, when the bomb was detonated, people started to come together because they felt like they were part of the same group. And people started to come together because they felt like they were part of the same group. And so John Drury, Chris Cocking, Steve Reicher, they conducted interviews and looked at media accounts of reactions to the London bombings. And they found again and again that when the survivors were explaining helping behaviour, like helping others to evacuate, going back into dangerous areas, preventing first aid, tying tourniquets, providing emotional support, all sorts of stuff. They all said it was on the basis of feeling part of the same group. So it's that feeling part of a group was motivating people to provide that support and help others evacuate. Now, not everyone felt part of the same group in all emergencies. I'm not saying that. There is going to be variability. But we see this continual theme of the public and emergencies coming together that transformation from the physical crowd to the psychological crowd and this collective behavior on the basis of that group membership and i think that's that's amazing yeah it is and now outside of it being interesting and fun let's talk about how how useful it is like do you as a scientist observe that uh a physical crowd would have a like different i don't know response characteristic or different like overall behavior over a grouped crowd in the macro scale i think that that's a great question so i can talk about work i've done on collective behavior just on walking behavior how feeling part of the same group impacts so staff that during my phd at the university of sussex i conducted a few experiments on walking behavior so pedestrian movement and this kind of came about because we see pedestrian models computer computer models of pedestrian behavior, who are simulating how people navigate space. And that's all grand, but we thought from a crowd psychology perspective, one thing that was missing was group processes, this feeling part of a group with others. And so one of the experiments I did was I went into a second year psychology statistics lecture and I recruited a bunch of participants to take part in a psychology experiment. I said that they were being recruited because they were Sussex psychology students and we had these black baseball caps that had like Sussex psychology and the psychology logo on them and we recruited them to walk to the student bar now the reason that I did that was because I wanted to see what the movement behavior was when people felt like they were part of the same group and I could directly compare that walking behavior to footage I'd take it so I filmed it from above and i could directly compare that behavior to fish taken previously of the same people coming out of lecture theater when they hadn't been primed to feel part of the same group and so we could see this difference between when there was a physical crowd of friends who've been in lecture theater but otherwise pretty unconnected compared to when we primed them to feel part of the same group as those Sussex psychology students. So you turned them into a group by giving them hats and a common identity? Yeah, we primed that existing identity. So they were already Sussex psychology students, right? That's why they were in that statistics lecture. So we just made that salient. So that was important for how they saw themselves and saw others at that time and we gave them the hats not only to remind them of their own identity but so they could see who else was in their group and for when I was filming footage from above a bridge I could see who was taking part in the experiment for tracking their movement and what we found was that people who felt part of a group, when we had this psychological crowd, they altered their behavior. So in terms of physical proximity, they move much more closely together. And when we look at subgroup sizes, in the physical crowd, when we hadn't done any manipulation, we had maybe people in pairs, maybe threes or groups of three or four. But then in the psychological crowd, it was much larger. You were seeing like eight to ten people. And actually, it was really hard to divide them into subgroups as they were moving. They were always chatting to each other, coordinating. And so they were much, apart from being much kind of physically closer together, they also reduced their speed to kind of walk together. much kind of physically closer together. They also reduced their speed to kind of walk together, and they walked a further distance, not from A to B, actually between their different steps, because they were always kind of coordinating around each other to stay together as a group. So even just on that basic level, when you feel like others are part of your group, we thought there was this collective coordination of them just trying to stay together. And what if crowd is consisting of a bunch of medium-sized groups? Like you'd have first-year lectures, students, second year, third year, and they all would associate with each other but not with the others. Yeah, so I think that's what we saw in the physical crowd because it was the same participants, same people, right, from the same lecture. It was just a few weeks before. And we could see people who were in those small groups. it was the same participants, same people, right, from the same lecture. It was just a few weeks before. And we could see people who were in those small groups. You could see those kind of friendship groups. And so they were more physically apart. You could see it very distinctly, these clear subgroups. And they walked faster and less distance because they were just kind of like going to their end point and not really coordinating around each other as much. like going to their end point and not really coordinating around each other as much. And were you investigating anything in terms of how they respond to information? Like, I really wonder if group is processing the information as a group or each individual is processing, like there's a fire alarm. That's a really good question. So we didn't look at it in that experiment, but I've recently been doing interviews and surveys with residents of high-rise buildings. And we've been specifically looking at that role of group processes and how they decide to respond in emergencies. And we found quite a lot of stuff that has come out of these interviews and surveys. But one of the things that keeps coming up is that people who feel in the same group as others in the building are more likely to seek them out in the building they're more likely to go and look for them you know stick their head into the corridor ask others what to do they kind of seek information from each other about how to react and share information with them as well and they will even go further into the building in the event of a fire to help other group members to help people they see as being in their group but also to get information from them and so we see this kind of this is this is self-report this is people saying either what they would do in an emergency in the event of a fire or what they had done previously and we see this again and again and it's not only that people go and look for information that they'll delay evacuating they'll give information is very much related to how much they feel in a group with others and they will trust information from people they feel are part of their group more than people they feel aren't and that's tricky right because it might be that you have i don't know a fire warden for example giving you information and you're getting contradictory information from your direct neighbor about the fire yeah and if you trust your neighbor more if you see them as more part of your group more self-relevant they have more direct information that's relevant to you there's a chance you're going to listen to them if you have lower trust of that fire warden. It's quite an extreme example. No, no, it's not extreme, actually. It's very down to earth because I think we've entered a really useful engineering territory. I often end up doing evacuation studies for high-rise buildings when the high-rise building is just being delivered. It's not sold yet. And the way how they sell high-rise buildings, at least in here, is usually there's company A that would buy like 10 floors, there's company B that would buy 7, company C would buy 20 or something, I don't know. But the evacuation scenario, especially when we go into selective evacuation, like floor by floor, to limit the waiting time, it's insensitive, you know, to this possible group identity or group interaction. You know, there's a good chance we would evacuate floor 15 of company A with floor 30 of company B together. And there's a good chance we would evacuate one company for a very long time. And there's a good chance these people, because they work in the same company, they could already communicate between them and either realize it's a fire, they need to escape or figure out this is training and they don't want to be bothered with this stupid nonsense to get out of the building. And in both cases, it challenges our design concept. Like, I think it's us who do the mistake there, designing this in a way that is very artificial compared to how real world works. You see any way how, or are you working maybe on a way that this could be incorporated in the design of all building evacuation systems? Something that I keep finding is that social influence is so important. So who's looked to for information and how trusted the information is keeps coming up again and again when people are saying how they would respond to an emergency and on one hand that is you know delaying evacuation to seek information from from people in your group or to give information or help them to leave but another thing is when you have residents of high-rise buildings they're given safety information right what to do in the event of a fire. And that could be a leaflet to the door. It could be a training session. It depends. And what I found, especially in interviews, was that often if the information was coming from something like a tenants management association, who the participant didn't really see as being on their side, they were just this kind of other that were putting a leaflet through the door. They would ignore it. It would go in the bin. The leaflet would go straight in the bin. But if it was training, say, or information from fire and rescue services, they would pay more attention because they felt like fire and rescue services were acting on their behalf. They were acting for the group. And so we see this kind of who's listened to, whose information is listened to and trusted is really impacted by those perceptions of who is in the group and who is acting on behalf of the group. And this also is particularly important. You mentioned there about, you know, kind of phase evacuation. A lot of the high-rise buildings that we have have stay-put policies in place, where people have to stay where they are in the event of a fire because the buildings are supposedly built to be safe and people can stay put. There is so, well, I found that there was so little trust in that. And so if you have this leaflet saying stay put until told otherwise, and you have a neighbour, your friend neighbor your friend saying no we need to evacuate you're going to listen to your neighbor now there is a lot more that goes into it like trust in the building for example knowledge of the guidance all this stuff is important i don't want to disregard that but whose information is trusted again is impacted by group relations and that is so important if we're thinking about how to roll out evacuation guidance or even what to an event of a fire type guidance if we're looking at models of evacuation behavior i think putting these group processes in are so important especially because we keep seeing in emergencies people who are previously unconnected can come together as a group and that then affects their behavior this is brilliant so essentially we can as engineers we can put a lot of effort into designing a strategy for a building. Phased evacuation could be one example. State policy could be another one that you've brought. But I can see more, like use or do not use elevators, you know. There can be a building where elevators are used in evacuation, but people will not use them because they are all lives. They were told that you do not use elevator in case of fire. Yeah, there may be some sort of evacuation floor where people can survive fire with enhanced capabilities. So there's a lot of possible scenarios where you would like people to do a very certain thing. Otherwise, they are in danger potentially. And now we need to make the people go there. And you say that the trust to information or the trust who gave you the information may be actually a critical factor in there. So for us as engineers, designing the information is one way, but the way how we pass it can mean yes or no for the results. So I think what you're saying is not only interesting, but I think this should be used in designing how we convey information. If you know group has leaders or or people who people trust it is probably reasonable to to use the leaders to convey the information well it's an interesting question i mean talking about leaders what we often see is that there isn't necessarily a clear leader as such in terms of like you might see that some insecurity was was a leader or there was like a kind of leader of a church group something like that we don't tend to see that we tend to see a lot of this kind of collective um coordination this collective self-organization where people are collectively deciding how to respond obviously that's a bit different if you think someone has more information if they know the guidance more, like that does have an influence. But we don't really see kind of clear leaders come out as much as a lot of collective coordination. However, in terms of kind of guidelines that include these group processes, there's two things. So one is that I also did uh interviews with fire and rescue services myself and clear nash she actually conducted the interview she's brilliant and fire and rescue services so we can not think of 23 interviews about an hour long each individual interviews and fire and rescue services they were saying they see how much the public wants to help, how much they want to provide support. And they also see this importance of building good relations with the residents so that they are listened to when an emergency happens. And not only so, like building those kind of positive relations with residents and keeping that kind of community building, which is so important. But also they were right on the money when they were saying that they don't only give guidance, say this is what you should do. They also say this is why you should do it so that people are able to make informed choices. And that's so important as well, again, people to adhere. Holly Carter at Public Health England has done loads of work on this with Professor John Drury at the University of Sussex. She's done some fantastic experiments, field studies, where she has altered the type of communication that's been given by first responders. This was a CBRN decontamination experiment. And she altered the type of communication that was given to the people going through the decontamination from the first responders. And she found that depending on the type of communication you gave, it influenced the extent to which the people followed the guidance. And this is because the guidance that was given impacted the perceived legitimacy of those first responders, like how legitimate they were in their roles. The shared social identity of the responders, therefore, how much we feel like they're part of the same group as us. And then how quickly they went through the decontamination. She measured a bunch of other things as well. But the kind of key take home point from this study that I really love, and I think her work is so convincing she finds this again and again is that when you tell people exactly what they need to do and why they need to do it and you give them updates about what's happening they see the guidance as more legitimate they see the people giving the guidance as being part of the same group you're together, and they're more likely to follow the guidance. So at its most basic level, I think that telling people what they actually need to do and why they need to do it so they buy into it is so important. And often we see in emergencies that information is maybe withheld from the public about what to do, or there's a delay before we get that kind of response. And often doesn't necessarily say why you need to do the information, it's not highly informative. And that can have very negative consequences, because we also see in emergencies that again and again, the people will start to collectively coordinate their own response. They'll start helping each other. There's this great need to do something to provide help. And so on one hand, they can be doing amazing things, but if they haven't got the full information, then that can be tricky. That can be tricky to work with. So I would argue it's really important to give the information to people so they know how to respond. They know exactly what they're meant to be doing. The group processes, so much comes into that as well. And if we turn into not positive but negative ethics, have you also observed this group behavior that led into some sort of disasters? I don't know, maybe people choosing to stay put based on the group. You mentioned that before, that you can ignore some warning because the group said so. But do we have evidence that a group behavior could have been a ruling factor in some disaster? Because that's also a way how we can prevent them, right? In terms of theory, I think it could happen. And we see people delaying evacuation to help others. But then who's to say that that wouldn't actually lead to a more effective evacuation because you get more people out. It might be slower, but you get more people out in the end. So it's tricky. One thing that does tend to happen is you see this in aftermath of grenfell for example the public really really want to help and so they'll give all the resources and unless it's coordinated because of that need to help it can be they can you have a bunch of resources you're not really sure what to do with if you look at remember the ariana grande concert in the manchester arena where there was the attack so the care slack report that came out in the Manchester Arena where there was the attack so the Keraslack report that came out in the aftermath of that where they looked at accounts from crowds of colleges looked at accounts from first responders look everyone and one of the kind of key take-home issues of that was how much the public wanted to help and wanted to apply for a stage and everything but didn't necessarily know how to do it. And so the argument that the Carousel Act report made really clearly was give them the resources to do it properly. I think that's the key thing. If you have people who want to help, make sure they're able to do it safely and in the right ways. And that involves coordinating with them because often the public will know a lot more about what's going on as well because they've been there from moment zero. You wrote a paper about more realism in pedestrian behavior models. Yeah. I love the title. My first thought, do we really want realism? That's a tough choice, you know, because realism adds complexity and, from my perspective, sometimes reduces utility of the simulation. Like, sometimes imprecise simulation can give you more knowledge than a very precise and beautiful study which leads nowhere. That actually could be my first question about modeling. What's the value in more realism in pedestrian behavior models? How do you view that? I mean, that's a great question. And I fully agree it was a bold title. I was actually updating my website a while ago and had to put in paper titles. And I remembered one that is humans not always act selfishly. I was like, I'm seeing a theme of just bold titles. But to answer your question in terms of getting more realism models now i don't know if we can ever get full realism model fix there are so many assumptions that we put in but i think something that's missing is evidence from crowd psychology about group behavior so we have run lots of experiments on how people uh react in crowds we have so many surveys that we've had with people at crowd events. We've got this huge, huge wealth of knowledge about how group processes impact behavior. But until quite recently, that empirical research wasn't being put into pedestrian models. We did have a lot of group behavior that was covered in models but a lot of it was based on assumptions of behavior or atheoretical accounts of behavior or old theories that have been largely outdated and discredited and there are better explanations and so something I really wanted to kind of do in my line of work was look at okay so how can we look at the role of group processes in a way that informs pedestrian models? And until a few years ago, there were very different disciplines, but now there are lots of people who are interested in this, which has been fantastic to see the strength and change. But it's tricky because we have to think, okay, so what parts of group behavior do we want to put in the models? Because we can't put absolutely everything. They get really, really complicated quickly. We need to kind of find a starting point. of group behavior do we want to put in the models because we can't put absolutely everything to get really really complicated quickly we need to kind of find a starting point and what evidence do we have that we can kind of measure the models against to see how well they're actually simulating this behavior and so that's why i tried to design experiments like the walking behavior experiment i told you earlier when we when we find people to feel like they were part of the same group. The idea is that we want to kind of look at, if we manipulate this one thing about group processes, what effect does it have on behavior? And you can supplement that with surveys, for example, get motivations, et cetera. It really is just finding a way of running experiments where you can say, all right, if we just manipulate this one thing, what happens? And then how do we put that into a model? How do we even put that into an algorithm? How do we then test it? What I love doing is saying, all right, I've got this future crowd behavior, got these stats on proximity, the distance from each other in proximity we've got speed and all this kind of information about you know who was in what group if we run the same scenario in a model can we get this similar behavior in the outcome simulation can we match it up to real world behavior and so far i think we've still got a long way to go but it's a really interesting challenge how we condense all this huge theory that's what i was trying to get out of the paper is how we condense this huge amount of theory and all this knowledge from social psychology and especially cross psychology into a model how do we test these bits in a manageable way and it's been i absolutely love this work it's one of my favorite things because it is involved working with pedestrian modelers computer scientists mathematicians fire engineers even designing like shared vocabulary because we found that we had very different definitions of the same words which the conversation is very confusing to try and work out okay how do we do this and it's led to so many exciting collaborations like with enrico who you had on one of your previous podcasts doing work with him on evacuation behavior we use virtual reality experiments to try and manipulate who in this scenario is seen as in group or out group who's part of the group or not how much do we attend to them how does that influence our behavior this work is led by john jury university sussex again, doing that work with Fergus Neville, Mike Attell, Gunn, Steve Reicher over at St. Andrews. And it's a really nice interdisciplinary, actually multidisciplinary project that is just a joy to work with, because that's really trying to get data that we can look at. And then later on down the line, we say, all right, how can we use this to inform models and test models against it? At what place of the model would that affect it? I would identify like a sub-model where someone takes a decision, a sub-model of walking, a sub-model of Q formation. So is it on all of these fields where this crowd psychology or social identity can influence? I think this is a great question because before I used to think, okay, you have this locomotion model, this pedestrian movement model, then you have this kind of psychological layer. And that's work that we did with Gert Koster and Isabella von Sievers. And actually, when you think about it, so these great processes impact our perceptions as well as our behavior. And so it influences how we perceive the information we receive how we process that information and how how that then affects our outcomes so i think it really needs to be embedded in many steps of the model and it's tricky to work out where the best place is to do that so for in terms of, imagine you're modelling a high-rise building, a fire goes off. You might assume, okay, everyone immediately evacuates or everyone follows the state put. But actually what we find is that people aren't really sure quite how to respond. And so they'll look to each other for information and then decide how to act. So they see the stimulus, they see this fire, they then seek information about it, try and work out how threatening it is and what behaviour to actually take, and then they act. So we kind of need it at those different stages. I wish I had a concrete answer to like, here is exactly where, but I'm still puzzling it out. It's developing fields, like rapidly developing fields. So I don't think anyone expects solid answers. Like we understand it is so different from what are we doing today? You know, those are there, there needs to be concrete evidence for us to switch our behavior because, you know, today, if you're a consultant, there's a very specific way you approach a project related to evacuation. You're essentially interested in maybe three things. One would be the total evacuation time. Second would be bottlenecks. The third would be waiting time. So you want to optimize for those three, maybe a little more. But these are the points you would look for in your evacuation model. would look for in your evacuation model. And now if I would like to have more realism in the simulation, the question is how that translates to the answers of the modeling, but also it can translate to the fact that my questions are stupid. And I should be asking my model something different, you know, because maybe I should not be interested in the evacuation time. Maybe I should be interested in finding the probability in which a certain chain of events occurs that blocks my evacuation completely. And that's a problem I should solve and not prove for the hundredth time that it takes one hour to walk 30 floors down. So I think the way how this field develops, it opens a lot of doors. But again, I'm not sure if everyone should jump through them already, immediately, because we need to first understand what we want to gain from that. Absolutely. absolutely. And I think you started off there where you made a point, probably like this, crowd psychology wasn't even really kind of acknowledged as such until pretty recently. So I remember, I think it was 2014, I went to the Pedestrian Evacuation Dynamics Conference for the first time. I felt like such an outsider because I was a kind of social psychologist surrounded by amazing mathematicians, computer modelers, but I was the only kind of social psychologist. And I was there presenting work with Isabella von Sievers where we were like, great processes are important and here is how you can start to put them in a model. And we got so many questions about why is this important? Why do we need this? The models are already working. Why isn't these assumptions of crowd behavior accurate? And there was a huge uphill battle to kind of show why this is important. And luckily, crowd psychology has been going from strength to strength, which has made the argument quite easy. But really, you need that dialogue. And I mean, that was the PED in 2014. This year, I gave a keynote at the PED about group processes. And I never would have imagined that. Granted, it's because they were trying to like foreground early career researchers. But I never would have thought that would happen back in 2014. So it shows how far we've come. And I work with movement strategies, with OFR consultants, people in industry who are developing these models and taking them to large stadiums, to large housing complexes across the UK, because they're interested in it. But we are all still collectively puzzling out, how do we apply this? What is it we actually want to gain from these models? What do we want to know about group processes? And so on one hand i think that from crowd psychology we can inform these models so much but also i've learned so much from these conversations and they've opened up so many questions that i hadn't thought of in ways to research group processes new methodologies for, virtual reality. So all these new methodologies, I think, are really informing the shape that crowd psychology has taken and the direction that it's taking. One thing I've been trying to do when looking at, OK, what do we actually want to do in this model and how do group processes impact it, is thinking about what our key outcomes are. So whether that is evacuation time or if it is thinking about what our kind of key outcomes are so whether that is evacuation time right or if it is response time from getting information and working out how we where group processes might fit into that in terms of theory and building experiments to manipulate it so in the experiments we have kind of behavioral outcomes of evacuation time of response time that can then inform the models so it's really working out okay okay, what does this discipline do? Like an evacuation behavior, what are the kind of key bits that are important to them? How can we work together? Like how can we inform each other? And there's a lot to do, but it's a really exciting time to be doing it. I think if I reverse what I've said previously, what can you get from a current model, which has a pre-evacuation time distribution, a simple agent movement Q formation model? In the end, what I've said, the time you've waited to exit, the total evacuation time, the capacity of your stairwell, that's it. You can't get anything further from it. And it's not that you can improve that model by adding one simple, small submodel and it will solve and suddenly give you an insight. I think when you step into crowd psychology, like you need to implement almost the whole thing, otherwise it doesn't make sense. But then you get the capability of understanding, not just finding an answer, which is a number. And when you understand what's happening, what are the challenges with your building, you can take informed design decisions. You can design procedures for the building. And I think we're doing a really great job in that today, you know, designing procedures for buildings. I think we're doing a really great job in that today, you know, designing procedures for buildings. And in the end, if, you know, if I design a smoke control system in an atrium or whatever, and I tell you it's going to give you 10 minutes evacuation time, for me to go to like 12 or 15 minutes is usually a huge redesign with a large investment cost. But if you understand the crowd psychology in your building and you could act to limit the time required to escape from 12 minutes to 10 minutes, maybe you are way more efficient than I am in spending the money on safety of the building. And this can be a feature of safety of the building. So I see the use of this field, absolutely. I think that what we see again and again in emergencies from cross-psychology is that the public can be an amazing resource for good. They're so good at sharing information, sharing resources, supporting each other. I don't know what the best way is to harness that other than to make sure they have the resources and knowledge needed to do it well. And I think more work is needed to do that. So I also I don't want to say that the current models, those kind of evacuation models aren't working because they are. They clearly are. You have some really, really great models out there that can predict behavior really well. really great models out there that can predict behavior really well. But if we want to make them even better for the sake of safety planning, if we're saying that group processes keep impacting this behavior, we should be modeling them as well. That's my main argument, is that we're doing well, but we can keep doing even better if we get more knowledge. I'm here also close to the world of buildings, but the world of crowd modeling is much, much larger. Large outdoor events, wildfire evacuation. I guess these are also the fields where this group behavior may actually be even stronger. I mean, let's go wildfire. You have families that would escape together. You have neighbors who would be escaping together. I think these bonds could be even stronger than your floor in your office, right? I wonder. I think it's an interesting question. One thing I've found with high-rise buildings is that you can't always see how everyone else is reacting. Because you're on different floors, you might have a different layout. And so people will go and seek others to see how they're reacting on the other hand if you have something like an attack on a busy street a busy city street you can see how everyone's responding on that street it's really really clear right and i think there might be, this is an interesting research question for future, is the extent to which you can see others reacting and how much you feel like they're part of the group, how that then impacts response. So I think for me, it doesn't matter what group people are in, if they feel like part of a group, we see this kind of heightened trust of those people in the group, going to them for information. But there is something there in interaction with the kind of physical environment and their ability to do that. I think that's something interesting. So something I've kind of been keeping in mind, especially as I've been moving to these high-rise building evacuations, I don't have a concrete answer, but those are my kind of initial speculations. I would take it even further. I feel that what really interests me personally is tunnels, road tunnels, and how to make people leave their vehicle and escape a tunnel. That's, I think, a hell of an issue, which I don't have a really great answer to. Also, maybe crowd psychology could help us understanding the collective behavior of drivers in a tunnel and how to reach them, especially in a situation where you would like to evacuate people who do not see a fire, you know, that sometimes happens. If you have a very long tunnel, the drivers can stop far away from the fire and they don't even know they're under the threat, the wreck threat, and you would like them to leave the vehicle and go away. I think that self-relevance of the threat is really important and that perception of is this immediate threat or not, I think is key. What we see in cross-psychology is when there's that perception of the threat and the common fate, that's where we see the collective behavior kick in. But if people don't see it as self-relevant they don't see it as affecting them you might see that that connection to the others may not be happening i know there's been great work done in tunnels about types of signage and how visible it is and how much that influences others one thing that comes to mind it's used the example of or you've been talking about quite a lot but i think it's a great example is in the london bombings that was in a tunnel people were stuck between stations it was dark they couldn't see what was going on and they were helping each other to evacuate they were going like taking people out towards the platforms going back in helping others because they felt that everyone was in the same boat that they didn't know if another bomb was going to go off, emergency services couldn't get in. It was very much, we are under threat right now, and so how do we help each other to get out? In something like a tunnel, if you can't see the fire, I think that's a very different situation, because the threat isn't necessarily present at that exact time, unless you have a way of communicating why it's a threat and what to do. Yeah, we are designing both alarm systems for tunnels now. So it gives a direct line of communication between the center of operations and the tunnel up to a level where you can call people by a gentleman in a red shirt, please evacuate, that's kind of helpful. Yeah. But yeah, thank you. That is food for thought that's really good and i hope that your field grows and and develops and it leads us to much better models in in pedestrian dynamics maybe you want to share some resources or tell the audience the next step to to learn more about this absolutely so i'm going to tell you this is a shameless plug for my website. Yeah, yeah. A little price to pay for a great guest in a podcast. I just made it, and this is so exciting to me that I have a website. It's identities and collective behavior. So I'm updating that with lots of resources and work. We publish work. My students are doing talks and things like that that have been recorded that are all available if you want to learn more. There are so many fantastic researchers in crowd psychology, like Selin Tekken Govan has done great work on communities in Grenfell in the aftermath of the emergency and how they came together to support each other. Sada Visteragin has done fantastic work on collective action, if you're interested in that, in crowd psychology. Chris Deregan has done fantastic work on collective action, if you're interested in that, in crowd psychology. John Drury has led a really game-changing team of researchers at the University of Sussex, who are doing all sorts of stuff in crowd psychology, particularly in evacuation research. If you're interested in his, look at his work. Chris Cocking has done a ton of work with emergency services, looking at their interactions with the crowd in the public in emergencies. Holly Carter at Public Health England has done a load of work with emergency services, looking at their interactions with the crowd in the public in emergencies. Holly Carter at Public Health England has done a load of work with emergency services and those communication approaches, how they impact behavior. Steve Reischer has been present. I will just keep naming names, but there are so many people. I'm taking notes. That is really, really, really great. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming to the podcast. It was a joy to have you here. And I hope many people are now more open to crowd psychology and more informed about the role of social science in fire. And I think it is profound. Thanks so much for coming. Thank you so much for the invitation. I have thoroughly enjoyed this great conversation. So thank you so much for the invitation i have thoroughly enjoyed this great conversation so thank you so much for the invitation and that's it your crush curse into the world of social psychology and crowd behavior i hope you've enjoyed it as mentioned in the intro and by ann there's a web page where she collects all her research and publication resources to share. It's identitiesandcollectivebehavior.com. And I've checked it. It's really good. You should try it as well if anything in this episode was interesting to you. My takeaways are that group behavior can be completely different than single person behavior. And once we start modeling or seeing them in the groups, the crowd behaves in a slightly different way. It doesn't mean it's worse. It doesn't mean it's dangerous. It doesn't mean our models do not work. But it's just different. And this difference can be assessed on a path to better modeling. And I think that's a good takeaway. There are phenomena that we omit on purpose, And I think that's a good takeaway. There are phenomena that we omit on purpose, which we may actually try to understand a model to get our models better. As I've said in the episode, it's maybe not the models that are not sufficient. Maybe our questions are stupid. Maybe we should form our problems related to evacuation better. And I think as the crowd psychology field develops, as social sciences improve in fire safety, we'll have better and better models to understand the behavior of people in fires and truly assess their safety and draw the best ways to help them out in this horrible situation. Anyway, that is it for today. I hope you have enjoyed this episode. And the next one, as usual, waiting for you next Wednesday. See you there. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
