 Welcome to episode 50 of Fireside Show. My name is Guillermo Reyn and I am taking over the podcast today. This is an important episode for three reasons. One is because it's number 50. It's a number to celebrate. It's a long series of episodes. It's really good. Second is because Boje is not going to interview anyone today. That's unusual in a podcast that he created that he has been doing every week interviewing people, is because it's going to be me who is going to interview someone. And the third surprise is that I am going to interview Bocce. So he is going to be talking to you, but instead of extracting information from others and making them talk, it is going to be the other way around. He is going to be talking to us. He's going to be sharing his lessons, his experiences, and his messages. So this is an episode that is important in a podcast series that is important. And Boye tells me that he's super happy to know that about 25,000 downloads of the episodes have happened. On average, 500 downloads per episode. He's really, really happy about this and keeps growing. And I just wish him the best and that this keeps in this direction. Hopefully the interview of the creator helps to cement further the growth of the series. So Bocci is going to talk to us about a specific topic. He is, as you will listen to in the interview, he's a Renaissance person. He does everything. And when he does something, he does it really well, actually. So of the topics, I decided to ask him about one thing that he's very well known because he got awards and really good papers, which is in the modeling, computational modeling of fire and wind. The two of them have massive interactions, as Voyo will tell you. And when they interact, they make the problem of modeling more interesting and more challenging. they make the problem of modeling more interesting and more challenging. This is one of the messages he has for the community, especially for the younger ones, is that people should not be put off by the complexity of combining wind and fire, that they should endure that difficulty. It's challenging. He's telling us, be aware it's challenging. He knows that it's challenging, but it's also rewarding, and it is important. And as an engineer, he himself can tell us about many solutions to safety that he has found by not shying away from wind, but by embracing wind and coupling it with fire. There is a lot to learn from Bolle, the scientist, and Bolle, the engineer. And just that, and then I will just let you listen to what he has to say. let you listen to what he has to say. Welcome to the Farsign show. My name is Guillermo So, Bocce, I am delighted to be here with you. I'm delighted that you are finally being interviewed. You've interviewed so many people, 49 people, I think, or 48. You have an incredible good taste in choosing topics and people. That's, I think, part of the massive success of the podcast. But the most important thing is your ability to have amazing conversations with multiple different personalities. That says a lot about you. We adore you. We need you. And we want your show to keep going for a long time. So I'm very happy to give a grain of sand and to be the one interviewing you today. Thank you. Thank you so much, man. It's so, I mean, it's the same seat, but it feels much different. I'm very happy and thanks for all the kind words. And I'm happy to finally be able to share some of my own research at the ITV. That makes me very happy. What did you pick? Excellent. So you could be interviewed about many different topics. You are a renaissance man. You have multiple interests, so in the podcast, but you have multiple contributions in different topics. I think that definitely is going to be modeling, although you are very good with experiments as well. Thanks. And within modeling, obviously fire, because it's a topic of the podcast, but you have this really interesting and early contribution on fire and wind modeling, the two of them. So it's computational fluid mechanics, not just a fire, but of wind, which is an interface, right? So can you tell us a little bit of how you end up working on this topic? Yeah, thanks, man. Thanks for picking this. It's very near to my heart. It started somewhere in like 2012, 13. I was not really a scientist back then. I was a consultant and we were doing modeling for buildings. And we ended up having this project in the middle of the Warsaw, Hala Koszyki Center. We celebrated the first Obora in that particular building. And it was an old historical shopping mall inside of the town that was to be refurbished. And because it was a historical mall, to remove the smoke from it, the only choice you had were rows of windows that were underneath the roof. That was the only way you could extract smoke from there. I remember seeing those. Yeah, and because these windows are known for being very inefficient for smoke removal in wind conditions, my colleagues, Grzegorz Krajewski and Grzegorz Starbawa, have started doing modeling for that building to establish how efficient the ventilation is in it. And Grzegorz Starbawa back then was doing his PhD on wind influence on tunnels. It was very interesting. So they've applied a lot of knowledge they got so far. They ended up modeling a big part of the city. This is where I came into the project because I helped them build the models and run them. And it was like so interesting, such an interesting case study where you would actually model the wind to truly answer the question, will it interfere with the smoke control or not? And I think it was very surprising to me to find such a rich interaction inside. It was not a simple yes, no, it does interfere, it does not. You could see how the flows from different streets would create a completely different performance of the system. It was just fascinating. And we've published many studies about that building that are available online. I think it was a very nice case study. And since then, I've started playing with it. I've built some models. I've made some buildings, started pushing wind on them, rotating them, seeing what happens. And the answer was never, never simple. And then fast forward a few years, we go into some conferences. We talk with people about the projects. And because we had no idea how to deal with this wind project, we had to use best practices of wind engineering. And for us, it was kind of obvious you do it like that. And then you meet fire people. Sorry for calling you guys fire people. But then you meet fire people and they're doing it completely other way in what seems to wind engineers as a wrong way. And you get into discussions and you realize that it's not that simple. It's not such an easy thing to actually perform these studies together in a way that is scientifically justified, that you control the uncertainty, that you actually model wind. And this is when we decided that maybe because there are no good practice guidelines, I thought it might be a good idea to write once. And yeah, it took three years, but it was worth it. It ended up in fire technology, ended up being a quite well-received paper. And that was the entrance to the beautiful world of wind and fire. Thank you for mentioning the paper. I have it in front of me. It's a two-part paper. It's an absolutely beautiful paper. I just really, I read it again for this interview. And again, I was like, oh, wow, it is as good as I remember, even better. It's part two, right? So it has part one and part two. And actually, you got a Best Paper Award. Yeah, thanks. Thank you. Do you want to tell us a little bit about that experience? Oh, I was so surprised. I mean, as a young scientist, you know, there are many of these awards where you battle with other young scientists. And it's fun. It's fun to get these awards. But BeagleStone Award, you battle with dinosaurs and the best of the best. So I was never thinking that this contribution could actually become the best paper of the year. And it was fantastic. It opened the whole world of possibilities for us because we suddenly could say that the work is important to the community, that it is received by the community and we had to prove that it is important, you know? So for a young scientist, a thing like that, it's life-changing, man. I think it's like you mentioned, ERC was life-changing for you. Maybe not on the same scale, but, you know, that's a similar thing. It truly changes, not who you are, because we're doing the same things with the same scrutiny, same tools, but suddenly many, many more doors open than there were open before. So I really appreciate the editorial board of Fire Technology for choosing this paper as the best paper of that year. And truly there was so much work put into that paper. And it was a little long-ish. Sorry for that. Well, that's why it's two parts, right? No, but congratulations. I think this is a success story. You might actually want to write, you could offer a talk to young academics and young researchers about the success story of a topic that you push forward, a topic that probably at the beginning people were saying is not needed. You don't have to write about this, Bochy. And then you did it, and then you end up with a beautiful paper and an award and an interview in a famous podcast. Fantastic. So part one of this paper is a literature review. Yeah. And I really like, I literally literally you literally scan the horizon i realize is you go high altitude and then you start going lower altitude into the details can you tell us a little bit about the structure of why do you choose this you have six parts in the literature review can you tell us about we go all the way from modeling the flows inside the buildings we're modeling the the ventilators and let's say the interface between the building and exterior. We go into tunnels because that's an interesting twist in the problem. And in the end, we move outside the building into wildfires and urban interface areas and then just dispersion of the smoke in the urban scale. Because wind is a phenomenon that interferes with fire at every scale. And I thought, I always, you know, I come from the ventilator business. So my interface is the ventilator. ventilator business. So my interface is the ventilator. The smoke removal devices in the buildings, like the dampers and everything you use to remove the smoke. This is my core business. For use now, it's a little wider. But for us, wind is just a resistance. The damper subject to a wind has worse performance than when it's not subject to wind. And after my studies, starting with the Harakoshiki and then other studies, I immediately realized this is bullshit. This doesn't make sense. Okay, if you just consider a single ventilator, it makes sense. The wind is resistance. But when you place that vent on a roof, and the roof has beautiful pressure pattern on it. Some part is negative, some part is positive. It's so complex when you put the wind on the building facade, where it can push air or it can block air from coming out of the building. This ventilator will work in a completely different way. It will give completely different parameters of its performance. So narrowing down to this single thing being a vent made we understood the problem completely wrong. We understood it just for the vent, not for the fire safety. And the same goes for a building. If you just model the building in isolation, standing there in an empty space or just put some inlets around it, say it has this dynamic pressure, this is the wind that acts on it, what you do is you're essentially exposing the building to a certain value of pressure, but not wind. Wind is a complex phenomenon. I always joke that, you know, imagine if we took the complex phenomenon as a fire and just replaced it with a simple time-temperature relation. How stupid would that be? Lame. But that's what we as fire scientists try to do with wind. We don't appreciate the complexity of the phenomenon. And with this complexity comes diversity of outcomes of the wind effects. So this is why we thought in the review paper, we cannot just tell people the story about the buildings. We cannot just tell the story about the ventilators. We need to try and find out what the fire community at whole has learned about wind. And there were reviews by Pitts from NIST about war fires, which was amazing. It was a fantastic resource on wind and fire interaction on the city scale. We found brilliant papers about firebrands or dynamics. They are so rich in knowledge about wind. We went into fire worlds. That's another fascinating phenomenon. So we thought, okay, if we want to give it the justice, if we want the fire community to be exposed to how wind is done and how one should include wind in their analysis, we need to give a broad view on the subject because it is much more rich than most people would think. I hope I can do it in like three pages, but no, it was a whole 80,000 character paper about this, and we still have not probably captured all the knowledge that was there. Thank you for talking about the ventilators and the buildings. You touched many beautiful problems. One of them that I invite you to say more about now, if you want, is tunnels. You're looking to wind and tunnels and fires. Oh, yeah. We just recently had commissioned a tunnel in Warsaw, a very big road tunnel. We've spent almost half a year in that tunnel. And one of the main questions was, how does wind affect the flows inside the tunnel? And it sounds like a simple question, but to answer that, you need to answer what do you mean by wind? You know, that's a fundamental question. What is wind? Like, wind has a velocity. It has gusts because it's not just a constant flow of air. It's huge vortices that move around your region. You sometimes have high velocities, sometimes have low velocities. So it's very complicated. But first, you have velocity. So there's a certain probability associated with different velocities. Should we design a tunnel for a hurricane, which doesn't happen in Poland? No, it doesn't happen. or a hurricane, which don't happen in Poland. No, it doesn't happen. So you need to figure out for what wind velocity would you like to design your tunnel. And the action of each of these velocities will be different. But to make it even more complicated, wind has a direction component to it. One thing, when you mention wind and tunnels, you really mean the wind outside the tunnel and how it alters the inside. But the inside itself is not wind, right? That's what you mean. Inside you have some flow that is induced by the wind, but the wind action outside, it creates this, some of the pressure, dynamic pressure of the wind creates the flow. Yeah, because it changes the boundary conditions of the portal. And this is something, it's fascinating because not many people actually look into this. Many people look into the modeling of the flows inside a tunnel, but very few people look into the effect of fluid mechanics at the portals. I tell you, this is the issue we also felt into because we've designed this system in 2015 for this tunnel, Because we've designed this system in 2015 for this tunnel, and we went with the best knowledge of the time, and we didn't really consider wind that much as a factor or not as such a dynamic factor as now. In this tunnel, it had transversal ventilation system. We really wanted to have low velocity in the tunnel, around 1.5 meters per second. That was our design goal. And the wind could create a flow of four or five meters in the tunnel easily on its own. We had an array of jet fans in the tunnel that could be used to stop the wind. But if we start all of them together and there is no wind, then the jet fans will create this overwhelming force. So we needed to find a balance between the wind and the jet fans in the tunnel. And that led to design of 688 different scenarios of operation of the tunnel for different velocities of the wind outside and different wind direction angles. And only then we could say, okay, no matter what wind is outside the system if it triggers in the correct scenario it will stop the winds to more or less the level we needed and and so this was probably the the most difficult wind fire interaction i've done in my career and this was not modeling we had the tunnel we had the measurements we had the weather station we could i'll tell you a story. It was like a Saturday. It's like 9 p.m. The children are going to sleep. And I am dressing up, packing up. My wife is asking me, where are you going? And I'm like, I need to go to the tunnel. But why? I need to measure the velocity in the tunnel. Now, cannot someone else do it? No, I've called them. No one is there. I need to go there to measure. But why do you need that? There is very rare wind occurring now. My wife is like, what wind is occurring? I'm sorry. It was like because we had very, very rare southern wind with velocity above six meters per second and I really needed to go to the tunnel to get this data point because I missed it. to go to the tunnel to get this data point because I missed it. We never had that when we really missed it. And I packed my anemometer. I ran into the tunnel. I've measured the thing. The guys from security were looking at me like, what are you doing here in the nights? But I took the point and it really helped me solve the issue because we found the missing points that connected many others together. And we finally had this full circle and a full understanding, comprehension of how wind will affect the tunnel. But, Guillermo, imagine a tunnel. That's a pipe. It has two openings. And we end up with almost 700 different scenarios. And each of them is completely different. And now imagine a building, a skyscraper, which has endless amount of openings. The tunnel is simple. It's in the ground. The skyscraper can be 500 meters up in the troposphere, escaping the lowest atmospheric boundary layer. How complicated it is then. And in fire, how we deal with problems we don't understand, we omit them. That was not a choice we thought is viable. We wanted to understand it. We're still not there, but on the route. And tunnels are a great example of what you can learn by touching wind, especially if it's a rare wind. You're making a very good case for the importance of wind, that sometimes it can help in the smoke movement and in the fire movement, and sometimes it cannot. So you're already alluding to this. So what do you propose as an engineer? Obviously, you are not proposing that this is ignored, as most cases have happened to date. Are you proposing to focus on the worst case scenario or proposing a probabilistic approach? I mean, you're mentioning multiple scenarios so tell us more about what you propose of how an engineer can deal with this scientific ability to study interactions of wind smoke and fire yeah this is a very good question and and a very difficult one to answer obviously as you mentioned this is's complicated. There are hundreds of scenarios. I mean, even probabilistic would be too expensive in most cases. So it. And the goal of this grant is to solve that completely for a single building in a single location of the town. We choose an open car park because this is a very interesting case study where the wind can truly have the tremendous impact over the course of the fire. And it will require from what we establish at the moment, somewhere between 1,000 to maybe 4,000 different scenarios to completely have a complete view on different fires and winds, how they interact and what are the outcomes. This is only once to be done. We really want to understand the complete image. But from previous case studies, we had case studies in which we did, let's say, 2 meters per second, 5 meters per second, 10 meters per second average wind velocity. And in this case studies, we found the middle one to give the worst results. The strongest winds would actually give better results than the lowest one. And that was really surprising, you know, because suddenly, okay, so we don't have the worst win. Like this is uncomfortable for me. I always thought the stronger, the worse. I just picked the strongest reasonable win you have and you're good. But no, this case study shown it's not the case. It's complicated. So essentially you enter a problem that's potentially not possible to solve. But when writing these review papers that were mentioned, we also figured out that, okay, let's go to building. When does the wind affect the building fire? When it becomes its boundary condition, like you mentioned, the wind becoming a boundary of the portals. So maybe we can have a cheaper way to establish in which wind scenario it is likely to be the worst boundary condition. And then once we determine these scenarios, you go into full wind and fire simulations, which are expensive. Because if you simulate just wind, no fire, you can run it as a steady state problem. It is not as computationally expensive. I can do 20, 30, 50 simulations of just wind. At the time, I would do one wind and fire study. So you can actually do hundreds of wind scenarios of your building that you're interested in. And that they're mine, in which scenarios you have obtained the biggest pressure rise on the inlets or outlets, when there was the highest under pressure on your vents, you know, just investigate the pressure on the building, in which scenarios you had the most extreme values of these pressures. And they usually would correspond to the scenarios in which the wind-fire interaction would be the strongest in your fire case. Especially when you have, for example, overpressure on your exhaust vents. This is when the wind will block the smoke inside the building and will not allow it to escape. So this is definitely the worst case. And by this, you can narrow down from hundreds of scenarios to be investigated into a number that is manageable by the engineer, and then focus on this particular scenario. This is how we solve the Halakoshiki problem. We narrow it down into the ones that are most likely to be problematic and then solve for them and see what happens. And I think at this stage, this is probably the best you can do. It's not easy. It is not needed for all projects for sure. But when you need an answer, it's the best way you can find one. Perfect. Thank you, Roger. And you have already alluded to wildfires, but because wildfires is such an up-and-coming fire phenomenon where there's a lot of needs for solutions, and you yourself have interviewed Michael Goldner and Sarah McAllister and Catalina Stoof. But in your 2018 paper, this paper that we're referring to, you actually went and reviewed the literature of wildfires and wind modeling. You want to tell us about this? That was one of the parts that I enjoyed the most. That makes me happy. You have an amazing sketch. You're really good with sketches and drawings and you have a particularly good one. I mean, for us it was probably the most difficult one to write, you know, because we're not wildfire experts and we were worried that we may omit something critical for for a wildfire community. And in this particular chapter, we got help from Mike Oler and Ali Tahidi, who were kind enough to refer us to some studies about wind and fire that has been done in that community. And I think it is, even if you go back to Rothermel's model, wind is a factor in there. Essential factor, one of the three most important factors. And you don't have to be a fire scientist to understand that wind influences wildfires and how they spread. So definitely, it was a parallel field to the building fire science that had its own take in fires. However, I think the problem is slightly different than building. In wildfires, I think the wind, if you could oversimplify the case, like the wildfire case, the wildfire is like a boundary layer problem. You know, that forest will be essentially a roughness boundary condition on your ground. It will influence how the flow is changing in this boundary layer. But in general, it will not change the structure of the wind so much. Where in the city, this is something that was the most scary finding of our work. In city, this concept doesn't really work that well. You cannot put an isolated building and just mimic the city with the roughness criterion and just pretend you're doing wind there, because the array of streets in the city will create a completely individual flow path around your building. In that case study that I've mentioned just before, when we found that the middle velocity was the worst one, we also found that the building was a rectangular building, and it had an opening on a shorter wall. So we thought, okay, if we blow directly to that door, it will be definitely the worst case. And it was not. The worst case was when the wind was like 45 degrees to the right, and the wind was like hitting a building nearby, running around that building and hitting our door. That was the worst case because of the complexity of the system in there. So here, even though we're talking about wind, it's the same thing. I think the problems we face and the wildfire community phase is completely different in terms of what is needed. And in the wildfire community, I think what's the most beautiful thing is they truly do forecasting. They work to forecast how fires will grow, where will they go, Where will the smoke go? How will it spread? And they do something we never do in buildings. They measure the wind and try to incorporate that measurement in their forecasts, in their reduced order models. And for me, this was absolutely mind-blowing how beautiful these solutions can be. In our case, you have to make up the wind, you know, you have to have this logarithmic wind profile, you have to make up completely based on science, obviously, but you make it up. And here they deal with something they truly measure. And it's something that you can, like, the closer you are to the forecast, the more, you know, the more accurate it should be. You mean that because wildfires happen on very large timescales, they will be spreading for days. You are saying that they can measure the wind profile in real time and then do a prediction? They can incorporate the momentary meteorological data in their analysis to refine their forecasts. And for buildings, you don't have a building model readily available when the fire is ongoing, not to mention meteorological data. So I think only for the biggest, most difficult fires, you would go into any sort of modeling of a fire during a fire. While in wildfires, I think this simpler model, because it's not only CFD, you can use Eulerian models, you can use Lagrangian models. There is, I mean, even simple Gaussian dispersion or puff models are being used to forecast. I actually was very happy to write a chapter on that for Brian Mitchum's handbook and Margaret McNamee's handbook that's coming up soon-ish, I hope, where we go in-depth in how we can model this wind and smoke interaction. And I think in the wildfire community, the wind is maybe even more essential than it is for us. However, I think the solution may be a little easier than for us, Maybe a little easier than for us, because for us, these specific flow paths of city wind is something that can drive your fire behavior. And that's unfortunate because it makes the problem so much more complex than just, you know, a simple boundary condition. Thank you, Boje. You're such a Renaissance man. Conf confirmed also in the interview. In the Renaissance, you would die for forecasting weather, so that's not great, you know. Following the structure of your paper, in part two, you go beyond the literature review, and you go into something which is very nice and very rarely done in science. You actually provide a best practice guidance. This is amazing, and I encourage all engineers in the field to take a look at a leader in the topic is actually saying what he has learned and he's sharing the lessons and the hints. So in that, in part two, you literally, we could be talking about this for days. Let's try to make it just the podcast episode. So, for example, you talk about a topic that is really important in modeling in CFD, is the discretization. And do you want to tell us about the importance of discretization in the specifics of when you are doing fire, smoke, and wind? Yeah, this was a huge challenge for us. And my co-author, Toma Klipeckky, who actually should have mentioned him in the start because this was a two-man or at some point three-man work with Grzegorz Koleski. But Tomek has done immense work on this review along with me, and it was a huge pleasure to work with him on this. And we're still working together on wind and fire. So, so high five to Tomek. Tomek was a researcher, did not do any fire. He's a wind engineer, but he did a lot of work on scaffoldings around buildings. And finally, the issues in discretization of space, when you model scaffoldings and model fire, are seemingly the same. Because you have this tiny thing that is inside your building or around your building. For him, it's a scaffolding. For me, it's the scale at which the fire phenomena happen. So it's in the centimeters, let's say. And you have wind. And you can't really do a centimeter mesh when you're modeling 2 by 2 kilometer large domain. In wind engineering, you would go to 15, 25 meter cells. That's not very odd that you go into such cell dimensions. Whereas in fire, you would like to use relatively small meshes. We tend to use 10, 5, 20 centimeters based on D star, which is not a measure of mesh quality, by the way. I always feel horrible when I see people justify their mesh choice by that. Regardless, we use meshes in centimeters, whereas in fires you would use meters. You mean centimeters in fire, whereas it would be meters in wind? Yeah, centimeters in fire, whereas it would be meters in wind? Yeah, centimeters in fire, and whereas it would be meters in wind. And you know, this tiny detail, I mean, what is the consequence of that? Well, first of all, in wind, you would run steady state simulations, like I mentioned before, or some sort of periodic simulation, so you would measure, like, 20 seconds of the flow, and you assume that it periodically repeats. So this is how you would measure like 20 seconds of the flow and you assume that it periodically repeats. So this is how you would model wind. In fire, in practical engineering, we model asset-asset time. We need to know the fire development. You need 20 minutes of the fire, what will happen, how it will change over time. So suddenly you're talking about a completely different simulation. That's why I mentioned I can do 50 wind simulations when I can do one wind fire simulation. Because for that reason, I need to model my fire on a transient scale. And now, the size of your mesh, if you use FDS, that does not only dictate your spatial resolution, it dictates your time step because of current predicts level criterion that is used in FDS. So changing the mesh, you change the time step of your simulation. You're adding iterations to your simulation by having a finer mesh. So it quickly becomes a very complicated matter that dictates if you're able to solve it or not. Because often when people receive a CFD that will last a week or longer, they just give up. They rarely pursue such simulations. And I hate it when I see a paper, we have to use a really horrible mesh because my laptop is not strong enough. This is not how science is done. Like, you know, imagine CERN said, yeah, we think this particle exists, but we cannot confirm because the accelerator is just bad and we cannot afford a better one. That's a restraint you have to work around, but not something you can justify a choice with. So the choice of mesh is really horrible. And I think in this paper, I'm highly inspired by Bert Blokken. He's a leading scientist in the field of wind engineering and field of sports aerodynamics. And Bert, he was a pioneer who were doing this best practice guidelines for wind. And this is what inspired us. And he showed very practical solutions to problems. You know, they've run case studies. They said, OK, this mesh is sufficient. This is not. This is how you should build it. This is the most efficient way you could do it. And we wanted to transfer it into fire. The thing that I think is quite surprising for fire people, for us, is that it's not sufficient to just make the mesh. You have to measure the quality. And this is something I'm missing in many modeling studies. People just choose and assume it's going to work, but in wind, you have to measure. You have to provide some metrics that this mesh is good. The best is if you go convergence study and see how a change in a mesh affects your outcomes, but that in fire is something that's very difficult to obtain because many solvers do not really converge with. Better mesh does not necessarily mean a better solution in FHIR. And they have these metrics for like turbulence, Y+, the scales of analysis. I found it really interesting that such metrics can be used and I wanted to expose the FHIR community that, wait guys, the mesh is an important thing. Let's measure, let's check it out before we go into modeling. There's many more of these best practice things in the paper, for sure. Yeah, that's key. You're describing the problem rightly so as a multi-scale problem where you have two phenomena of importance, the fire, the wind, and each of them have different temporal and spatial scales. And as a modeler, you need to do both. You cannot choose one or the other. You have to do both. You're absolutely right. I really like it how you emphasize how many people drop the wind when they try to do this and they're not just doing fire, maybe not for the best reasons, just because of the difficulty of the task, which means that the people who do it, like you, must be celebrated and highlighted because this is their way forward. You know, when we went into this Opus grant, when we submitted that we want to study wind and fire interaction, we didn't just go that we want to see if a car park will burn worse than when there's wind or when there's no wind. We wanted to understand the consequences of low to mid-velocity winds on fire, on smoke, to be able to give this better informed engineering judgment when we go into something like field experiments. You would often see in papers from fire experiments that our wind was moderate up to like five meters per second. So we assumed it has no effect on fire. Whereas we don't know. We have no idea if it had or not. No one has ever done it in a parametric study. So we have no idea what is the consequence of low velocity wind. And from the initial work we've done, we've seen these consequences. We've seen that one or two meters per second wind can already change things a lot. And that's disturbing because that means every wind can. It's very rare that you would have wind conditions that would not affect you at all. When you do fire experiments in a laboratory, if you take my laboratory and you do the experiment with a wooden building that I'm currently burning like the ninth time, if you show me the picture of that fire plume, I can tell you which doors were open, you know, based on the shape of the plume. This is how often fragile fire is to external conditions. And wind is overwhelmingly there. It's always there. It is not a condition that appears and disappears. It's just there in the background. And if we want to understand what are the consequences of it being there, and I don't mean that it invalidates the data or something. I just mean you need to know the uncertainty. I had Francesco here last week and you seem to terrorize him about uncertainties and he's really good at them now. But this is important, you know, know your uncertainties and that gives you a better way to understand what you have done, right? Thank you. You are picturing a truly fascinating problem, multi-scale complex problem, where the worst-case scenario is far from evident, which I think is very interesting because obviously in engineering, focusing on the worst-case scenario is a tradition of itself, not the only one. But when the worst-case scenario cannot be found, that is a good justification to invest into wind modeling then. Excellent. So following on the multi-scale and the complexities of combining fire and wind, and one thing that wind and fire have in common, one that definitely they do, is that they are never laminar. The two of them are always turbulent. So good. So you are definitely going to be including turbulence in your model. But which model of turbulence and which model of combustion? Oh, that's a tough one. That's really a tough one. I like this philosophy that we need to understand physics to remove it from our modeling, you know. I think Jose said something like that in Princeton lectures. And for combustion, for example, what is the added value of modeling combustion when I model a fire in my building where I predefine the heat of combustion of my sample, I predefine the total heat release rate, and I predefined soothills. Also, I predefined what amount of heat I generate, I predefined what amount of smoke I generate, and by my model, I give it geometrical constraints where it will burn. It will just tell you where the flame is. Yeah, just adding combustion to this, it's like the same thing, but with additional steps in the meantime, which you have paid for. So if I do predefine everything there, I don't need combustion to do that. I would need combustion if I wanted to know the oxygen concentration around, or I would like to know where the flame is, or I would leave the soot generation to be dictated by the physics model, or I would like to know rate of reactions, or I would have underventilated fire, and I would like to understand if wind pushing on the small holes in the room can give sufficient oxygen or not, then sure, I would model combustion. But when I'm doing a simulation like that, I cannot model, like I can model combustion, but it's just a fancy thing that gives me not that much and costs me a lot. And with turbulence, it's the same. So you would have two typical ways to model turbulence in your flows. When the air flows, it's giant vortices of air that are constantly spinning, that are moving around, dissipating into thinner and thinner ones until, like, there is, at the Kolomogorov scale, there is none left. So that's turbulence. And someone defined it like turbulence is like pornography, you know, when you see it. And you know what it is. So it's very difficult to define. But you have to model that, the way how air moves. And there are two ways you can do it. You either average it over time, which we do with Reynolds average Navier-Stokes equations models, or you average in space and you solve for the movement in time, which is used in large-edged simulation that is the backbone of FDS, for example. The averaging in time approach is very efficient because you can go for very long time steps, like one-tenth of a second, maybe even more, where you just assume that the flow happens in space. You know the average velocity. You know the turbulence intensity, so how turbulent the flow was. And you know the dissipation rate, so how these larger vortices shed smaller ones and how this energy spreads around. So this gives the solver a way to solve the momentum equation and give you a final flow field, which is averaged in time. So when you take a picture of a fire in this model averaged in time, you don't see a beautiful fire. You see like a cone or something with the different values, different gradient of velocities or temperatures inside. So that's one way. And this is very time efficient. The only thing it cannot give you is the momentary value. And I've already mentioned before that wind is gusts, which can be much higher than the average velocity. So there's absolutely no way you can capture this with RANS modeling. You can to some sort the biggest vortices because you see them forming with this solution, especially if you go into very complex models like Reynolds stress model. Then you have many more equations for every direction, how this dissipation happens. You can capture, but not perfectly. In LES modeling, you do the opposite. You understand that there are multiple sizes of these vertices in the world. And you understand that the big ones are the important ones because they move the air around. And the tiny ones are not that much important. They just like swirl until they dissipate. And you just cut them. Like I solve the big ones. I forget about the small ones or I solve the small ones with a sub scale model. And that's how FTS works. It solves the big ones, it approximates the tiny ones, and the interface between them is related to the size of your cell. So once again, we go back to the importance of the choice of your grid. Now, this solution is expensive because the time steps have to be very short in order to capture the movement of these beautiful vortices. What you gain for that is that you gain a beautiful image of these flames puffing, smoke moving in vortices. It's much more beautiful when you look at it, and it's much more realistic, and you can capture the gusts in that. when you look at it, and it's much more realistic, and you can capture the gusts in that. But the price you pay is times 10, times 100 of RANS simulation. And it's funny, and we've done that. If you take a LES simulation and you average the results, you get the image like in RANS, you know, because you suddenly time-averaged everything. So the choice of the turbulence is a difficult one. In FHIR, people often make this choice by choosing software. If you choose FTS, you use LES modeling, no other real choice. If you go into Ansys, that's a fun thing because you have to choose. You have to tell, there is no default model. Default is laminar. So you need to choose your model. And to choose, you need to understand. For us, we're usually using either K-epsilon RNG. That's renormalization group, not random number generator. How many people think it doesn't give random turbulence is the name of a group. Or the other one is K-omega SST. And also works quite well for wind problems. So these are the two that would be models of my choice. One day, I would love to use LES for everything, but I cannot afford it now, unfortunately. And what about DNS? Direct Numerical Simulation? Not for wind, I guess. It has been done until, Reynolds' number of few thousand, and many people would use it. Direct numerical simulation means you just solve the neighbor-stokes equations for every scale that is in your analysis, up to the tiniest vortices. The question is, do you need that? The best practices of modeling flows with large eddy simulation, there's this beautiful paper, 10 Questions About LES by Pope. I would highly recommend to anyone who's dealing with flow problems in fire. And somewhere in there, there's a thing that if you solve 80% of the energy within the vortices with LES, with the direct model, and 20% you approximate with subgrid model, you're pretty much good. So essentially, four pieces you're solving directly, one piece is approximated. So your error is not that huge. And that justifies why you don't need DNS. And DNS, I mean, you can do DNS simulations for wind problems, but it's prohibitively expensive. It's just not with today's computers, not reachable. Maybe not necessary, I wonder. I don't think it is. It's a nice validation technique. This is a joy to interview you, because I'm learning and also I'm in vast agreement with the things that you're saying. That's the point of the podcast. You learn so much, man. You are indeed a man of renaissance in modern times. There is a lot of things that you do that I value tremendously. One of them is that you are a scientist and an engineer, something very important for me. Also that you do experiments and you do modeling. I know you have more of a modeling background, but you also are involved in experiments. So in the work that we are discussing today of wind and fire modeling, what is the role that you see to experiments and the topic of validation? That's a good one. You actually once said about us that we are a center for experimental fire science. And I saw that tweet and I was like, oh my God, yeah, that's actually what I want to become. A center for experimental fire science. That sounds so nice. Let's build that up. And we're trying our best to be such a hub. For wind, wind engineering is essentially an experimental field. Almost everything we know about it comes from experiments in wind tunnels. everything we know about it comes from experiments in wind tunnels. So even the best practices for CFD in many cases refer to the best practices of wind tunnel engineering and experiments in wind tunnels, like the blockage ratio you would like, how much of the space in your domain you can block with buildings to make sure that you don't affect the flow inside. So that comes from the tunnel experiment. So that's beautiful. Now, with wind and fire, experimenting is very difficult for two reasons. You either can achieve the scale, so you can go into full scale, and you can achieve full scale fire and include the wind effect in that fire. If you burn a building outdoors, there's wind, you can have wind effects in that experiment. But you do not get to choose the wind, you know. You work with what the nature has given at that particular moment. Or you can go into wind tunnel and you can choose the wind. You have the perfect choice of what wind boundary condition you have, but you have to go into scale fire, which is not a real fire, which is difficult in interpretation. So I think the only people who can do it both are IBHS in US. They break the rules because they have a giant wind tunnel where you can put burning buildings inside. So they broke the law there. It should be prohibited. It's unfair advantage over the rest of us. But these guys can do both. Everyone else on the planet has to either run and fire experiments in whatever wind you find or scale down. And this is very difficult. And in our project, you know, we choose the route of numerical modeling as the fundamental tool of research supported by wind tunnel modeling for validation in terms of pressures on buildings. So we know that we are unable to model wind and fire together, So, we know that we are unable to model wind and fire together, but we want to build a mock-up of the city that we are modeling in a computer in the wind tunnel, run wind experiment in it, and figure out if the pressures on facades are accurate, if the flows are the same in the sea ofN, in the wind tunnel. So it would give us the capability to say, okay, to some sort we have validated the wind model, the wind solution is correct in here. And again, for me as someone who loves to work with full-scale experiments, this is also, as I mentioned, an important thing to understand, to what extent wind you meet on the field impacts your fire experiment and to be able to quantify that in a way or another. That's fun. But yeah, there's definitely a future in experimenting with wind. It's just hard to put fire in there. Unless you're IBHS. Awesome. Thank you, Boje. I do have two more questions for the interview today. I wish we could have a follow-up. Maybe when we have the episode 100, you invite me again to interview you. To clear all the misconceptions that were said in episode 50 and why it's completely different. So the first is, do you have a message for young engineers and young scientists that are entering into the topic of fire and wind? Is there anything that you want to tell them specifically? Not to the old dinosaurs like us, to the younger ones, to the much younger ones. It's complicated, but it shouldn't hold you back from doing it the best you can. The interaction is so rich. There is probably not a single solution for that, you know? It will always be a problem of your architecture, of your wind boundary conditions, of your fire. It will always be something very unique that you find. And it is hard, but it is worth it, I think. I think it gets you on a completely different level of understanding the phenomena you're trying. Especially that wind can be the driving force for many phenomena. I guess that's the first question you should ask yourself. Do I, by the literature study, by the overview of the field, do I think that wind can be the driving force in here. Because if it's not, then maybe it's not worth it. But if there's any chance that win can be a driving force in the thing you're trying, if you omit it, you just omitted the driving force. So that's not a great solution. And you should not omit it to save just omitted the driving force. So that's not a great solution. And you should not omit it to save time or to save computational resources. You never should do that. You should try and use it. And you should also try to see if there are simpler models than, let's say, CFD that we're using that can do both. Like if we go back to the tunnel example that we've discussed, if you wanted to solve that problem with CFD, it would be a very expensive, difficult, and long solution to do. It would be ridiculous to do. We had luck the tunnel was built and we could take measurements and approximate the coefficients for portals with measurements. But with CFD, it would be ridiculous. However, if you wanted to solve the same thing with a simple momentum equation, you know, and put wind as one of the boundaries in the reduced order model, you could do it in one, two days and have really decent solutions. And that's what we did essentially in the end of the test. So it's complicated, but they may be reduced order models that can allow you to solve your issue and understand this holistic problem of wind and fire interaction in your case. And then when you go into finer modeling, maybe you will know when is the driving force and what is not. Then if the driving force is improbable, because that's one in a thousand year hurricane, you can cut it out and you're safe. But you have a proof. Why? If it's a driving force still, then maybe you need to do some experiments, do some modeling, go deeper in it and see to what extent it is influencing your solution. Or if you don't feel like that because it's overwhelming. Because I know you can jump into the loophole which will be overwhelming i mean that's where we jumped and i know what i have went through to achieve my results so it can be an overwhelming loophole but you know there are people there who do that and just open your your mind and collaborate and then like i found my tomac who's the brilliant wind engineer, and he helped me tremendously. You need to find one for yourself. They don't have to be an expert in fire, but they may be an expert in solving your particular problems. So, yeah, you don't have to take everything on your own. Just collaborate. That's an excellent call for the younger generations to embrace multidisciplinarity and not just do it by themselves, but do it in a team. That sounds like a very modern approach to science. Also, I like that you are inviting them to go into a topic that is, you are warning them that is challenging, but you are promising them that is reward. And that's fantastic. And then the last question that your audience and I, all of us, would like to know what's next for you. I mean, you have a whole lifetime of fire science. We know that. What we mean is in wind and fire modeling, what's next for you? Yeah, wind and fire coupled modeling part three. Hopefully in fire technology. three hopefully in fire technology so we're in the middle of this ancient opus grand that was mentioned where we want to see a complete image of wind and fire interaction over a single building to what extent the wind would be a driving force in the building can we define in which scenarios the wind was a driving force and in which it was not, then determine the probabilities of these scenarios to go into quite a complete risk-based analysis on was it a major factor in overall safety of the building or not. And if it was, to what extent? That will answer a lot of questions on how wind influences fires in general, because this will be a nice case study to refer to. And I hope, like, we are completing the preparation stage, so there is just this few thousand CFDs to be done and we're good. So that's the nearest future for that. And I have brilliant postdoc, Paulina Jamińska-Kadomska, who's working on this with me. She's a wind engineer trained by Tomek, my friend from Lublin. So she's very good at it. And she was a little overwhelmed with fire aspect, but it's under control now. She's very happy doing that. And she's discovering fire like we were discovering wind, and that's an exciting thing for her, I think, as well. So that's the project. We also built a wind tunnel in ITB for modeling natural ventilators. It's more like a business thing, you know, to investigate the performance of natural ventilators according to standards. But we're doing funny things with it. We're doing photovoltaic panel, natural ventilator interaction. We want to do scaled facades, especially scaled facade tests, you know, and quantify to what extent an outdoor test is changing the outcomes. I have that question with you. That's an interesting question, isn't it? So wind tunnel allows such a topic to be answered. And I really like the interaction of things on the building roofs, because I honestly hate the current way how natural ventilators are put on the market based on their individual CV value when we know different the performance of the ventilators is on the roof like every ventilator has its own performance you cannot just standardize that it's very difficult so one day I would like to abolish that probably as abolishing the the standard test curve it's not possible it's overwhelmingly on the market. But yeah, these are the next nearest steps in wind and fire. And we're taking it one step at a time, going deeper and deeper, understanding it better and better, and hope to provide broad answers to this narrow question, does wind influence fire? Are you going to have open tours to your tunnel facility? Everyone's welcome. If you're ever in Poland, the wind tunnel is in Pionki. I'm already in the list. I wonder about the audience. Everyone's invited. If you end up in Poland, just give me a call. We can arrange it. It's a good photo opportunity. The table rotates now, so you can take a music video type of shoot inside. It's a great thing. We can measure your aerodynamics if you want. That's awesome. Mine is horrible. That's fun. You should organize a conference, Boje, in ITV, and you can invite some of your most successful podcast episodes to be part of the conference. That may be a possibility. We'll see in the future. I think it would be, in general, it would be great to finally meet again with people, like real people, not on the screen. And I cannot wait for this chance to finally reemerge. It emerged already, so I'm happy. What is the name of your postdoc you mentioned again? Paulina Jamińska-Gadomska. Perfect. So I think I'm going to propose that there is a quote for this episode. I think the quote should be, you might want to actually repeat it if you agree, and then we make it your quote. The quote is, find your Tomac and find your Paulina. Yeah. And then if people want to know what that means, they actually have to go through the podcast. Yeah, that's brilliant. Many people are meeting a wall trying to solve issues where others have solutions for. And you don't need to know everything. Sometimes it's more than sufficient to know who knows it and then just work together. And I believe in this collaborative mind of scientists. And it's also a philosophy that you implement over your students, this openness, collaborative environment in which the best things can emerge from. I think it's very rarely that a single person creates a groundbreaking solution. Not in the 21st century. Maybe Newton could do that. Now it's very hard. And the last question is, there is another type of fire, smoke, and wind, which is related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin's war, that is actually, as we speak, ongoing, not far from you. I mean, this is probably not something that you want to model, but is there other ways that you are thinking of how you can help these horrific events that are happening very close to you? In terms of fire research, you know, and especially fire wind research, there was awfully lot done in terms of understanding how efficiently we can burn cities of our enemies. Probably more research on how can we efficiently destroy than on how can we efficiently protect. Unfortunately, the wartime research, the post-wartime research, one of the major threats related to nuclear weapon use is the radiation cost and the ignition cost by this weapon and how fires will spread. There was immense amount of work done on how fire spreads in cities, how fire destroys cities, but also how to, in a way, make sure that your cities hit less than the other city. So fire engineers have surprisingly long history of researching that field. I just think it's not my generation and not yours generation. It was the generation of the dinosaurs before us who were much into that. And there are NATO guidebooks about that. There's the Pitts review that I mentioned. There's a lot of literature that can be used. And yeah, fire is a weapon. Of course, it is a weapon. The second issue that I think that is related to war, but not directly to military actions, is the safety of the people who escaped the war. And there's 13 million Ukrainians relocated by the war. Imagine, that's the country that has 40 few million people, and 13 million of them are not in their home because of the war. One third of the country. They don't, to the best of my knowledge, they don't have huge camps yet. But probably it's inevitable if this continues. And then we go into the struggle of providing fire safety to them. And they have... They than fire on their head, you know? They don't really have a chance to care about that. And I know you're director at Kindling, and I admire that company a lot because you guys are doing what these people cannot, or it's not on their mind at the moment. And I think providing fire safety to those who escape war is tremendous value. And it is very important to understand the challenges they go through, and if there are solutions that can be given advice to them that will solve some of the problems that they may not even consider a problem, but they are problems. So I think it's a difficult subject, but I'm very, very happy that there are people like people on Kinlink who actively work on that and already are looking into solutions. So, yeah. I know Daniela is who spoke in your podcast, she's already talking to you in how they can help. It's just that as fire engineers, we try to fight fire as an accident. It is very, very sad to have to work sometimes into fire protection or protection of people when it's not an accident, when it's the military abuse of someone else. That is very hard. That's very unfair. And that's when the call is higher, right, to help those that are being hurt left and right for very banal reasons. But thankfully, you know, the work that has been done, the whole fire protection engineering industry, all the work on the fire resistance, all the work on the reaction to fire of materials. Our cities are built different than 100 years ago. They are more fire resilient. They are more fire safe. So thankfully, in a passive way, by stopping these accidental fires, we're also making the job of the incinerators more difficult. And that's probably one good thing, again, from our fields to the people in Ukraine at the moment. There's always a war in the world, so many others are affected by wars everywhere. And fire is a part of them, always. Well, thank you, Bogi. It was an absolute joy to interview you. It was my first interview that I interviewed someone. And I did it just following your book. I listen to you weekly, so I learned how you do it. I thought, I'll try something similar to that. Thank you, Guillermo. You did a great job, and it was a huge pleasure to be interviewed. I have a fresh page, no notes on my... It's so refreshing, interviewed. I have a fresh page, no notes on my... It's so refreshing, you know, every time I do it. That's mine. Yes, thank you. Thank you for doing that, and I'm happy to land this tube to spread important messages in the future as well. Cheers, man. Thank you so much, Wojciech. And that's it. It's me again in the driver's seat. Thank you so much, Wojciech. And that's it. It's me again in the driver's seat. Thank you so much, Guillermo, for taking it over for one episode. And thank you so much, actually, for proposing doing this and organizing it. That was a nice surprise. And it was way more fun than I thought it will be. And actually, it's surprising how much the perspective changes from host to guest. It was, I guess, a much-needed experience for myself, so I can torture my guests better, actually. And anyway, I hope all of you enjoyed the wind and fire things I had to say. It's a fantastic topic of science. It's a subject that's never-ending because as many buildings, as many fire and wind interactions there will be. And I think if we want to build a fire safe society, we need to understand this phenomenon better. My team and I, we are working very hard to understand it and build guidance for the rest of the community. And we are very happy to see other groups interested in the subject, other researchers pursuing their research in the field of wind and fire. It makes me very happy to see how this field is growing and so much great stuff will come out of that. And I will not torture you anymore. With wind and fire science. I think if you sustain so long. You are good enough. And thank you for doing that. Thank you for enduring that. Thank you for being here. And yeah. 50 episodes of the podcast. It makes me very happy. And I hope you enjoy this show. As much as I do. And if you do. Well next Wednesday., and I hope you enjoy this show as much as I do. And if you do, well, next Wednesday, next time I see you, episode 51, and it's going to be awesome as usual. See you there. Thank you. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
