 Hello and welcome to episode 10 of the Fireside Show. Episode 10, wow, that sounds like some sort of a mini-milestone. I'm very glad to be here for the 10th time and I'm very happy that you are here with me. If you're listening to this podcast for the first time, I hope you stick around. And if you're actually listening for the 10th time, I really appreciate that you are here with me. listening for the 10th time, I really appreciate that you are here with me. I'm really thankful to every one of you that send me nice messages on email or LinkedIn and comment on the show, share it with friends. This is really something that pushes me forward and I'm very appreciative to all these efforts that you take your time to reach out to me. For today's episode, I have a little bit more relaxed topic, however, still very, very important for the fire safety engineering as a whole discipline. Today, I've invited Dr. John Gales from York University, who is some sort of Indiana Jones of fire. is some sort of Indiana Jones of fire. His passion is history and he's doing a really great job uncovering the historical backgrounds of fire safety origins. And today we're going to discuss in depth one of the aspects of fire safety engineering, that is the standard temperature time curve or relation, if I may. The standard temperature time relation is a description of the evolution of temperature in time that we are using to test elements for fire resistance in our furnaces. And it's something that has been standardized for over 100 years. I was actually quite shocked when I've learned that the curve is already 100 years old. And when I've learned that, I've came to realization that it did not really change that much since 1917 when it was invented. And still today, it's the basis of the assessment of fire resistance and, in a way, a proxy of fire safety in the structural fire engineering world. So the background, how the curve was invented, how it came to life, is something that shapes modern buildings. So it's definitely something that we need to understand and know because any limitations of that time have consequences in our time. More to that, many of the discussions we're having today, the important discussions like mass timber and fire, are things that have already been discussed 100 years ago when the curve was created. And many of the thoughts back then are still relevant to today's discussions. to today's discussions. And yeah, in 1970s, we had this very good two-piece paper by Bobrovskis and Williamson who have covered most of the origins of the standardized fire testing and how the curve was created. And for me, that was a cornerstone piece of knowledge that explained how this came to life and what are the limits of the curve that come from the times of its origin. But then I started talking to John, and John did something very brave. He did not stop at the research done by Bobrowskas, but he was looking for more knowledge, for more sources, for more papers from the time when the curve was created. And he spent a significant part of his academic career, he mentioned it, it took him 10 years to write the paper that we're discussing today, to actually uncover the other narratives to the story. And as he mentioned, he was seeking for the reasons why some decisions were taken. And it's absolutely fascinating to discuss story. And as he mentioned, he was seeking for the reasons why some decisions were taken. And it's absolutely fascinating to discuss that. Since we're going to talk about the story of the origins, it's very related to the people who created the standard curve and who are the most important characters of their time in fire safety. And yeah, you're going to hear a lot about Ira Wilson, who was an American scientist who was very much responsible for standardizing the fire resistance testing. You're going to hear about Sylvanus Reed, who was his colleague, and he was a furnace designer. And John attributes a lot of the aspects of the modern fire testing to Reed's work. John attributes a lot of the aspects of the modern fire testing to Reid's work. You're going to also hear about Edwin Sachs, who was an European engineer, architect, who has done some research on fire and structural fire engineering in Europe and here, and who organized a very important event, a conference in London, in which a lot of knowledge about standardizing this curve was shared. There are more characters to the story, but to learn more about them, you probably have to study John's papers, and yeah, it's absolutely worth it. In the episode, we will also touch some other aspects of fire resistance in a historical view, because we're going to talk about some antique fire protection systems. And from that, we'll jump into the fire safety of heritage buildings, which I think is a practical touch to the historical discussion that we're having. So, yeah, I really hope you enjoyed this episode. I have absolutely enjoyed talking to John. He's a fantastic guy and his knowledge about the history and origins of fire and curves and fire safety engineering as a whole is astounding. And I truly could speak to him for hours on this subject because it's something that fascinates me as well. So yeah, I hope you like this episode and without further ado, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is here with Dr. John Gales from York University. Hey, John. Hello. Thanks for having me. Yeah, thanks for coming. Thanks for taking the invite. John, besides being an extremely talented fire safety engineer and scientist, is a kind of archivist of the fire science community, because for some reason his passion is to dig into the history of fire science. In the Green Room, he mentioned that the paper on historical origins of fire testing that we're going to discuss today took him like 10 years to finish, which is amazing, man, to keep amassing material for a paper for such long. And what a great paper that is. So before we jump into the origins of the fire testing and then, let's say, fire resistance, what are the origins of your interest in this historical aspect of that? Well, I'll kind of try to keep it brief if I can about it. When I was back in high school, my majors were actually in history, and it wasn't until I struggled with the idea that I felt I couldn't actually make a career out of it at the time. So I kind of abandoned it, picked up engineering, and I always kind of had an interest about the history of technology and the background. And then when I started my PhD, you know, being in Edinburgh, there was all these old books and things to look at. And I just started digging. And then you start finding all these types of works that, you know, nobody's seen in 100 years or read in 100 years. And it just starts becoming really fascinating. And then there was all these parallels to what was going on today and then you know started writing and then each of the drafts that i was putting together i was never happy with okay and part of why i was never happy with it is i never could really think of what was the message and why should this paper exist and it wasn't really until about two or three years ago and related to the the workshop where i started to think actually it needs to be talked about because the issues we're having with new technologies not really new but like timber they were having back then with concretes and steel so then all of a sudden there is a message that needs to be talked about because how they dealt with this paradigm shift is pretty important about how we're dealing with this paradigm shift. But it took a long time before I was even comfortable. To be quite honest, I could probably spend another 10 years diving into more materials, and our paper kind of leaves it for that. We will be very happy to receive more fascinating papers on that, actually. And when you were doing your PhD, was that kind of the time where the BRE archive was transferred to Edinburgh? Yeah, and that was really interesting too because one of the people who did a previous history paper said that there was this paper that had the origins of the Standard Fire and that it was based on melting and fusing points of metals. And the paper reference was by a guy named Biberdorf, and it was written in the 1960s. So what happened was is they said that they couldn't find the paper, and they said that the paper might not even actually exist. So we went up into the BRE archive, which was just right above the Ivey lab in Edinburgh, and the paper actually was there. And I remember going through it. And first off, the author wasn't an engineer. He was a medical doctor at a hospital. And he didn't even say anything about metal fusing or melting points. And so that was definitely not the origin paper. But it was interesting, at least to see that one reference that somebody didn't really look at very carefully became one of these source documents of these myths according to the origins of the curve but the archive like there wasn't much before 1920 in there most of the stuff in there was the 1940s 50s and 60s 60s. So if somebody did a follow-up to this and tried to cover that era, there would be some useful things there. But for this project, that was mostly the extent of what was found from it. So we have a little footnote about that in the paper. You said it's important to track the past because it affects the present time and and actually how we'll tackle the future and i seen this i see this in modeling as well i i personally was uh i'm fascinated in in the topic of the visibility in smoke and i had a podcast episode on visibility as well with gabriela and in visibility in smoke there is this series of five papers by by gene which are actually written in Japanese. It's like everyone cites these papers and Gene did an English version summary of the contents of all five of them. But actually, I've paid quite a significant amount of money to have these papers translated from Japanese to Polish and to be able to truly understand what's being there. And once you start reading them, it gives you such an in-depth view, you know, on things that you were taught or I thought that are like very flattened and just maybe oversimplified by gin. And no, they were not actually. The studies are beautiful. And when you start reading them in their original form, you learn so many new things, so many new views, because it seems the guy was a genius. He was brilliant, and he was limited by the technology and the capabilities of his times. That's for sure. So the fact that the resulting model is oversimplified does not reflect on the scientists. It reflects on the times. And I think it may be a similar story with the fire resistance yeah definitely when you look at it the the test and fire resistance was meant for concrete and steel and they tried it with timber in the 1917-18 column tests and they couldn't control the furnace and you see that in the plots that they have and then afterwards you start seeing a series of papers of people questioning whether it can actually be used for timber and they they actually say it shouldn't yeah there's the same thing that we've said in our paper that uh like not that it shouldn't. I mean, at this stage, I think the fire testing is a completely different thing than fire science. It's a useful tool to allow for market control in terms of what's being used in buildings and a convenient way to set requirements by authorities. So that's what the fire resistance or fire testing framework is for me today. It's not science. Maybe in some parts it is, but mostly it's not. It's replicating some temperature curve. Yeah, but it gets questionable to me because what I'm seeing is that people propose new timber flooring systems that are hybrids. flooring systems that are hybrids their approach may just be to do modeling to it but there's no assessment really of what it's going to do and even in a in a fire test you're limited by the size of the the furnace itself but some of these proposed flooring systems are hybrid because they want a long span of a timber floor which can't be assessed in a fire resistance test, or at least, you know, to what it would do in reality. So it's... Yeah, and you say they've fought the same battle like 100 years ago when they were like setting this up. And now 100 years ago, we come to the same conclusions. And yeah, anyway, the historical origins of fire testing. So I'm going to lay down a context and you will correct me. There was these two paper series by Bobroskas and Williamson in the 1970s that have pretty much summarized what was known in terms of where these methods came from and how were they developed. They actually give quite a passionate story how the different research units in the U.S. were developing their own approaches, how there was a New York group of people, Chicago group of people. There was Edwin Sachs in Europe. There were columns being tested in Germany. And then in some sort of magical way, they came to a conclusion, we need to standardize that. And it started in Europe and was, let's say transferred to to america astm group was formed and in in 1917 if i'm not wrong or maybe 16 they've actually concluded that this curve this this temperature time relation will be the one that's gonna be used from now now on. And I absolutely love the paper from Bob Rouskas because it's very thorough and interesting. And then comes John Gales and says there's a different side of the story. And then you pop up with all this amazing material from University of California curves and everything. What's the differences that you found? What are the most interesting differences? Well, I think it's more just the origins of the ideas and that when we talk about sacks we're talking about um families of fires and then looking at basically risk-based um approaches to buildings so basically saying we would have this type of fire or this type of fire and we should assess under a range. And that has generally been attributed to SACS for, you know, and they were looking into that originally to adopt into the standard fire. But when you really trace back things, it's not SACS who came up with that idea. It's Sylvanius Reid who, if you know, you hear Sylvanius Reed, you probably don't even know who he is. But he develops a series of different prescribed fires, and he goes even further to say that different occupancy or different types of buildings will have different types of fires, and that they need to be assessed accordingly. We are talking late 19th century, right? Yeah, 1896 is when Reid does his work. And how I found Reid was I did the classic academic search is who was Wilson's academic supervisor? And then I found who he was. And then I looked at his students and then he was a furnace designer, the supervisor. And then Reed and Wilson were both his students. And like students of a supervisor, you know, they always take, you know, they have to be different. So, you know, one person will favor this type of testing procedure. The other person will favor this. So Wilson does woodstock huts. Reed does furnaces with different temperature exposures. So it starts really kind of identifying where the technology begins and that origin as to how standard fire testing using furnaces starts to evolve. But you wouldn't have picked that up by just looking at Sachs or Wilson because that narrative isn't there. And it's not a fault of Brabaskis and Williamson for when they were doing the paper. The challenge was that that was done in the 1970s. And again, technology, there was no digitization. You would go to the library and that's where you would get your materials. And Brabraskis was very fortunate that 50, 60 years before, there was a course on fire design at University of California that had all these materials already there. that had all these materials already there. So our paper comes along and it's now looking at things that weren't accessible during that time. And then it starts filling in these missing links to that narrative. But it's not all the missing links. There's still more out there. It's just not digitized yet. I wonder what it uncovers. Maybe there was a paper in 16 that said, no, don't do this standardized test. It's going to end up horrible. Well, there is a missing link paper that we haven't found. And the missing link paper is the one of the meeting where Wilson and the rest of them are sitting down and saying, these are the points. And we just can only guess as to what that narrative is. And Wilson says it's arbitrary, but we just don't definitively have a document that says conclusively, this is why. We just have, we think it's this. And a lot of our history papers are all, you know, filling in blanks based on our opinions that are subjective. But there is no physical paper right now that's been digitized that says the points are this because. When I was watching, I think it was lectures of Jose Torero in Princeton, and he was drawing the standard curve and point he mentioned that it was a curve that encompassed every other curves that were at the time. And it was a compromise because it was like the one that covered them all. And then I look in your paper at figure eight, where you have your points based on your best recollection. And it seems it doesn't look like that. Like you're saying that the missing link is actually the sources of all the data points that led to this establishment of the standard curve? No, they just say it is that. Because right now we have all these different myths. We have myths of saying it's enveloping everything. We have myths of saying it's melting points. We don't have a paper that says the time and temperature at this point is because of this. We have papers that imply it, but we don't have somebody saying it directly is it is what we're missing and there should be a document out there because they did meet twice to define the curve and uh it's just that hasn't come to light and the meeting minutes that exist just say it's arbitrary yeah but even that, the key paper is missing. I guess you could figure out in a way where it comes from, the temperatures and the duration, maybe the criteria, right? So it's simplified. And the way it's simplified is that you have the New York tests, which are being controlled about five hours or so, 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. And then Wilson is involved in those. And if you actually look at who was actually involved, you'll see Wilson's names associated with those tests, although it's not commonly known that he was. In 1902, Wilson develops a new standard which responds to the criticism of that test, and he lowers the temperature from 2000 to 1700 and he also lowers the duration uh of the of the test so you start seeing themes of time and temperature and Wilson publishes a paper in 1912 which has a catalog of all the tests that him and Rudolph Miller were doing. And they start with the New York tests, and there's about 80 some odd tests. And then what Wilson starts talking about is an idea of making sure that the older tests, not just the New York tests, but, you know, UL tests and all that kind of stuff is then still captured by a new standard. And that's one of the comments he makes in his notes. But if you look at, if you just plot out the points, at one hour, 1700 degrees Fahrenheit is when the temperature is assumed to have risen inside whatever hut or furnace they're using. And then if you just look at the standard, it's a straight line up until four hours, which is 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, because that was the constant test. So it's not definitive that that is what they did. It's just this could be what they've done if you look at it. And it does seem to really simplify the narrative of saying you have two standards and it's a linear line between the two. And that's a very simplified way of saying it. But nevertheless, it's still, you know, no one knows why it's one hour. No one knows why it's four hours at this particular temperature. There's some bits, but it's not a definitive statement. It says that's what it is. Did they fuel the furnace with timber, with coal, with gas, oil? What did they use? No, they just threw timber in. Yeah. And then they moved the furnace design. And so Wilson Venture gives up on the hut and then and then they moved to furnace design and so wolson eventually gives up on the uh the hut approach and then they move into a furnace design and that's why reed was so important is that reed started with a furnace sax uses a furnace too but reed is you know uh pushing that narrative uh initially and uh and then eventually they they've settled on a curve in 1916, but they do call it arbitrary. So maybe it actually has no basis and it's just made up. In your study, you've analyzed ASTM minutes of the meetings, and you've also went through the journals of the time, the books of the time, even newspapers of that time. What were you looking at in the newspapers actually? Well, this gets to, it's more of the controversy and it didn't make it into the paper. Perfect. And we can talk about it actually because it's really interesting. We have about one or two sentences in the paper that say that there's controversy surrounding the tests, and especially the New York tests. And what happened was that there was a political inquiry around 1899 that was looking for corruption. Basically, the Republicans and the Democrats in New York were fighting each other. It hasn't changed. And what happened is they found that the Democratic Party was giving money to buy up shares of the concrete industry. And the concrete industry and the concrete industry was not trusted in terms of that the material wasn't trusted at the time because people were uncertain about how it would behave and so they would buy they're buying up stocks but because they also had control of the city in terms of the municipal approval of building systems there is a very big conflict of interest associated to it that resulted in a whole inquiry where people were being called in to basically testify about where money was going in the approval process of concrete flooring systems. And then eventually, I think two or three years later, concrete flooring systems were allowed with a fire test in New York at that point. So that narrative was glossed over because it's interesting, but it's not really painting the picture as to where the curve came from. It's just painting the picture. It's a lot more of a colorful story. That's the background that they had to work with. And obviously it was a new technology back then. Like we, maybe in a way that we face electric vehicles or, I don't know, photovoltaics nowadays and smart buildings. And we also have these types of very colorful backgrounds around some technologies with forces pushing to one side or to another side, not necessarily fueled by merit, but by business. And these things have not changed much since the late 19th century, for sure. One thing that makes me so interested in studying the origins of the fire testing is I ask myself the question, how big is the impact of the decisions taken in these rooms in 1916 over the next building I'm going to design? Because you can ridicule it. You can say that we are using the best practices of 19th century that led to the definition of the fire curve to design 21st century buildings. And in a way we do. So after studying this in great detail, how do you feel about the fact that these decisions in a way are today shaping the buildings we have today? Well, I think when you look at it, it was that their decisions were based on technology at the time, and that's how they made their decisions. And what's, I think, really disappointing is the technologies that we have at our disposal right now. Like you do work on developing some new ways of measuring, and I'm doing the same thing with some ways to measure stuff. But it seems as though we're basing everything on technologies from the late 1890s, like thermocouple readings, especially in North America where plate thermometers in some places are not even there yet. And the buildings are designed to that technology. If you want to go further back, the sprinkler system is arguably an 18th century technology that we have. I guess we've lost a lot of innovation, I think, in terms of looking at how technology could actually help us understand these buildings a little bit better. There's a quote in your paper that I really enjoy, and I'll read it. To suggest the standard temperature-time heating curve still serves its original purpose to this day is to argue that no advancements have been made in fire science, instrumentation, or even structural engineering since 1916, which is not correct. This is really powerful. And even if you take, like, architecture, like, let's drop the materials, drop everything. We're building buildings in a completely different way. Like, we're having open space buildings. We're having big atria. I mean, our structures are completely different than the ones that were at the time where this was originated. Maybe back then, the compartment fires were the most critical ones. Now, obviously, compartment fires are still possibly one of the biggest sources of fatalities in fires. But I would argue they pose a significant structural fire engineering problem. But I would argue they pose a significant structural fire engineering problem because, I mean, there's a reason why traveling fires were defined and why parametric fires were introduced at some point. The fire is not necessarily as it was understood in the 19th century. There's a reason that we changed our minds because there was so much brilliant research done in the 50s, 60s, 70s. And none of that has found a way to the standardized fire testing. There were things that were built around standardized fire testing. Parametric curves, RWS tunnel curves, now traveling fires. It's nice additions in the same, let's say, direction, but it does not really amend the fire testing. You mentioned you didn't look that much after 1920, but did you notice like these attempts to amend the fire testing in a way? Well, it's difficult to look at the ASTM after 1930 for two reasons. The first reason is that the copyright laws restrict the digitization of those files to be read. So if you do look at them, and so we're fortunate in Canada that Queen's University actually has all the ASTM meetings, what you see actually is the proceedings start becoming smaller and smaller and they're not they're not transcribing the discussion anymore and it's just really we're making this change to the standard but it doesn't really talk about what really happened at the meeting and when you go today too like if you go you're you're going to learn a lot as to what what's happening behind the scenes but for you to look at up what happened at that meeting and what was said at that meeting it's not recorded so you you you lose that context as to what what's happening with that story. So if you want to look at 1930 to 1980 and what was happening with that standard, it's hard to find materials that say how often somebody might have said, let's revisit it. You get a few snippets here and there, but you don't get a full story of what was happening. We know that there were tries. We know the story of Ingeborg who tried to calculate the area underneath temperature curve to get comparison between different fires. And we know how that didn't go as planned in a way and how it was a blind street they've entered. So maybe after that, people were less encouraged to change. I don't know. Well, they still tried. They still tried. There was all these other equivalency measures that people were bringing up. And things, you know, especially in the 1960s, when steel was getting a lot of research done, there was a lot of people looking into that. steel was getting a lot of research done. There was a lot of people looking into that. And you do start seeing some alternative solutions emerge for steel structures that weren't necessarily solely focused on making a fire resistance. So it was basically, do you have any actual fuel there? Can you justify exposed steel members? And some of that was actually happening so but that was outside of the standard that's really um interesting uh how how these things evolved to the place where where we are today and now now i start to worry we need to write better meeting notes if anyone wants to dig through our archive in in like 100 years well yeah well that that was a critique we actually got on our paper is about that the discussion wasn't happening at astm and i was like there was a whole conference we held two years ago to talk about the standard fire in a way but um uh notes in general, I think, you know, there is some privacy that has to be respected at a lot of these meetings, especially, you know, in having people feel that they can openly talk about things. And we see that today very much. And as well, you sometimes also have to, like, distinguish between the voice of a person based on their experience and the interest of the organization they represent. Because we know how normalization works and it's not just passionate people about fire. It's normal that industry has a significant voice in the discussions. and voice in the discussions, and this voice sometimes represents what's the best for the industry, not necessarily what's the safest or best for fire protection. Or what's considered a disruptor of the industry, and it can have a very large economic impact to change the way something is being done. I think one of the other big dangers about all this transcription stuff, and especially when we look at history, you know, 100 years from now, when somebody else is going around looking at how did we define the procedures to adopt these new buildings that we are, if you know, there isn't context there. There is a very big risk of somebody perverting the history and having it just say what they want it to say, which can be a big danger when you're studying history stuff, as you have to be very neutral. I think we're quite safe in this regard, because in 100 years, if someone wants to go through my team's meetings that are recorded, they will just not be able to find the codec to play the video, so case solved. Or they just use the Twitter feed that's archived. We need to carve Twitter feeds on stone to preserve it for entire generations to come. In your research, and that's the second paper that I really liked, was the experiments or research on the fire performance of heritage encapsulation materials. And in a way, it themes to the history of fire testing, because fire testing was developed to test materials and test solutions. And here in this other paper, you're talking about solutions that existed at that time. So what made you go through historical ways to protect mass timber of the time? Yeah, well, it started looking at the origins of fire testing in general. And in the 1700s, there was David Hartley and Charles Mohan, who were doing a whole series of fire testing. And it was like the renaissance of science at that time, where everyone was testing whatever they could, however they could. Mohan was looking at a plaster system. Hartley was looking at a steel plate system. So this origins of testing came about and then Holland does like a reproduction test. And the reason Holland does this is that he had a theater burned down or at least his colleagues had a theater burned down and they wanted to basically design the most state-of-the-art theater in the 1700s using all the technologies of the time and his tests were based on houses so he he burnt some houses down with the with these materials and he said okay they work so i'm going to put them in my theater well right away we start seeing problems that we have today where we take a test data point and we extend it to a condition that you know isn't isn't what was tested. And so they build the theater, and it uses the steel plating system on top of timber and this plaster. And, of course, the plaster will fall off during the fire. The steel plates are conducting heat through anyway. So we know qualitatively what these materials were doing. And so what happens is that theater actually catches on fire. This one that they'd fire designed. And because it was a theater, they used a sprinkler system the night before as part of the theatrical performance. So the water system was drained. So the sprinkler system didn't work. And the curtain rusted shut so the curtain didn't come down either so the whole theater's lost and uh so what what kind of happened is two two things came out of that is one a lot of architects were really mad at me for writing about that really yeah because henry holland is considered a very famous architect, and he did all this fire testing that didn't work. In fact, his theater burnt down. But no one mentions that in his biographies and things like that. So they that occurred is we were trying to get some photos for the paper. And we found that there was a mill that still had David Hartley's fireplates. And we got very excited. And the owner of the mill got very mad at us for being very excited, because we were like, oh, we're getting a photo for our paper this is great and then the owner said no this is horrible because of heritage restrictions i'm not allowed to remove these steel plates and because there's water logging behind the timber the steel plates are adding extra load and they're collapsing my building but i'm not allowed to remove them so that point we started to do some testing just to see, you know, how bad are these things or how, you know, how, how do they compare to modern things? So we used a cone collimator to do the controlled heat source onto the surface because we wanted something that we could actually compare, and we wanted to do heat flux, not temperatures. Yeah. And then it just resulted in a catalogue of these don't work, and they're probably even worse for your structure, even though there's heritage principles that conserve them. In front of my eyes, I have your description of the compositions of these materials. And it's like fascinating to read that. Mahon's plaster, one measure rough sands, two measures slag lime, three measures chopped hay well mixed with water. Yay. I've made a rhyme at the end. But that's a fantastic. I think one has ground clam shells or something like that in it. Yes, yes. There is the Holland plaster. In your author's composition, it's 75 milliliters seashell. So that's amazing. The students had to break the seashells in the lab to replicate the composition, which the worst was the hay. The hay really smelled. Okay. Like, I don't think we put hay into modern fuels. We use hay in fire testing, but let's say for the quite opposite reason than the fire protectant. Well, and it does what you think it does. It's just at the time in the 1700s, they were just exploring different types of things. But that breaks, right? The research from the 1700s and into the early 1800s doesn't really actually affect how the standard fire was coming to be because it stops and then you get this renaissance around 1860, 1870. So there was like a half-century gap between this technology being developed and used and then it possibly took some conflagrations to happen to realize there is a bigger issue, there is a bigger problem with fire overall. And the concrete was introduced as well, so it also changed a bit. But it's also they didn't have technology to measure anything. So they didn't have technology to measure anything. Oh, yeah. So they couldn't measure temperature. And, you know, they could do a fire. They could look at the materials after a fire, but they couldn't actually do anything scientifically until there was a way of measuring. John, we are talking about the time where the phlogiston theory was the leading one. and it was actually pre-discovery of oxygen and writing how oxygen works. So that's this kind of ancient fire science we are talking about. I mean, this research is closer to Great Fire of London than to our times. So it's really the ancient technology. In here you also mentioned copper plates and and i was like wow why would you use copper plates in because because they kind of work in a way it's just massively in your uh in your research i see they work how it is just the fact that they transfer all the heat away like a giant radiator or it it's a it's a short duration exposure we use okay so so in that sense it worked but what what it is is that and if there's any criticism of that our copper plates were shiny okay right whereas you know if you look at a heritage building and you look at a copper plate there it's covered with oxide yeah yeah so it's not going to have the same properties, and especially when you're using radiative heat onto the surface. But then one plate of copper on that 100 by 100 millimeter sample costs, I think, $150. Okay, yeah. So, and the students almost threw it out. Oh, no. After the test, I was like, don't throw it out. Oh, no, no. After the test, I was like, don't throw it away. No, no, no. We are testing a lot of cables in ITB, and I know these eyes of people when they see this, I don't know, half ton of copper cables going into the furnace and being burned down completely, and they just see it it melts away or um so uh and you compare this uh the solutions to like modern gypsum boards and stuff like that how they how did the the plasters rank or so you said the past has fell down but did you actually manage to have the plaster uh stay on the top of a surface and measure something with it? No, the plaster, so if you test in the cone and you test from top to bottom, the plaster will stay there because it's, if you test on the side, which you can do on the cone, the plaster will just tip right off because it's not really adhered in. Whereas your modern technology is screwed in. So your gypsum board, and we did a, we did a type X gypsum board just for comparison. And, you know, obviously it does a better job in that sense. Yeah. The, in that particular paper, the comparison showed that, yeah, we have engineered solutions that are not just, I'm going to throw all these things together and say it works. If I recall correctly, in ITB, we also had some interesting research on cast iron elements. And we were like purchasing columns from very old buildings and trying to crush them in fire and test the fire protection systems of these columns. I think the paper was in preparation. I think it has some trouble in the review because it's very difficult to define what kind of cast iron it is and what its properties are because we literally may not know that very well. We know more or less from which part of Poland it comes, but there's an original flavor to cast iron everywhere. So it's very difficult. And it's really hard to get over here in terms of doing experiments on cast iron. You were, yeah, they don't produce it anymore in that way. I was wondering, it's obviously interesting on its own to be able to test heritage materials. But let's say you're an engineer and you face a very practical issue. You have a heritage building that has some old protection ways. Is there any way to provide historical accuracy or preserve the historical value and protect the building? Maybe you found some materials that can replace the old ones and and be like historically accurate or not really you have to go modern yeah i think i i think there there's a balance to play and i think a lot of people are really struggling with that conservation as to you know what what can you change in the building to make sure that it's going to be somewhat fire safe uh with things and what new technologies might interfere with keeping that appearance. So there is definitely a struggle that definitely does not have enough people looking at it to coming up with optimum solutions. I think what you have to be careful about is if there is a technology that somebody says is supposed to help with the fire that is very old and somebody's using that as part of their assessment that says that the building is is protected from fire i think there's some value from recent research to say actually no that technology is not doing anything other than it's there for conservation purposes uh uh purposes and such. And in some cases, in the building I mentioned, they can actually be acting to destroy the building. So there is a very big balance to play there and to consider. And then in terms of some of these other technologies that we might put in, well, if you want to have a timber building and you want to use modern technologies like gypsum board, you're covering up the timber. So now all of a sudden you've lost that architectural feature that makes it the heritage building. So there is no real answer to say that, you know, this is what you should do. Each building is going to be very different, and each building may be missing something, and it comes down to risk. I mean, I would put it in this way that if you have a heritage building, like Cathedral, Notre Dame being the most notable recent example, if you lose it in a fire, you lost it in a fire, and that's it. You don't have it anymore. If your pursuit of historical accuracy led to what historically happened in such buildings, because there's a reason why there's not many of them left, they usually were destroyed in one way or another. So, like, preserving this aspect and losing the building, I mean, it didn't really serve well. We have modern technologies that can help in securing these types of buildings. I'm not sure if you deal with the historical buildings that much. Well, the problem where we are in Toronto, and it's actually helped our research, but in Toronto, heritage is being treated as just to look at the facade and maintain the facade of the building, not the interior of the building. So what happens is people are demolishing these buildings and then building up all these condos and high-rise buildings in their place. So we're losing them really quickly. How it's benefited our research is when one is being knocked down, we show up with a flatbed truck and we collect the columns and the bricks. That's cool. And it's the reality as to how it's being treated over here. It's certainly not treated very well. So it's a tough over here it's it's certainly not treated very well so it's a it's a tough thing to to look at but in a way it's kind of helped us in terms of being able to actually assess these materials because we've been able to get access to you know 150 year old timber beams that are coming fresh out out of a building a real building, to the same size, and being able to actually assess those, which is then useful for when you look at, if you want to understand hardwoods and how they perform in fire, especially if they're aged or in certain types of conditions, you can understand a little bit more about what the risk is associated to leaving them exposed in a very large setting. It would actually be very beneficial because it can help you understand how the modern buildings built with a structural timber would act, would behave in like 50 years, 100 years, and to assess how they perform in fire. Well, maybe that's a problem of future generation of fire engineers. Well, what we've seen is actually the modern timbers do, under comparable heat fluxes that we impose their incident, we see that the modern ones do much better. And it has a lot to do with the growth of the grain associated to it. So, yeah, it's a tricky subject to look at, but we're still looking at it. We just finished a paper that we've submitted on it that should be a pretty interesting one, looking at the radial cracks in heritage structures. I would love to read on that. That's really like a non-destructive imagery of the of the interior of the of the structure yeah yeah just just basically do you have more charring if you have radial cracking on your timber column uh penetrating into the core of the column which is that's really good what the journey it was in in this episode from uh developing the... Good talk for Alex. I know. From breaking into your archives through how the curve was created, the standard time temperature curve, then back a hundred years before to uncover plaster and now to talk about the future and preserving heritage. And it's all within the same narrative of historical origin. I hope that people from the audience will send some questions and feedback. If you're interested in this narrative, maybe we should force John to write a book on that or something. I don't know. We're already writing another book. Really? It is on heritage, but it's on evacuation model. evacuation model. And I know your research on anthropogenic changes in the models of people and how the evacuation has evolved in time. So that's another. This is what makes FIRE fun. There's so much that you can study and there's always an idea. It's not hard to come up with an idea. You just wonder what happens to that type of building. You have a project. That's so good. So, John, thank you very much for joining me here. And I wish you all the best in your research, in your emerging fire group. Well, it's actually quite a successful group, not longer an emerging one. We've kind of swelled in size over the last... Oh, yes. Yeah, I really hope we can get the momentum going so that we can expand the number of faculty. It's pretty tough, right? I'm always looking forward to the new fire research coming out from York. Thanks so much for joining me here. Thank you. Yeah, see you joining me here. Thank you. See you around, man. Thank you very much. And that's it. It was really great chatting with John about the origins of standardized fire testing and these narratives that he's uncovered. It's absolutely fascinating to learn how these things came to life and how the choices of the engineers back then still have effect on modern buildings. I actually found it quite interesting and fun in a way, how John described the scandal that was connected with the origins of fire testing, with these concrete flaws, with these fights between Democrats and Republicans and who owned the concrete business back then, and possibly some illegal activities there. John, actually, after the talk, has sent me a really interesting paper about this scandal and inquiry, and it's really interesting to read it and learn that the origins of your field may not actually be as clean as you thought it. It's really interesting. So I hope you enjoyed the episode. And in the podcast, I'm going to try to come back to the historical aspects of our discipline a lot and interview people who have knowledge about how things came to existence and where the magic numbers came from and how the modern testing methods how the modern materials were created because um it's something that that usually is very worth to understand and know maybe not directly useful in your everyday fire safety engineering practice. But it gives you another view, another light on how the techniques, solutions are used today. What was their origin? What were they intended for? For the historical episode, that's all. In the next week, I'm going to prepare you a true fire science episode. I'm going to take the mic again on my own and introduce you to the world of measuring temperatures. John has mentioned a bit about that in today's episode and how the people of the time when the fire curve was designed were limited by their ability to measure. And today we were still limited in ways and maybe not with the ability to measure, but with the ability to understand our measurements. And that's something that I would love to touch on. So I hope you look forward to the next episode. See you next Wednesday.nesday and yeah thank you very much for listening to the fire science show see you around this was the fire science show thank you for listening and see you soon
