 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 101. Today I'm interviewing Chris Jeleniewicz, CJ, from the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. I cannot tell you how long we've planned this interview, but as with the recent announcement that CJ became the new interim CEO of the SFP, I thought finally that's a good time to get him on the air and talk about what's the role of societies, professional societies in the world of fire protection engineering. So in this discussion, you're going to hear the new interim CEO's opinion onP in terms of standard development, handbook processing, SFP foundation, and how they link the world of fire science with fire engineering. So jam-packed with interesting information you will not find anywhere else. If you're curious about how society works from the inside and where our society, where we are going, then this podcast episode is made for you. So here we are, time for an intro, but as I'm still in a celebratory mood and we've just passed 75,000 individual podcast episode downloads, wow, thank you so much, that's a lot of downloads, I guess it's time for Matt Bonner's song once again. Let's go. Hey friend, what are you doing this Wednesday? Isn't it the perfect day to learn some fire safety? Cause I know a show that'll blow your mind. Come give it a listen, who knows what you'll find. Cause there's a whole damn world of fire out there. And the show's gonna cover it all. So come and spend an hour with my friend Boychick I know you're gonna have a ball How fast can you leave if you have a disability? Or maybe you have problems with some smoke and visibility Or maybe temple buildings are of some concern If you have an object, I'll tell you how it burns, because we're going to talk to every fire expert, or at least the ones we know. So plug in your headphones this Wednesday, and listen to the This podcast is brought to you free of charge and in full open access thanks to my partnership with my diamond sponsor, OFR Consultants.

And now back to the episode with CJ and the future of SFPE. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm today here with Chris Jelaniwicz, CJ from SFPE. Hello, CJ. Hey, Wojciech. Hey, it's great to be here. And the first thing I wanted to say is I wanted to congratulate you for producing a great podcast. You know, wherever I go, I'm hearing a buzz about it. You know, you had my past professor, James Quintero, on the other day, who was my first fire dynamics teacher. Actually, I attended his first course at the University of Maryland. It was definitely like a roller coaster. It was kind of fun, but there was a lot of ups and downs. definitely like a roller coaster. It was kind of fun, but there was a lot of ups and downs. But, you know, I think you're doing a great service to the profession of fire safety engineering by getting the word out about all the important things that we're doing in our profession. And I thank you for that. Thank you so much, Gilles. It means a lot to hear that from you. And yeah, I'm very happy to do my part as good as I can. We've been talking about an interview for a long, long while. I'm meeting you like almost monthly in the PPD groups, which are fun, of course. But now you have recently became an interim CEO of SFP. And I always wanted to talk to you about where societies are in the whole landscape of fire safety engineering. Like, what's the purpose of society? And now I'm super happy because I'm actually talking to a person in a driver's seat. So, first of all, congratulations on this important role. And now, whatever you say, we will hold you liable because you're the boss now, man. No escape now. Yeah, that's a great discussion to have. And yes, I've only been in this position for the last two weeks, but I've been at SAP for 19 years. I started as our qualifications manager, working on things like the PE exam and fire protection, and I moved on to the chief engineer position where I had the opportunity to work with developing our codes and, I mean, our guides and our standards and, you know, probably our important content, the SFP Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering, which is a true honor to be the editor-in-chief of the sixth edition. That's amazing. And I will be honest with you, when I think SFP, your face is the first thing that comes to my mind. Now, I don't know if that sounds scary or happy, but I hope it made you happy. CJ, so 19 years with SFP, but you've been a fire safety engineer for much longer. So I wonder, how did you end up in SFPE? And actually, how the landscape did look back then when you started? It's kind of a funny story. One day, I was sitting at home watching television with my wife, and she was sitting there on her laptop. And she said, hey, there's a job opening at SFPE. I think you'll be perfect for that job. I said, what are you talking about? And she said, look at this job. It does all these exciting things. You know, there's an opportunity to promote the profession of fire protection engineering, which, you know, she hears me talk about all the time. And I called up SFPE. And before you know it, a week later, I was the qualifications manager working on our PR efforts to promote the profession and our PE exam and fire protection engineering that we do in the United States mostly. And I was really intrigued, you know, early on how I had the opportunity to meet all these great people. When I joined SFP as a member, I think it was 2005 or so, my first international conference was the SFP Europe in Copenhagen, the first one, the very first SFP Europe conference. I went there not knowing literally a single person outside of Poland. It was very interesting to finally meet and kind of become a part of this international society, like this being truly a part of something. It felt nice. And it still does, this eight, nine years later, now me being involved with the rise of SFP Europe and coordinating stuff down here. It's very rewarding, fascinating, and still meeting new people, still meeting new people that are excited for fire safety engineering and follow a similar path. They want to be a part of something. And I think the sum of all our somethings is the SFP. It's a nice thing. Yeah. You know, it's interesting you bring up the SFP Europe organization because, you know, probably started this effortPU Europe organization. Matt, with this great report, the status of fire safety engineering in Europe, we really looked at, you know, where are the schools in Europe? You know, where are people practicing fire protection and fire safety engineering? And where's their certifications and things like that? And, you know, that report gave us the building blocks to really develop a strategy to where we are today. And that first conference you mentioned, you know, I think that was our kickoff, our really official kickoff. You know, that conference at Copenhagen was, hey, SFP here is in Europe. We're having this grand conference and we're here to stay. this grand conference, and we're here to stay. And, you know, if you go back a couple weeks ago to the SFP conference in Berlin, where we had such a huge number of people, you know, attend, and people from all over Europe, all over the globe, you know, coming together, discussing fire protection engineering topics, it was just a great thing for everybody. I think, in general, SFP Europe conferences have filled a very needed void after the passing of Jean-Claude Desmet. And he had these Eurofire conferences that were very popular in Europe. And as he passed away, I think SFP Europe conferences are in some sort the continuation of that effort. So a very needed thing for Europe. And also you mentioned ECCG. You know what? I always liked the name ECCG. It's just a show. It has such a nice, you know, sound. It's like singing. ECCG. It sounds serious. It sounds professional. Who are you? Where are you from? I'm from ECCG. I mean, that sounds serious, right? I'm from ECCG. I mean, that sounds serious, right? But SF Europe is also great. And I don't know if you're aware of that, but we all call SFB, SFB Global in here. And I hope you're okay with that. You know, we always get different numbers away. People look and say, is it SFPE? Is it SFB Global? Sometimes, you know, where our headquarters is at in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where, you know, we have this tremendous staff of great people that work every day to help make this organization run. We call ourselves, you know, headquarters or S&P headquarters. HQ, okay. Yes. Okay, so to not spend too much time on history, there's actually a great paper by David Lucht that's on your website that I will link in the show notes that gives a very good summary of the history of fire protection engineering, actually, from its earliest days in 1800s till the incorporation of SFP and the first decade of SFP as an incorporated being. One thing that's interesting, actually, I'll touch the history a bit, because it started as a subcommittee in NFPA, right? Yeah, and we were growing so much bigger and there were so much opportunities to promote fire safety engineering that we decided to split off into our own organization. And then before you knew it, Kathleen Allmoon, a great friend of mine who hired me at SFP 19 years ago, and besides my wife, I'll always thank her for being the one to give me this great opportunity, right? They moved from Boston, where NFPA is, to the Washington, D.C. area in Bethesda, Maryland, where I started working there. And, you know, it's funny you mentioned the history of fire protection engineering because, you know, we're coming out with the sixth edition of the SFP Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering. And we're going to have a new chapter. The very first chapter is going to be an introduction to fire protection engineering that really discusses how fire protection engineering has evolved from the Roman times when the city of Rome burned to, you know, where we are today. It's going to be authored by, you know, I don't think we could have found two better people than Jim Queeter and Peter Johnson out there in Australia to author this chapter. So that's one of the exciting things that I'm looking forward to. We'll see you in the SFPN book, sixth edition. Fantastic. We're going to come back to the SFPN book for sure in this interview. But I 6th Edition. Fantastic. We're going to come back to the SFP Handbook for sure in this interview. But I have more fundamental. Sure. In my first notes to this interview, my questions revolved mostly around the Handbook and PBD guideline. But given the circumstances, I have more fundamental questions to you, Mr. Interim CEO. So what's SFPE to you like? And where do you view it? Is it the handbook company? Is it the competency company? Is it a membership with benefits? I hope I don't offend you, but I really wonder, what do you think SFPE is? And where is its lays in the map of fire engineering? You know, the way I always looked at it, SFP really is our profession, right? Yeah. And when you look into all the literature out there that defines what is a profession, right, some of the things you'll see is building an organization of people who are practicing in this profession. And we're certainly doing that through our members and our chapters. And it says you have to have some kind of education component. You know, how do we get the practitioners to have the body of knowledge that's needed to do the activities? And, you know, we assist our colleges and universities. We develop the model curriculum for fire protection engineering. The other thing it talks about is you need some kind of way of establishing technical competence, right? And SFP does that in the states with supporting our PE exam, and we're working on, you know, moving that forward to other countries with our, you know, minimal competency document. And then at the same time, an organization like SFP or a profession needs to have some kind of body of knowledge. And I think the SFP handbook being our body of knowledge, but our engineering guides, our engineering standards, and then also the education programs that we provide for professional development that take the engineer past colleges and universities. And our conferences truly define that SFP really is the profession of fire safety engineering. SFPE really is the profession of fire safety engineering. And when I say SFPE, I'm really talking about the people who are our members, our volunteers, and like I said before, our chapters. That's very close to my heart because also, like, it's in the name. It's the society of the engineers, right? So it's the engineers who make it. And, I mean, I really love how you positioned it. I have nothing to add, really. It's really well positioned. I'm happy that this kind of definition comes up from the CEO. And is this also something you would call a vision for the SFP to go to and rooted in this fundamentals? What's your vision for the growth of the society and the foundations of this growth, actually? There's a lot of opportunities for us. So, for example, the growth of the society and the foundations of this growth, actually. There's a lot of opportunities for us. So, for example, the growth we've talked about in SFP Europe, you know, how do we expand that to other parts of the globe so people are not saying, you know, SFP is a U.S. organization, why do I care, right? We're currently working with the people of Canada right now. We're going to have a symposium on mass timber this year. So kind of a way to jumpstart how S.F.P.E. is also part of Canada. And, you know, we have a Asia Oceania chapter coordinating group in Asia. And, you know, there's some great people out there in that organization. And I think we have the roadmap like we have at SFP Europe to go to places like Asia, the Middle East. And, you know, 10 years ago, I wouldn't even be talking about fire safety engineering in Africa, basically. talking about fire safety engineering in Africa, basically. But, you know, now Stellenbach University down there in South Africa, they're doing all these great things. They've got these great students. We did a great article about them in a recent issue of our magazine, Fire Protection Engineering. And it's like, wow, look at all these great things in Africa, a continent we never really thought of. So it's really exciting times for SFPE. And is the case study of SFPE Europe some sort of model of how would you like to proceed in other parts of the globe? I think taking what we learned with SFPE Europe and adopting it to other areas in the way that it best fits. adopting it to other areas in the way that it best fits. So, for example, going into SFB Europe, there were a lot of government regulations and contracts and things we had to sign with the European Union and things like that. Well, that might not be the best approach in Asia. It might not be the best approach in Canada or wherever we go. It might not be the best approach in Canada or wherever we go. So to kind of learn what we did in Europe and kind of tailor it to me, what really works because we really want to have an organization that's going to be successful. And the only way we could do that is to make sure we're making the organization fit for that particular area. If not, we're going to be failures. In Europe, I start to see the real benefits of that. Like, okay, meeting the other chapters, you know, talking to people, having SFP Europe conferences, this is all very nice. It's nice to be associated. It's nice to be a part of something greater, you know, and that already is an added value. But now, with some efforts in Europe related to the European Commission performance-based engineering report that was published, now we are going to put all the chapters into some sort of work to produce a much bigger document than none of us would be able to produce. Like you said, Mike Sorgren produced something like that, but it was a tremendous effort and a lot of dedication for a single person to do. Now we're going to tap into the powers of chapters. And we've already seen that happening kind of informally if someone had a trouble. Oh, guys, help me. How this thing is done in your countries. And within a day, they had an Excel sheet filled with knowledge from from every single end of Europe how the thing is handled in that country because that's the power of a network. But now we're trying to get this structured, get this working on the document that's necessary for European Commission. And this exercise, I think, is the first time we really benefit from having an organization that all of us are in, because it's not going to be my report. It's not going to be yours report. It's going to be the report of organization, and the organization will produce it. And that opens possibilities that were never open, to be honest. So I'm excited for that. And if that's an outcome of this model, that's a fantastic one. Of course, Europe is different than Asia. We have European Commission and stuff. But still, maybe there are things that could work in Asia that would not work in Europe and could be brilliant for those people out there, right? Yeah, it's all exciting news. And, you know, you mentioned how, you know, we build our building blocks with our chapters. But I think another important thing that, you know, I'm seeing throughout the world, but, you know, especially in Europe, is the growth of our student chapters. You know, we now have a student chapter at the International Masters of Fire Safety Engineering Program, which the London area has a student chapter. And having these opportunities to set the seed with these students and letting them know what the cool things are doing. So if you're a member of the Edinburgh student chapter, right, you're finding out early in your career what SFP is all about. So it almost makes the perfect transition of getting into your career and then go joining, you know, the local chapter in your area and becoming a member of SFPE and then building your career forward. When I was finishing my university, I've learned about the SFPE handbook. And I would say that was pretty damn late into my education. I was like, God, why no one has shown me this magical book before? I've wasted so many years seeking answers that are just answered in the book. That was an amazing finding. Actually, that's a good time to switch up to the SFP Handbook. I've always placed SFP Handbook as one of the biggest inventions, achievements of the profession, something. I don't know how it looked in the 80s or 90s, but I can only imagine how the profession must have changed when such a powerful tool became available. So I wonder, now you're the editor of the sixth edition. First of all, where the Handbook is at? Like, where can we expect it to come? Well, in the beginning of March, the first week of March, we actually sent the draft document to our publishing partner, Springer. We sent them 102 chapters that included 5,000 pages of a Word document. 5,000 pages of a Word document. We had over 20 editors involved, over 200 authors easily. And we sent it away, and we're hoping to have it published, hopefully by the end of this year, the start of 2024. And I can definitely say that we got some exciting new things going on with the 6th edition. Okay, fantastic. That'll be all about it. Nah, just kidding. No, no, no. I'm going to... Yeah, okay. Because there's a couple of things I want to talk about this, right? This is our best thing. Like before we started the sixth edition, we put together a committee to review like what the fifth edition, how could we make sure that the 6th edition is meeting the future needs of fire protection engineers. We had people peer review the chapters in the 5th edition to offer suggestions. We wanted to move forward to ensure we had a diversity of authors from all over the world. And it's amazing, you know, the list of authors and the different countries they come from. And we wanted to provide more practical applications for the fire protection engineer. So I think you'll see that in the sixth edition. And, you know, you'll see a lot of new exciting chapters, a lot of them related to sustainability issues like refrigerant, lithium ion batteries, updated materials on facade construction, areas where we never had content that are maybe important today, like providing an engineering analysis of a building under construction or a building under demolition instead of looking at checklists and prescriptive standards. So what's your view? Like what the handbook should be for an engineer? Is it a complete knowledge base? Is it the reference point? Is it the starting point for whatever you do? Well, without a doubt, if you're a fire safety engineer, it's the one book you need to have in your collection. Of course, it's available on digital. But I think that there's a few things we want to accomplish with the SFP handbook. First, we're hoping it's being used in all the colleges and universities that have courses in fire safety engineering. So that that could be, you know, one giant textbook for most of your courses that you're taking. At the same time, we want it to be with every practicing engineer so that when they're doing a project, the available information is there for the practicing engineer to go out and do their jobs effectively. Now, of course, we're not going to hit every little, tiny, crazy niche area that comes up, but the principles of fire protection engineering, it will give you the equations you need, the frameworks you need, the equations you need, the frameworks you need, how do you use models, and what are the best models to use for the specific application. And then finally, when we're looking at competency, where in the United States we have the PE exam, it's the best study manual for people taking the PE exam in fire protection engineering or people who want to learn about the core competencies that we developed at SFPE, the subjects of the core competencies are all in this handbook. So it's one location for the fire safety engineer. I think the statistics are giving it justice for it being the number one piece in the engineer's library, I see at the moment 2,770,000 downloads of chapters and the book itself in completion at the spring. Almost 3 million accesses. This is insane in numbers of how accessed and how widely used it is. I wonder if it's sixth edition and it's coming up every seven years, I guess, more or less. How do you work on updating it? How do you decide what to cut, what to add? Is it this committee you've set that's deciding? Give me an insight on how the process looks so people understand how the handbook is evolving. Yeah, it's a very interesting process. Well, first that committee I talked about gave some recommendations on the structure. So, for example, the fifth edition wasn't divided into sections. The new sixth edition will have 11 independent sections. So looking at things like fire dynamics, fire chemistry, systems, human behavior, structural fire engineering, it would be divided into sections. So I think that was a major step moving forward. And then the editors, we appoint editors for each of these sections and they work with me as the editor-in-chief to develop the outlines for each of the individual sections. And we kind of looked at, you know, what kind of information in the existing fifth edition, you know, do we still need? Is there any information we don't need anymore? And, you know, what are the new topics we need to look at and we'll move forward. And, for example, who's deciding on the authors? Yeah, a lot of that is, you know, between the editor-in-chief and then a specific section editors. So not only do they put together the outline, they invite the authors. And a lot of times, you know, we want to give the existing authors the opportunity to come back if they were successful with writing their chapters. So it is such an exciting thing and it's a very long process just to develop that outline, contact the authors, getting them to agree, you know, to either update their existing chapters or write new chapters on topics. Very interesting. It definitely must be a slow and kind of painful process to go through that, but a necessary one. I wonder, do you think for the seventh edition you're going to keep it, or the world is moving too fast for the handbook to efficiently keep up? Yeah, you know, that's the best question of the day, because we are talking with our publishing partner, Springer, and this hasn't been decided yet, but once we publish the sixth edition, we're going to have a lot of discussions with our members and our audience, so the people who use the handbook, to maybe making this a living document. So instead of going through this seven-year process to come up with a new edition, that we could just have an editorial staff and say a new emerging trend comes up next year that we don't have content on, we could say, hey, let's write a chapter on that, and we'll just throw it in there because the handbook is printed on demand, so any future editions go into the printed on demand, and then, of course, the electronic version could be updated, you know, that day. Even things like the annex where we have all the material properties, hundreds of material properties. You know, that's one thing we did a great job with the sixth edition that we got some scientists from NIST, including Anthony Hammonds, to go back and look at all the material properties in the annex material to look at, you know, what is missing, what is old that might need to be updated. And so say we find a new material or a mistake in one of those charts, we can easily update that. Or we have a great chapter on human behavior data that, you know, has all kind of data on different aspects of doing a human behavior design. And if somebody has a new great research that maybe has data that we need to refresh in, we can easily update those tables in this data section so that it could be up to date instead of having to wait a full six, seven, or how many years it will take, you know, to get us into the next edition. So I think that's one really exciting thing about moving forward into the future of working with the future generation of fire protection engineers, for sure. Immediately in my head, I have, you know, lithium ion batteries. Seven days ago, it's ancient history. Like seriously, the cells that were tested in 2017-18 are not very used anymore. So I think it definitely needs a revamp. But what you propose here is a very interesting model that could potentially really work out well. That's a very interesting model that could potentially really work out well. That's a good idea. Also, on the topic of handbooks, because SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering is not the only thing with a handbook in the name that SFPE is branding. There have been multiple, let's say, topical handbooks published over the years. There was one on structural engineering by Kevin LaMalva, Danny Hopkins. There is the Environmental Effects of Fires by Brian Mitchum and Margaret McNamee. And there are more of those. What's your strategy on those? Are these the deeper dive books for a specific field? What's the SFPE's way of processing with those types of books? And what niche do they fill, in your opinion? Yeah, this is something we started new in SFP about a year ago, which is called the SFP series with Springer, where individual authors or a combination of authors can come together and write a book that's important to our profession. You know, some of the handbooks you just mentioned or some of the new things that are going into the series. So that gives us an interesting opportunity to find these areas that maybe SFP as a whole doesn't have the resources to go through our procedures to develop standards or official SFP guidelines. But to get topics on these areas out to the fire safety engineering community, we're also looking towards maybe developing textbooks in areas of engineering so that colleges and universities, areas of engineering so that colleges and universities, because, of course, you know, there's definitely a dearth of textbooks out there for fire protection engineering students that, you know, maybe work in them with the SFP handbook at the college and university level. You mentioned textbooks and also SFP has these core competencies. SFP has core curricula. The handbook and the other books fill within these gaps. So it starts to emerge like a quite coherent ecosystem of knowledge that an aspiring fire engineer should have. So you see those resources being direct application into courses or maybe they need some more development into textbooks. But I think that's an intriguing thing to have a complete educational offer, like from zero to hero in a specific field of fire safety engineering that gives you the exact competencies you need, because the CIP knows what competencies that are, with the exact tools and skills you need along that because, you know, the curriculum and everything that's necessary to achieve that. I think that could position society quite well in the educational side of fire protection engineering, right? Yeah, exactly. You make a good point there. You know, we have these minimum competencies. We want to know, make sure that we're providing, one, the body of knowledge. And then, two, are we providing the education that's needing to does that body of knowledge relate to the core competencies and ensuring that that curriculum is inserted there, inserted into the curriculum? Things like the PE exam, you know, do we have the body of knowledge for that? And other competency things we want to look at to the future. So there's a tremendous amount of organizational activities that go behind the scenes with our education committee, our qualifications committee, and our technical committees to, you know, really work together every day to ensure that we're moving in the same direction. Because if not, it will never work. So another topic on my list, and you've already brought it up a few times, and I even brought it up in the intro, the guideline documents that SFP is producing. And I'm now involved in the performance-based design guide new edition production, and it's a very interesting process, probably a little more demanding than I've expected at the beginning, but definitely interesting. And you can learn a lot, actually, from being in a committee. That's one thing for sure. And I recommend participating in those committees for everyone. If you wonder, is it a lot of work? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Yeah. But tell me, what's your view on where the codes and guidelines should go for SFP? Yeah, that's a great question because the performance-based design standard that we're developing now is a huge project, like you mentioned. We started off with the first edition of the SFP guide to performance-based design. And, you know, we got people from all over the world that were doing performance-based design to come up with a framework, right? And this was, you know, one of the important documents, I would say, in the history of Fire State, the Edge of Hearing. And we moved that forward to the second edition as a guide. It wasn't a standard. to go to a model code like the International Building Code or NFPA or, you know, a SIN standard or an ISO document even, these codes will not allow you to be in the body of the standard itself. So to get referenced into a body of, like, say, the International Building Code or NFPA standard, you also need to be a standard. So that was one of our first reasoning behind, you know, moving our guide to a performance-based design standard. And second, we really feel that moving forward as a global organization, there is such a big need to have this as a standard as opposed to an engineering guide. But at the same time, you know, we're going to provide that information you need for a really good standard, but we're not going to forget about the how-to information we provided in our guidance documents. So we're going to have a lot of that kind of how-to information placed in the annex of the document. So the standard itself is going to give you to what are you required to do for a performance-based design. But when it says, let's develop a fire scenario, we're going to have good information in our annex to provide the engineer with that kind of guidance. But at the same time, we want to make this our fundamental standard. So when we look at individual topics, some of our other guidelines or standards can match up to it. So when you're looking at human behavior analysis, how can, if we say you need to do an ASET or SET kind of evaluation of something, well, you could go to our SFPE human behavior guide. It will tell you how to do that. More information is available in the handbook of fire protection engineering. When you're doing a risk analysis, oh, you should be using the SFP guide to find a risk assessment that provides the framework for doing this risk assessment, right? So we kind of think of the SFP performance-based design standard as the main book where all these other kinds of standards work together. these other kinds of standards work together. You know, maybe if you're looking at a tall building and you're looking at doing a performance-based evaluation of the evacuation, the standard could point you to our tall building guide and other places you could go. So once again, it's another opportunity to make a mark on how performance-based design is being used and performed throughout the world. I always refer to the PBD guide as the mothership document that the smaller ships will be leaving from and jumping into land and something that will connect the whole SFP codes and guidelines ecosystem. So will other documents follow the same formula? They will become SFP standards from now on? How exactly does one advance a guideline to a standard, by the way? Well, we have a committee called Subcommittee for Standard Oversight, and they control what we do as far as developing guides and standards. You know, they're responsible for writing the procedures on how you develop a guide, how you develop a standard. They decide what topics we want to look at for our standards and guides and whether it should be a guide or whether it's appropriate to be a standard. And then after a committee has completed the document, they give the final approval to not do a technical review per se, but to ensure that that standard was developed in accordance with the SFPE procedures. And if it is a standard, we also ensure it meets the ANSI guidelines, which SFPE is an ANSI standards developer, to ensure that meets the procedures so we have the best document available. So it's more the definition of the process rather than the definition of the document itself, right? The quality control, the way how it's developed. Okay. Okay, very, very interesting. You mentioned how it takes so long to develop a standard. We have these procedures in place so we could really take a fine look and make sure, you know, we're not putting things out there that aren't really useful or that could really cause problems in the future, right? Yeah, I guess there is the headquarters of standards that tells you if it was not produced for 10 years, it cannot be a standard yet. No, just kidding. I hope it's not like that. processes and procedures in place that ensure that what's inside is actually can be used as a standard because there's a certain language, certain structure you need to use. It's not easy to write a standard as someone who's been involved in European standardization for much longer than I am with SFP. I know that it's not an easy work to actually produce one. I know that it's not an easy work to actually produce one. One thing that comes to my mind, thinking about the whole ecosystem of the documents that SFP is providing to its engineers, today's modern fire safety engineering is much more than engineers, you know. And we all know that. We all are sometimes the victims of that, that we come into projects too far, too late. We all know that as many fire safety engineering graduates there are, they will always find a job because there's never enough fire safety engineers on the market. And yet, we also are aware that the important decisions are being taken without our presence, because maybe it's too early in the project to involve us, because maybe we were never meant to be involved. There's architects, structural engineers, mechanical engineers doing these designs, decisions. And we cannot continue like that, CJ, in this world. We need a way to influence those decisions so we end up with safe buildings. We cannot always rush into projects to save them. We need competent engineers outside fire safety engineering. We need competent engineers outside fire safety engineering. We need competent architects. Do you think SFPE is something that can participate in this difficult mission or it's beyond the scope of the community? No, it's definitely not beyond the scope of SFPE where, you know, qualifications for practitioner is one of our biggest initiatives, whether it's, you know, some of the things we already talked about or educational programs, but our model curriculum really focuses on what is a competent fire safety engineer, and we're hoping that colleges, universities look at this. But at the same time, what we're looking for in the future, as far as our minimum competencies are concerned, we have this minimum competency document. That defines a general fire safety engineer. But we all know that, you know, a lot of fire safety engineers do different roles. Like one person might be working a lot in the area of structural fire protection engineering, or one person might be doing a lot of work related to human behavior and fire. Or another person may be doing investigations and forensics work. So what we're looking at now is developing succinct roles that you can work with our core competencies to define the knowledge that is needed to do the work in those specific roles. So I think we're going to be publishing some of those roles by the end of this year. And once again, this is another way that SAP could provide leadership in the area of qualifications. And I think that our next step, an important step, is, you know, how do we get this to the street, right? How do we get jurisdictions to understand that this is important? How do we get our colleges and universities thinking about this? at our colleges and universities thinking about this, because that's where we should really start is providing these educational programs to ensure our graduates have the knowledge that is needed so that the practitioner could perform the activities that are needed for a specific role. But do you envision something like, you know, Fire Safety 101 to civil engineers? I mean, it's unrealistic to expect that an architect will dig through 5,000 pages of SFP handbook. So we maybe need something that conveys the same message at a much less sophisticated technical level, but gives enough information to take the basic decisions and at least know where to seek knowledge. You envision something like that? I would highly advocate for SFP developing things like this. One thing we do try to focus on is the fact that we know everybody that's practicing fire safety engineering did not come from a school in fire safety engineering because there was no way we could meet the demand for the design community. So one thing we do see is a lot of people met at the School for Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Structural Engineering, getting involved in the profession, but really focusing on, one, getting the experience, working with organizations that do fire safety engineering, and how we supplement that at SFPE, not only with our body of knowledge and our technical documents, but as our educational courses that we provide. So in the last Berlin conference, we had Steve Gwynn teaching the basics of human behavior and fire. Probably not the best class for somebody who has a degree in fire protection engineering, but it's a great class for people who never had academic work in the area of human behavior and fire. Michael Stromgren taught the performance-based design course. Same thing. If you never completed a performance-based design course, it's not going to tell you how to do everything that's needed in one short class, but it does tell somebody who's unaware of the subject of how to understand the fundamentals of performance-based design. And my friend Vladimir Moser from the Czech Republic taught our risk assessment class out in Berlin. And once again, if you're doing risk assessment every day, it's probably not the best course for you, but for people who have never been exposed to risk assessment. And I think moving our educational programs forward, I think that's a big thing for SFB to focus on is, you know, one, are we providing education in the areas that we have that niche in the marketplace? So certainly human behavior, risk assessment, performance-based design, tall building design, structural fire engineering. These are all topics where our members are the best people, right? We have the best people that look at this kind of stuff every day. So these courses that are developed by the best instructors where nobody else is doing this work. Another great example is computer models. You know, without a doubt, we have the best course in FDS out there. If somebody wants to learn how to use FDS more than just the black box, put data in, then you get an output. You know, that's a great class to show somebody who's never worked with that. So I think these education programs really provide that void that is needed. I can only second that because I actually gave the course on FDS with Gabriele in Rotterdam. That was fun. Another relation that I need to ask you about, because you're in the FHIR science show, so I'm very interested about the relation between SFPE and science. And it exists, of course. There is FIRE Technology, which is a SFPE journal, and we all know and love it. The connection was perhaps a little stronger some years ago, where SFPE was the secretariat of IFSS. How do you see this relationship with science and scientists today and in the near future under your CEO-smanship, if that's even a word? Well, for a few years now, we have been working with the IFSS. And the big thing we're looking at and the folks over at IFSS also think is important is, you know, how do we take this great research that everybody's doing and provide that to practical applications? At the last IFSS conference, we had a workshop on the exact topic. Coming up in this year's IFSS conference in Japan, we're going to have another workshop that focuses on performance-based design. other workshop that focuses on performance-based design and, you know, what is the research that we currently have and the data we currently have for practitioners, but where do we need to go in the future? And Peter Johnson and I will be co-chairing that workshop. And I think it's a great opportunity to get researchers talking to practitioners to move forward because we really need to make that connection. And then another way that I think is important is the SFP Foundation. Okay. You know, our SFP Foundation is a great organization. They're moving a lot of cool things forward. For example, we have what is called the Grand Challenges Initiative that is focusing on developing a strategy for research in the future needs of our profession in areas like energy and infrastructure, in areas like energy and infrastructure, resilience and sustainability, digitalization, AI. We also, the foundation has a WUI working group, which is trying to make the connection of how fire protection engineers can work with the fire departments to solve the WUI problem. So, for example, we currently published a free WUI handbook that describes how, you know, engineers could provide, because there's a lot of things, a lot of knowledge out there that engineers understand that we could look at in solving the WUI problem, you know, things like modeling and flammability and things like that. And this WUI handbook, I think, is a great step moving forward. And, of course, who doesn't like free content? And then we also support larger grants. Like currently we have a larger grant looking at digitalization and how the fire safety engineering community, you know, needs to move forward when it looks at things like BIM. And at the same time, our foundation is providing a lot of great smaller student grants to give the opportunities to some of these smaller universities throughout the world. They're trying to provide fire protection engineering courses. So we're giving out grants to students with the opportunity, places that you would never imagine fire safety is being discussed at the college and university level. So it's really an exciting time with the work we're doing at our foundation. There's a lot of great things there. I suggest you go to www.sfp.org backslash foundation, where you can find, you know, a lot of reports we're developing that are looking at these kind of issues. And, of course, you know, none of this would be able to be done without our donors. So, of course, it provides a way that if people think this is a great idea, you can also donate and advance the research needs of our profession. I can vouch for that. opportunities of our profession. I can vouch for that. I actually had three recipients of SFP Foundation in my laboratory. Diego Alvarez Coedo from Spain, there was Ifa Zulmachi from Malaysia, and Francesca Goresi from Imperial. And they've all done great research. And it seems my laboratory is a perfect target for this type of grant. So if you want to apply and you don't know what to do with all the money, you're very welcome in my lab uh anyway this is a very very welcome addition um for the for the scientific community and with your other outlets like fire protection engineering journal or sfp europe magazine are you looking for new ways to bring science closer to the engineers because i had some honest conversations on this podcast. David Stacey comes to my mind where we've talked about, is fire safety engineer really reading the fire technology? And it doesn't seem so. So the science must be digested in a way and given to engineers. And I think the outlets of SFP are perhaps one of the best ways to do that. Well, we've always been excited about our magazine, Fire Protection Engineering, and also our SFP, your publication. Fire Protection Engineering magazine, actually, on January 2024, will be celebrating 25 years of this publication. celebrating 25 years of this publication with the focus of providing practitioners practical skills on needing about emerging trends in our profession. And it gives us an opportunity, as opposed to waiting to get it in the handbook or a guide or a standard, we could get that information, kind of information out quickly to our members. But at the same time, you'll start to see, you know, more articles from our foundation on some of the cool projects they're doing to make that link of, you know, how do we apply this research to our profession? So, for example, on the topic of sustainability, that's changing every day. Like you know, what is the needs of the fire protection engineering community as far as sustainability is concerned. We're getting articles in FPE magazine about sustainability issues. We also are going to have three or four webinars this year that specifically focus on sustainability because it's moving so fast. You know, things like facades, lithium ion batteries, a host of other things, new information coming out every day. So we're going to use these vehicles to get the word out to our members. So what are the next SFP events that we meet each other? What do you have in your sleeve? We've got some more exciting conferences coming in the future. October, we're going to be in the Washington, D.C. area. We're going to have our annual conference, and we are going to have some exciting things going on there. Professor Jim Mielke, the chair done so much of developing the future fire protection engineers or the current fire protection engineers. And on Monday, the first presentation at the conference will be a keynote presentation by Dr. Mielke discussing how fire protection engineering has changed. And finally, one new thing that we're looking at as far as conferences, symposia are concerned, we are starting to develop symposiums that focus on specific issues in fire safety engineering. Last year, we had a great symposium in Chicago where we focused on storage occupancies. And what these symposiums we tried to do is get the best speakers to not only focus on the topic that we're looking at, but we provide some kind of field experience. So at the Chicago symposium, all the attendees had the opportunity to go to UL and witness a full-scale fire test, which is very exciting to everybody. This year, we have plans to do a symposium in Canada in August at Waterloo University, where we're going to look at mass timber and hopefully give us an opportunity to do some kind of other field event. And then finally, we got a sustainability. We're coming back to Europe for a sustainability symposium out at Slovenia, where we're working with the folks at Frisbee, who I think you know very well. And it's just going to be another way that we could get this kind of stuff out to the European community firsthand. CJ, you've mentioned Jim Mielke's farewell speech and stuff. It has just been announced that Jim Mielke has passed the chair of UMD Fire Protection Engineering to Arnaud Trouvet. So my sincere congratulations to both gentlemen, one for a lifetime of dedication to fire protection engineering in the Temple of Fire Protection Engineering, and to Arnaud for stepping into this very important role. This looks exciting. Well, of course, as a Terp, I graduated with a BS degree in 1987, and I had the best opportunity in the world to be a student of John, Brian, John L. Brian, Professor Brian, the prof who developed an accredited fire protection engineering program in the United States and sustained it for so long. And then at the same time, had an opportunity to be a student of Jim Mielke, who, as you said, is retiring as chair, who was an amazing teacher. Without a doubt, I had great experiences for Jim. I had the opportunity to work with him as a student at the university where we worked on a project related to protecting a highway from fire. And moving on to Jim, who has almost every SFP award to work with him, teaching the principles of fire protection engineering course that SFPE works, and working when Jim was the president of SFPE. He's done so much and been a great supporter of SFPE. So it was an honor and privilege to work. Like I said, go to school with Professor Bryan, Professor Miltke, Professor Jim Quateri, teaching his first fire dynamics class. I mean, I was really living the life back then. At the same time, I was able to be a volunteer firefighter right outside the university and go see fires every day. Well, I can attest that our know on combustion is not a bad choice either. So it's good that the tradition and the spirit of UMD is continuing with this change, and I'm very happy for how this transition went. Anyway, CJ, back to our episode. We're well over an hour of recording, and there would be a lot of things to talk about SFPE because there's so much more. The foundation we just tipped, the iceberg, the SFPE award, the role of SFPE conferences, but let's leave it where it is. I think we've touched the most important things, and for me it's that SFPE is a society of engineers, and plenty of good ideas on where it is and where it can be was given in this podcast for which I am thankful to you. Yeah, thank you. You know, in Humble's be sitting here today and talking about all these great things we're doing and I get, you know, the opportunity every day to help events and the staff at SFP. You know, we're all very happy that we could advance all these things that are going on. And of course, you know, working with our great members throughout the world, it is truly a great experience. It's great to know that you're helping build a profession that focuses on reducing the risk of fire. Is there anything better than that? If there is, let me know. Fires in microgravity. But, yeah, that's a tiny part, not fit for us all. Maybe one day. Thank you, CJ. And all the best as the new interim CEO of SFP. It looks promising. And I told you, we're going to keep you accountable. Thanks, man. Hey, sounds great. Thanks again. Bye-bye. And that's it. Oh, man, I see we're over an hour with this episode, and I've already trimmed it a lot. But that was a very long and very interesting discussion with CJ. And as you can see, SFP is something very close and dear to my heart. And as you can see, SFB is something very close and dear to my heart. So having the opportunity to talk with a new interim CEO, I really wanted to get the most out of it and learn as much as possible. I hope you've also got some nice nuggets, for example, how Handbook is produced and how it may change in the future. in the future. As CJ begins his journey as the CEO of SFP, I wanted to highlight and thank Nicole Boston for her years as the CEO of the organization. Nicole was always a friend of the podcast and very supportive to me. So thanks, Nicole, for all these years. And it was always fun to have you in Poland and you are very welcome wherever your next steps will be. And for the society, I mean, it's great to learn this is a very major organization. There's processes, procedures, there's unbelievable stuff that is working at SFP. Fantastic group of people who are very dedicated to deliver us, the engineers, what we need from the organization. If not the staff, it wouldn't be so great. There would not be such a great connection points between us and the organization. So, staff, you are the heroes of SFPE, and thank you very much for doing that. So, that would be it for today. And if you want to learn some more fire science, I welcome you next week. In this episode, I've teased the next week's topic a little bit, asking CJ about how could we educate architects, for example, a little better. Next week, a whole episode on that and boy, that one is exciting. So, yeah, see you here next Wednesday. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
