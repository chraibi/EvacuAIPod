 Hello everybody, welcome to the Firescience Show, happy new year, welcome to year 2023. I hope it's a great year for you. For opening this year, I have an interesting episode. I was recently asked to create some more introductory level content in the podcast to help those transitioning to the fire safety engineering, but also to help a lot of fire engineers around level their knowledge base. And I did record such an episode. I say I would consider myself a fairly advanced fire user. However, I still thoroughly enjoy talking about basics. So I'm completely sure everyone can enjoy this type of content. I like miniseries. I may actually frame this into some sort of introduction to fire miniseries. And I hope in this form it will be easier to find it and benefit from it. My first guest is Dr. Rory Haddon of University of Edinburgh. Rory is a very well-known world-class fire star. He's an expert in combustion, expert in wildfire dynamics. He's an investigator. He's a very all-around Mr. Fire Engineer. So I was very happy that he took my invite, especially that he's a very good academic, and his students absolutely love him. So he's also very well-fit to talk about the basics. And, yeah, we wanted to talk about combustion and flames and stuff that's related to the chemistry of combustion. Rory's a chemist, actually. So that's the subject we've started with. We've ended up in very different places, but they're all connected to fire and fire engineering. So yeah, I think that's it. It doesn't need any more introduction. Let's just spin the intro and jump into the episode. It doesn't need any more introduction. Let's just spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm here today with Dr. Rory Haddon from University of Edinburgh. Hey, Rory. Hi, how are you doing? Good, thank you. And we're going to talk about some fundamental stuff in the fire science discipline. I've been asked in a recent survey to prepare more introductory material for ones who entered the discipline from various ends of the world of science and engineering. And as we all know, nobody becomes a fire engineer by their will, but they come here as an accident. Rory, what's your story, how you became a fire engineer? This is a long story. I guess I trace it back to when I was in high school and we had to decide what career we wanted to have. And I told my chemistry teacher that I was going to do the special effects on James Bond movies. And that was shot down as not really a viable career choice. So then I applied to be a chemical engineer and studied that at university because I came from Aberdeen and we had lots of oil in those days. So that seemed like a very sensible thing to do. And then as I was finishing that degree, I took a class in biodynamics with Google Drysdale, which was great for that. But by this point, I had kind of thought, well, there's no way that's going to be a viable career for a chemical engineer like me. And then a few weeks later, I got an email from Guillermo, who I think is known to this community, saying that there were PhD positions available, and if we were interested in doing a PhD in fire science, then we should go and talk to him. So I did, and then the rest is history, I guess, from that point. Yeah, nice. Another one in the club of switching professions and coming to fire science. So even better, put yourself in the mindset like what you would love to be told when you switch from chemical engineering into fire safety engineering, or let's just read out loud Dreisdell's book, because that's probably a viable introduction to the discipline as well. I mean, that certainly would be a starting point for most people, I think, yeah. In the end of this episode, in the show notes of the episode, I'm going to try to list some reading sources because there are some really great introductory resources. And not everyone is aware of that. And it certainly helps. So today I would love to cover the aspects of flames and combustion and like the fires. We define some things related to that. What are the definitions of things that we need every day? And I would start with maybe not an easy one, but the flame. Like what exactly is the flame? Like how do you define it as a fire engineer and how do you define it as a chemist? I mean, for me, this is a very interesting question, and it's one that I asked at the start of my second year class. Defining what a flame is, everyone, I think, is familiar with it, right? You see it. It's just kind of maybe it's yellow, maybe it's a little bit blue. But when you start looking at actually what's going on there and you start exploring the structure of the flame and why it looks like it looks. It becomes quite obvious, I think, what a flame is. It's really nothing more than a volume in space where you have some kind of chemical reaction occurring. And what you see as the flame is maybe separate from the chemical processes that are going on. So I think it's useful to separate those two things. So the chemical reaction is simply the reaction between the fuel that is generated somehow from either, it could be a gas directly, it could be a liquid that you have to vaporize, it could be a solid that you have to pyrolyze, and maybe we'll talk about some of those words later on. Basically, you have to get the fuel into a gas phase, and then it mixes with air from the ambient environment that's surrounding the fuel. When those fuel and air are in the correct proportions, the chemical reaction can occur if you have an ignition source nearby. And that ignition source could, of course, be a spark or another small flame. The chemical reaction then proceeds, and as it proceeds, it generates energy, and that energy heats up that volume of material, the air and the fuel, and as the fuel heats up, the chemical reaction goes faster, and we end up generating quite a lot of energy. And what we see as the flame is actually the manifestation of all the energy that's generated. The yellow stuff are little soot particles, the tiny little balls of carbon that are heated up to the point where they glow. And that's what we see as the yellow part of the flame. The blue part, if you've got a flame that's blue, what you're seeing there is actually the molecules themselves of the fuel being heated up to the point where they begin to not so much glow, but release blue light, I guess. So the process is simply the volume in space where chemical reactions are occurring, and what we see as a flame is kind of the manifestation of the energy that's released by that reaction. If you have a flame inside, it's holders. Inside there's fuel, outside of it is oxygen, and they react at fairly small space, right? It's an interesting point. I've been speaking about, I guess, what we commonly would call a diffusion flame. The fire science world separates things into two categories, I guess, of diffusion flames and pre-mixed flames. And that's a useful distinction to be able to make. And one, I guess, most people will be familiar with from chemistry classes in school where you have the Bunsen burner. And if you open that little hole at the bottom of the Bunsen burner, you get a blue flame. And that's a pre-mixed flame because the fuel and the air are mixed before they react. And if you close that hole at the bottom, you get a yellow flame, good from a match or whatever. And that's a diffusion flame. And it's called a diffusion flame because the process that controls the dynamics of that flame and the structure of that flame is the diffusion of air from the surroundings into that jet of fuel. And that diffusion process really governs the shape of the flame. It governs also the temperature of the flame. And it's really quite, I think, a fundamental part of fire science to understand what is that diffusion process and how does that result in the types of flames that we see. in most fire scenarios we don't have the convenience of a pre-mixed flame that's something that a combustion scientist might be lucky enough to be able to study but that's not something that as fire scientists we have the privilege of dealing with we have to work with certainly more i don't know it's more complex it's just different isn't it the different visits are diffusion flame i guess the flow patterns play a significant role in how these flames unravel and behave. You have fuel generated from something. You have oxygen that technically is everywhere around, but in reality, the fuel burns the oxygen around, so it needs to be replaced and replaced and replaced. Conveniently, it generates hot temperature gas, which has lower density than surrounding air, which creates a movement of its own. It's like, I don't know, did you ever define a fire as a pump? We thought about, like, it's a nice concept to show fire as a pump. It sucks the air, it burns the fuel and releases gases, and it's like a system. The kind of fire as a pump analogy works pretty well in, for example, a compartment fire analysis, where you have a clear well flows of air entering a space, and then the hot smoke and gases leaving the compartment. All of that is driven by the size of the fire and average temperature in that compartment. And I think that that's quite an interesting point as well when it comes to looking at flame because one of the questions that we often get asked is, what is the temperature of a fire? And that's a very tricky question to answer. One of the nice things about a diffusion flame is because the diffusion flame is controlled literally by the diffusion of oxygen into the fuel the range of temperatures that you get from a diffusion flame doesn't really depend on what's burning it really only depends on this diffusion concept and therefore the flame temperature i don't know more or less 1200 celsius maybe 1500 something like that it's not going to vary too much um but that is not when you start talking about the temperature of the fire, well, what do you mean by that? If you're burning something in a room, then maybe you mean the average temperature of the room, or do you mean the temperature of the flame? And that's one of the things that I think a lot of people who come into the field get a little bit confused by, or I don't know if that sounds a bit harsh perhaps, but it's one of these ideas that's a little bit tricky, I think, to wrap your head around. And we see it quite often being expressed in kind of a colloquial term, or that was a very hot fire, or that was a very cool fire. And I think that that goes back to this whole concept of what is a fire, what is a flame, and it's about the physical manifestation of the combustion process. So what you feel is a very subjective thing. And as scientists and as fire scientists, I think it's really important for us to talk in quantitative terms, not subjective terms. So the fire might feel really hot, but that doesn't mean that if you measure the temperature of that flame, it's any hotter than another fire. There's something else that's usually going on. I think that's a moment in the development of a fire safety engineer when they go through one of the earliest and biggest paradigm shifts in their perception of what they're touching. A flame is a flame, and it's separate from the fire. And the fact that you have a flame inside your building doesn't mean it's going to destroy the ceiling. inside your building, it doesn't mean it's going to destroy the ceiling. Like a candle flame is pretty hot, and if you put it against the ceiling, it's not going to do much of an impression on the ceiling. But if you have a thousand candles, there's a different story. Absolutely, and I think this idea of, I mean, the difference between temperature and heat, right, is kind of where you're getting at there. The idea of just because something's hot doesn't mean it's going to necessarily impart a lot of energy onto something else. And I think, again, that is probably one of the things that certainly I remember learning through the study of heat transfer and whatever, that that's a pretty important thing to wrap your head around. The idea of temperature and heat flux are completely separate concepts. I would like to go further into the chemistry of flames. So if you release gas into environment, it's not going to always burn because there must be a certain ratio of the fuel to the oxidizer in your environment. So let's talk about how we define them and how important they are for the fire engineering. So I guess when we're defining the, I guess, the hazard posed by a fuel, we usually would define that in terms of the flammability limits. So as you mentioned, you have to not any mixture of air and fuel will burn. You have to get them in the right proportions in order to basically sustain the chemistry. You know, if you've got too much fuel and not enough oxygen, well, your reaction doesn't go to work and vice versa. If you have too much oxygen, not enough fuel, you don't want to be able to generate enough energy. So this idea of flammability limits is pretty well established and for more or less any fuel nowadays, you can look these up. The thing that I think is usually quite surprising to people is that the flammability ranges for most hydrocarbon fuels, or the most common things that burn, are usually quite low. You know, you're usually in the region of a few percent, you know, 2-3% as the lower flammability limit. So you don't need very much fuel in your air for it to burn. But once you get above, I don't know, maybe 6% or 7%, then for a lot of fuels, it will be too, what we would say, too fuel-rich in order to burn. There's too much fuel to sustain the reaction. Of course, there are exceptions. The flammability limits of hydrogen are massive. Now, off the top of my head, I don't remember, 5% to 75%, something like this. Methane is from about 5% to 15% of methane in air will burn. Once you start getting into perhaps more common fuels, your liquid hydrocarbons and those sorts of things, you're down in this range of the lower flammability limit being around 2% or 3%, and then the upper flammability limit being around 7% or 8%. It's always in these sorts of ballparks. And that's a really useful thing to know for identifying the hazards posed by mixtures of fuel and air, and how you can look at whether or not it's possible to generate flammable mixtures. Because from that concept, the concept of the flammability limits of fuel, gas, and air, you can define the hazard posed by liquid fuels through the flashpoint, and the hazard posed by solid fuels through the critical heat flux or the surface temperature and ignition. So all of those ignition phenomena are linked back to this idea of flammability limits. I think acetylene may have the widest. I think it has some crazy wide, like 2% to 80 as well, like similar to hydrogens. But these are not your common fuels. Like you've said, many of them would have very narrow. So when there's not enough oxygen, does it mean that the oxidation reaction is not happening or it just happens but at a not quick enough rate to sustain it? Both, I guess. At some point, it stops happening. Okay. If you encourage chemical reactions to happen more by heating them up or by increasing the pressure. So basically, if you think of a chemical reaction occurring when two molecules kind of bash into each other or collide, then you can increase the probability of that happening if you increase the temperature of your mixture so the fuel molecules and air molecules are moving more rapidly or you can increase the pressure so you're just forcing them to be closer together. And both of those things will effectively increase the probability of collisions. So the flammability limits we've just spoken about are all at standard conditions, at air pressure, 20 degrees Celsius, whatever. If you increase the pressure or you increase the temperature, then the flammability ranges typically widen, and you'll be able to get these directions to propagate makes sense yeah and i guess also in the oxygen reach like i had an episode of all spacecraft where they would have an increased oxygen concentration you would have a different limit again the flammability you always have to check you know is it in air is it in oxygen is it by volume percent mass percent So there's a few details in there. But in principle, I mean, one of the things we are quite lucky about in fire science is most of our applications are atmospheric pressure and 21% oxygen in air. And yet we leave the complex stuff, high oxygen concentrations and high pressures to the clever people who do microgravity combustion. high oxygen concentrations and high pressures to the clever people who do microgravity combustion. Unless you're doing fire safety engineering in Denver or Mexico City, then it's more tricky. Okay, now next on my list, we've discussed the stoichiometry of the reaction, like how concentrations of fuel and oxygen allows the combustion to happen. Now I'm wondering about the ignitions. You've said that there's a spark or there's a pilot flame that can ignite the mixture. What are the ways how the mixture can be ignited? I think that that's an interesting concept. Of course, if you have even a flammable mixture of fuel and air within a volume, within a room, whatever, that will not necessarily immediately ignite, right? You have to put an ignition source there. The ignition source for mixtures, I mean, it can be, I mean, many things. You could have a small flame, and a decent rule of thumb is that any flame will be capable of igniting a flammable mixture. If you need a spark, sparks are a little more complicated. flammable mixture. If you need a spark, sparks are a little more complicated. Usually there's a concept known as the minimum ignition energy, which is basically the energy that your spark has to contain in order for it to ignite the mixture. You could just heat the mixture up. So quite a lot of combustion work is done simply by putting a flammable mixture in a vessel and increasing the temperature of that vessel until you get ignition. Other things that can cause ignition would be, you know, hot particles, hot surfaces. And these are often, you know, if you are looking at fire hazards in process plants or whatever, those are very often the kinds of hazards that you're most alert to. So ignition sources are very plentiful. And I think one of the nice things that fire engineering has done and process safety does is we kind of assume that there will always be one. So we kind of assume that if we have the conditions where there's a slambler, we will get ignition. And that's pretty fundamental to how we study a lot of these problems. So when it comes to other modes of ignition, I guess what we tend to do is try and divide them into two categories. We have the piloted ignition. So that's where we physically put something there to start the combustion reaction. Or we have so-called spontaneous or auto-ignition. So the piloted cases are quite nice because we can very easily define the ignition process, heat up a quid or solid fuel usually, and we get to a certain condition where the pilot flame that's there or this pilot spark that's there will ignite the flammable gases that are involved. When we look at auto-ignition, it's a little bit more complicated because we have to understand much more the processes that are going on in the solid phase and also in the gas phase. So we have to understand how the gas molecules are absorbing energy, how they're heating up, what is the temperature of that gas mixture. And that's kind of an ugly problem to try and solve. So fire science from more or less the beginning took that ugly problem and said, we're just not going to deal with it. How convenient. And we're going to focus in this piloted ignition world because then when we're dealing with liquids and with solids, we can more or less ignore everything that's happening in the gas phase. Only have to worry about what's happening in the condensed phase in the solid or in the liquid. And that's a very, very powerful thing to be able to do, right? But it does hide some of the complexities around the ignition process, which is the ignition is a gas phase, but when we talk about it in terms of defining the hazard, we talk about things that are related to the solid or to the liquid. The flash point is a property of the liquid, the critical heat flux is a property of the solid. And I think quite often we forget, I think, that that's what we're talking about. And that in the end, the ignition process is nothing more than heating your solid or your gas to the point where the mixture above the surface of that solid or that liquid is at the low flammability limit. And if you've got a spark or if you have a pilot flame, then that's all you're doing. The conceptual leap is always the same, which is vulnerability limits are what define flaming ignition. And the rest of it is some kind of way to try to express that hazard. It's super funny that you say that fire science has conveniently taken out and focusing on liquids and gases, where in the more today's fire science, like what are the sexist topics we have? Timber in civil engineering, of course, that's solid face, facades. Well, welcome to solid face, but in awkward configuration again. And there's no escape from solving this. The solutions exist, right? The solutions exist. I think the issue with a lot of this stuff is that we understand pretty well, I think, for individual materials. We've known, I mean, even before timber and the building boundary became a sexy topic, we knew how wood burned reasonably well. There's still many questions that we didn't fully have resolved. But, you know, before that kind of started, there's a very nice chapter in the introduction to fire dynamics. There's a nice section there on how wood burns, how it ignites. You know, everything was laid out before, because wood is not a new construction material. You have to, you know, bear that in mind. And engineered timber does not burn differently from regular wood. The laws of physics are the laws of physics. So what I think is interesting about it is that once you start trying to apply that knowledge in the engineering design i think that's maybe the difference that has happened in the last i don't know how many years it is now five six seven eight years i've been around doing this stuff it becomes quite difficult to apply that knowledge and if you don't really understand where it all comes from and why piloted ignition theory exists in the way that it does i can see that it becomes a relatively complex thing to try and understand. But the burning of all of these solid-phase materials, as you say, whether it's facades, whether it's timber, or whether it's just, you know, the stuff that surrounds us in day-to-day life. You know, apartment fires are governed by solid fuels, and that's how it goes. I mean, we need to understand that process of ignition of solids. And I think, unfortunately for fire engineers, we're able to remove some complexity from our lives. But the burning of solids is probably amongst the most complex problems that science and engineering can try and solve. Just because there are so many very strongly coupled phenomena, which is why I love doing it. I find it really interesting. Yeah. Tell me more. If you can just list how these phenomenas right? I find it really interesting. Yeah, tell me more. If you can just list how this phenomenon is coupled, I think it's fascinating to understand how much complexity there is in a burning log of timber. A burning log of timber is a pretty good example. I mean, if you think about just the processes that are going on, right, we've got to heat the thing up. So we've got heat transfer processes, conduction, convection, radiation, all playing a role in the burning of a piece of timber. We've then got the chemical reactions. We've got the pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis is the decomposition of the solid fuel into flammable gases. And in the case of a piece of timber, also leaves behind a solid char. So we've got a chemical reaction that is turning a solid material into gases. Maybe you can also get some tars there as well, so into some liquids. And then we still have this solid char left behind. So we've got all three phases of matter. We've got chemical reactions that are occurring on very complex molecules. The composition of wood is reasonably well known, but the decomposition of those molecules is not so easy to figure out. That will be temperature dependent and will also depend probably on the oxygen concentration, which brings us to the next part, which is we've got to get oxygen from the environment to the fuel. And so we've got a mass transfer problem. And we've also got the fluid mechanics because we have hot gases rising up and that's creating all sort of buoyantly driven air flows. So I mean we've got heat transfer, fluid mechanics, chemical reaction, mass transfer. We've got the whole suite of things that are complex to solve and they're complex to solve because what very often we don't know is actually what it is right. All these intermediate stages you know what is the exact composition at this position beneath the surface at this time and how does that change the chemical processing you know what actually is the concentration of oxygen near the surface of the log because that will change how the char oxidation occurs so it's spatially difficult to resolve temporally difficult to resolve and we never really have enough information. And also, I don't know how we could even get some of that information. I mean, I think that's one of the tricky things is, you know, they can't just take a probe to measure everything because then you will change the whole system again. So for me, the ignition and the burning of solid fuels is so complex and so fascinating that I think it does a disservice very often to overly simplify it. Although, you know, I think simplification is, of course, going to be required if anybody wants to apply this in kind of an engineering context rather than just a study as a scientific context. So the question then becomes, how do you simplify? And to do that, you have to know what are the most important steps. You know, is the most important step the heat transfer? Is the most important step fusion of oxygen? If you know what the most important steps are, you can design a tool or a method to help you apply, I should say, the problem such that it can be applied. But you have to go into all of the details, I think, before you can just make that simplification. Man, this was supposed to be an introductory episode and it's already crazy. I'm sorry to everyone who came here to figure out the definitions, but that's the beauty of fire science. That's the reason why it's such a complicated science and why we are not getting out of our jobs anywhere soon, because it's not easy. And in some levels you know why should it be right i think very often um people have a perception that i've seen fires you know i've built campfires i you know have a wood burner at home i have a coal fire at home and there's this kind of everyday familiarity with fires and one of the things i see you know it's my job um when i'm teaching you know undergraduate students or msc students is to try and break down that you know that comfort with the phenomena of fire and trying to introduce all of these complexities because i think i've said it before but the one of the best bits of engineering in my house is the fireplace you know it's extraordinarily simple but every single time i light a fire there, I get a more or less consistent result. You know, from how the chimney operates, how the air flows in through the bottom of the fireplace, to how the heat radiates the room. It's an extremely efficient piece of engineering and something that we engineered before we really understood all of these processes. So I think the complexity in things, I think we have to acknowledge that they're there as we go through these problems. I think another breakthrough in your personal pathway as a fire safety engineer comes when for the first time you experience a really large fire. Like when you take a piece of, I don't know, polyethylene and you put it into a bomb to measure the heat of combustion, in the end you get a slightly hot water and a number. You put that thing in a cone calorimeter, okay, it's going to burn quite nicely, but it's not a very impressive thing. So if you take a larger piece of that and somehow ignite it, it's interesting to observe how it ignites. And if you put that thing on a facade, it's a raging inferno. It's like nothing you've seen in your life, like someone opened a portal to hell. And for me, it was a huge lesson of, I don't even know the world. Like, it was really interesting to see how much the scale changes the fire. And once you hit a particular large scale with a very bad material, how bad and how quickly it can evolve. And once you first time in your life experience that, when you see a resource from cone color, okay, this one has like 20% more heat release rate than the previous one. That doesn't seem like such a huge deal, but it is in the end. It is. Same when you observe compartment fires. So I wondered, like, why in larger scale these bad fuels are even worse? Why these fires can so tremendously accelerate? these fires can so tremendously accelerate and why we have such a hard time slowing that down, like making these materials slow down. Yeah. So, I mean, fires are all about feedbacks. The thing that you often don't see in a small scale test is really the way in which those feedbacks occur. And that's usually because a test has been designed in some way to try and eliminate those, right? Because they're difficult to control and whatever. But once you start building up big assemblies and you let the fire experience or let the materials experience those feedbacks, you get really rapid or you can't give a rapid fire growth. And I think that that is the thing that takes most people by surprise. Certainly takes me by surprise now and then when you are doing a large-scale test and you know it's these it's these transitions uh that the fire goes within the most famous one of course either flash over in a compartment fire but even just if you've got you know a spreading wildfire or that spread on a facade as the flames you know they get larger you're burning more fuel you start to get things like the effects of char oxidation, if you've got charring materials playing a role, external variables, you know, the flow. All of these things generally act to enhance the fire spread. And we don't often see that in a small capacity in a laboratory because we don't have, you know, we're not releasing enough energy to create huge flows, and we don't have the external influence of wind, for example. So I think, for me, the way of measuring the size of a fire is always one that's a bit tricky, and I'm going to try and pull this back onto a learning point if we can. When we measure the size of a fire, we don't do it based on how tall is the flame or how wide is the thing that's burning. We always measure it in terms of the energy that's released. And we would call that the heat release rate or the energy release rate or what have you. But the rate at which basically the fire is producing energy, and that is measured in a unit of power, right? So it's measured watts, maybe kilowatts, even megawatts, if you get some proper fires going. Which is joules per second, like the amount of energy generated per second. Exactly, the amount of energy released per second. In a fire, you can go from something, I don't know, a candle flame is on the order of, I don't know, 10 watts, something like that. But you can have very easily a compartment fire that's on the order of megawatts in size. And if you look at some extreme wildfire behaviors, they will be measured. It's usually measured in terms of megawatts per meter, right? And that's the measure of the width of the fire line. So I just had Kevin McGrath on the show when we were discussing World Trade Center. Listeners know that. You don't know that. But listeners know that there was Kevin on the show. And from their assessment, the size of the fire in the World Trade Center was approximately 2,000 megawatts. So it was in the gigawatt range. So that's impressive. And when you start putting these numbers in context, I mean, you try to find something to relate it to. Two gigawatt fire. I don't know what is that. Is that a nuclear power station? Is that the output of it? I mean, I don't even know. You start getting a handle on this and what it feels like is quite tricky. And I would encourage people who haven't been able to do this to try and find a lab somewhere that will let you come in and see what a fire looks like. Because in our lab, we can run fires of up to around a megawatt depending on who's looking maybe a little bit more and you know i think the first time somebody sees a fire that's of that size it's eye-opening you know a one megawatt fire is not something i think many people would feel comfortable dealing with or being near um so get excited and it's difficult to put you know sizes on this you know waste paper fire, what's that? 100 kilowatts? I mean, maybe something in that order, maybe a little bit less. So difficult to, I think, because of the way the units are given, this idea of power, it's quite difficult for people to get a sense of that, I think. But fine related, a kettle is three kilowatts, right? But does that help? I don't really know, a kettle is, you know, three kilowatts, right? But does that help? I don't really know, right? You know, a hundred kettles per second, that's not a great unit of measure, right? Exactly. So I think this is one of the things that is a bit tricky. And until you see it, you know, quite a difficult measurement to wrap your head around. But the useful thing about measuring heat release rate is you can use it to track the fire growth. So fires don't normally start a maximum heat release rate, right? Normally fires grow in some way. They start small and they get bigger. And the nice thing about heat release rate is you can track the fire growth using this measurement. And we've got different ways we can measure heat release rate, which is, I think, quite useful. But we can talk about them perhaps in a minute. But nevertheless, tracking the fire size as a function of time is really, really useful in terms of how we understand the burning of individual materials, but also how we understand the burning of objects. So it's one of these kind of concepts that unifies a lot of things in fire science. So if you're running a small field test in the laboratory, for example, using the cone calorimeter, which is a device that basically allows us to impose some heating onto a material, the heating is by radiation that increases the temperature of the material. Eventually, we will reach the point where we will have a flammable mixture as the material decomposes into the fuel gases. Flammable mixture will exist above the surface of the fuel. We have a pilot flame, sorry, pilot spark in there that will ignite those gases and the material will burn. Once the material starts burning, we can measure the energy release. And if we have something like a common plastic polyethylene was an example you used before, that will burn in a way that basically very quickly it reaches kind of a maximum steady value and it will burn like that, releasing more as a constant amount of energy until we consume all the material. And then, of course, there's no fuel left, nothing to burn, so the heat release rate drops back to zero. Other materials, if you've got charring materials, so things like timber or any kind of cellulose-derived product. They're typically all charring. I mean, that means that once the sample is heated, we produce the sample gases in exactly the same way as before. We then ignite those gases, and in this case, we can track the energy release as we did before, and what we will see is the energy release immediately reaches some kind of maximum value and then decreases as the material burns. And it never reaches really a steady state, always kind of decreasing as the material burns. And that's really useful information because now we've got information that is telling us how much energy these materials are releasing and also how they're releasing that energy. And the thing about heat release rate is I mentioned before about feedbacks. It's one of the main things that drives those feedbacks. The energy that you release from the fire will determine how much energy you have available to go back to the material, to heat it up some more, to keep it burning, to spread the flame, to grow the fire that way. It will also determine the air flows that you get around. So if you have a larger heat release rate, you'll generate more buoyant air flow. A larger heat release rate, you'll generate more buoyant airflow. Larger air flows typically will, again, be a positive feedback into a fire system. So by tracking that evolution, by understanding how different materials burn and how they release the energy as they burn, you can learn a lot about how things might manifest. I have another observation, another change in the life of a fire safety engineer. So the fact that something is difficult to ignite doesn't mean it doesn't ignite and it doesn't mean it burns. It just means that this particular setting of these feedbacks that you've described is slightly different than from material that's, let's say, easy to ignite. So if you have polyethylene, it's, let's say, easy to ignite. So you need lower heat feedback. It can self-sustain the combustion simpler, quicker, easier, and just burn off. And if you have, let's say, strongly fire-retarded polyethylene, where someone has engineered modifications to this material, so it is harder to ignite. It doesn't mean it does not. It just means this whole feedback loop is on quite a different level. But if you reach that level and you get net positive heat loop in there, so by burning it, it generates more energy than it needs to ignite and keep burning, so it's net positive, it will eventually grow. And I think that's something that we observe in this facade that we brought as an example, that you can put very good materials for our standards, like very high Euro-class materials. And because of this specific way how the facade is constructed that enables a lot of interesting feedback loops inside, you may still be in the regime where, okay, it's very hard to ignite. But after you do that, it can self-sustain and propagate. Yeah, I mean, people often ask what it is that I do, fire scientists, you know, what the hell is that? And, you know, my response sometimes is a bit flippant, which is, you know, I take things obviously burn and show that they don't. And I take things that shouldn't burn and show that they do. And, you know, as long as something's got some carbon in it, I think you can usually find a way to make it burn. And you're absolutely right. This is process of something burning is all about these feedbacks. And actually, the feedback is, you know, there's quite simple expressions for that. I won't recite the equations now, but, you know, there's quite simple ways to conceptualize that problem. And basically, just because something is hard to ignite doesn't mean it won't burn. And I think those are concepts that often get sometimes a bit misused. You know, something is fire retardant. Well, that means it will still burn. Right. You know, it means it might be harder to ignite it, but it will still burn. And under some, you know, you also have to ask the question, what are the conditions that show that this is harder to ignite? Because, you know, I can guarantee you that, you know, a non-fire-retarded piece of wood and a fire-retarded piece of wood in a compartment fire, the fire retardants aren't going to be massively effective once you start having a heat flux of 100 kilowatts per square meter. So you have to be a little bit careful about how you evaluate these things. But in the end, the energy balance is what we're looking at. And if you're burning something, you have the heat feedback from the flame to the surface of the material that will keep it burning. And you will have some heat losses. And the heat losses can be in many different forms due to surface re-radiation. They can be due to conduction in depth. They can be due to literally removing mass. So if your material is melting and dripping and flowing away, there's lots of ways to manipulate this energy balance. But in the end, for something to burn, as we point out, you have to have more energy arriving at the surface than you need to pyrolyze the next piece of material. So I think this concept of fire retardants and whatever is one that is quite complex to understand in the end, because the chemical formulations can all sound a little bit tricky. But in the end, what you're basically doing is modifying that energy balance somehow you could be doing it by also changing the properties of the flame so you can make the flame release less energy you can also delay the formation of flammable mixture by producing inert gases so you can close to form water or carbon dioxide all those things can have an impact on the burning of material but it is at the end of the day a feedback and if you can close to form water or carbon dioxide. All those things can have an impact on the burning of the material, but it is, at the end of the day, a feedback. And if you can somehow retain energy in your system, then you can make something burn. And to the fire safety engineer who's listening, it's not that they don't work or they are useless. It's not about that. It's about understanding the purpose of these engineered changes to the materials. If the purpose is to make it harder to ignite by introducing these ways of additional heat losses and moving the balance away from the point, you're changing the regime in which the fire can even start. And I guess that was a classic case of ignition of a mattress by a cigarette, where you could eventually engineer the material in a way that the energy carried by this source is insufficient to ignite. Which, it's not a huge change from grand scheme of things perspective, if there's a flashover in that compartment, that sofa will burn as vigorously as another one. But you've changed the amount of fires that can happen because suddenly a common ignition source is unable to cause a fire. It's unable to pass from... Yeah, I mean, I think that's exactly the role of a fire retardant. It's to make things harder to ignite and perhaps to then slow down those early stages of fire development. So, you know, you basically, you buy time in order for people to evacuate and, you know, all of these things to happen. And there are multiple ways of doing that. And I think, you know, there are lots of statistics that show that that is successful in terms of reducing the number of fires. But the key thing, I think, to remember is that that's happening in the early stages of the fire. So if you're interested in that and you're looking at an egress calculation, for example, then I think the fire retardant issue becomes important in material selection, material choice. But the question of does the fire retardant work at the scale of a compartment fire, a facade fire, a wildfire, Those are different questions and probably different mitigation techniques to address that. There's no silver bullet in this. It's not one magical cure for everything. I would also like to point out that cigarettes change a lot, and modern cigarettes carry much less energy as an ignition source. Actually, from a fire laboratory perspective, that's quite problematic. I think the last batch of cigarettes used for the test we had to purchase in Ukraine because the Polish ones were not burning vigorously enough. You are also known as the wildfire scientist. I wonder, like we've talked about solid fuels like timber and stuff. Now looking at living fuels, like there's many, many differences. One that for me is the most obvious is, well, two are obvious to me. One is the moisture content in the fuel, and the second is its porosity. So how does that change this fundamental behavior? I guess the science is the same. You're absolutely right. For me, the way I look at this is that the science is the same. It's the same heat transfer processes, the same fluid mechanics processes, the same mass transfer issues, the same chemical reaction problems. So in many senses, I see way more similarities and differences. And I think one of these things that I get a little bit of a bee in my bonnet about is you study, you know, structure fires or wildfires. Why not both? Right. You know, you're an experiment or a modeler. Well, why not both? Right. And I think these sorts of artificial divides that we've kind of created in our in our community of the tribes, tribes, it's something that I find quite frustrating. I think the best work is done at the interface of all of these things. I find quite frustrating. I think the best work is done at the interface of all of these things. And, you know, I think that there's a lot that fire scientists can bring to the table in wildfires and in the discussion around that. And that is happening. Don't get me wrong. It's definitely happening. And I think that's extremely positive. But vice versa. There's a lot we learn as fire scientists, wildfire behaviors and the ecological aspects and all those other parts that play a role in this problem. So what I prefer to try and look at this problem is one more of commonalities than differences. Now, of course, that brings challenges when you start getting to the kind of application edge of this. If you want to build a model to predict wildfire spread, then probably you make different assumptions. And if you want to build a model to predict you know fire spread in microgravity or fire spread on a facade or whatever and that's normal i think but the the fundamental approach to studying this and the approach that i've tried to take in the work i've done is or being involved in is to you know how much can we apply the techniques and the methods of fire science into these wildland fuels, recognizing that the moisture content is super important. But that, in a way, is not simple to deal with, but you can view that as an energy thing. So you've got an energy part of the problem with the moisture, and then you've got the flame. Actually, sorry, it's very similar to what we've just discussed as fire retardant, another way to dissipate the heat that doesn't go into heating up your fuel. There are, in terms of some of the moisture content problems, that is a very nice way to think about it as more or less a heat sink. Some of the other work that's going on here shows it's a little bit more complex in the sense of, you know, is it free water or is it somehow bound? And what implications does that have? And I'm not sure we've fully resolved there's some really nice work going on around it but in the end if um for some fuels for example if you have dead fuels aren't living and that simplifies the problems mutually and we spent a long time working with with dead fuels um because of that simplification but of course if fires don't only burn in dead fuels, they also burn in these live fuels. So we need to think about that. So there's huge similarities there. In terms of the porosity issues, I think that's something that is perhaps less well understood. There's, again, really nice work around that. I think it's now becoming more mainstream, perhaps. You know, work in the U.S. Bar Service that's looking explicitly at linking the burning of wooden cribs to porous fuels. And that goes all the way back to the kind of genesis of some of these wildfire models, which were all kind of developed using wooden cribs or these sorts of manufactured synthetic porous materials. And for me, that's something that's really interesting, because it also puts you on the edge of having a flaming fire and a smoldering fire as soon as you bring in this process. So you change also the mode of burning here as well. But we don't shift it into a world that we don't understand. I mean, we've been studying smoldering combustion since the 1950s, if not since before then. We understand all these things. 50s, if not since before then. We understand all these things. So for me, wildfire and the propagation of wildfires, if you look at it through the lens of fire safety engineering, there's a lot you can contribute. And, you know, it's not the only way of solving the problem. I'm wise enough and old enough to recognize that, you know, there's more than one way to skin a cat, but there's a lot that we can do. And I think that that, for me, has been one of the most interesting parts of my career so far, is looking at how far you can push that. Which of our fire engineering techniques make the most sense in the different settings? Measuring the heat release rate, for example, that's still a pretty good way to go, try to understand the effects of ferocity or moisture content on burning a fuel, measuring the mass loss rate. You know, these are things that we do all the time in fire science that help you to understand how these different materials are going to burn. So from my point of view, there's not really a difference. I mean, I wear these two hats because I feel like I'm made to wear these two hats. When you talk to people, you know, wildfires are somehow different from fire. But I don't know. It's the same hat just turned backwards, I guess. Okay. I had an episode with Sarah McAllister on the podcast, and we were talking about the combustion of different scales. And at some points, we also ventured in this weird place where I was talking about opening factors in combatant fires. She was talking about porous creeps, and we realized it's essentially the same thing. In the end, how air can penetrate your source of fire. So it also reaffirms your view that it's the same thing. It's just a little different scale or different application of the knowledge. For the end, something that was mentioned here many times, measuring fires. I think that's also a fascinating thing to understand. How does one actually measure fire? I think maybe you'll agree, but I think the moment where fire scientists achieved ability to measure fire in terms of heat to release rate was one of the biggest turning points in the history of the discipline. Like we've finally received a tool that can quantify the fire itself, not the consequences of it, right? Yeah. I mean, I think the ability to measure the energy that's released by a fire, I think it did transform our way to look. There's a paper by Barouskis, isn't there, that says, you know, heat release rate is the most important variable in fire science or something like that. It's the title. And rate is the most important variable in fire science or something like that is the title. And I think that goes back to the conversation we were having before about how the energy release drives so much of the feedbacks and the other processes that are going on. And the ability to measure it came, I suppose, once the diagnostics had become sufficiently advanced, I guess, in the 70s and in the early 1980s, in order to measure using the technique of oxygen consumption calorimetry, which is, you know, it's a pretty robust method measuring the energy release that's based on an understanding of chemistry at one end and then the ability to measure the amount of oxygen that has been consumed by the reaction on the other end. So if we tackle the chemistry bit to begin with, that's pretty fundamental in terms of how this works, is that, you know, for most things that we burn from a chemical point of view are pretty similar, right? They're made of carbon, they're made of hydrogen, sometimes they have some oxygen in there as well. Of course, we have exotic things that will have other stuff, you know, PVC will have some chlorine in it and polyurethane will have some nitrogen in there. But mostly these things are made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. And if you understand the way that energy is released in a fire, I mean, it's made by breaking bonds for which you have to put energy in and then bonds reforming to make new molecules. In the case of a fire, that's usually carbon dioxide and water. The reason that a fire can spread, it can grow, is because it releases more energy than it requires to break those bonds. If you think of it in terms of those chemical terms, you've got fuels that are broadly quite similar, products of combustion that are basically always the same, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide maybe, some water. And what we're actually looking at are the ratios of bonds, right? How many bonds do I break? How many bonds do I form? And once you start breaking down to that level, you can see, well, again, there's more similarities and differences between the fuel. And, you know, some work was done, I think actually the first work was done like a long time ago. I can't remember the paper, but it was by Thornton. Yeah, there's some work from Thornton. He found that basically you always get the same amount of energy per kilogram of oxygen. That's like 1920s. That's really hundreds of years old. And then it took the guys at NIST a little while, I guess, to figure out how to make the diagnosis work on this. Oh, exactly. And then, you know, so in the 1970s or so, once we had the ability to measure oxygen concentrations in a relatively simple way, we were able to develop this idea of the oxygen consumption calorimetry. And really, I mean, you simply you measure how much oxygen you have in the air, which is normally always 21 percent. And then you ignite something and you keep measuring the air. And as you burn the object, reduce the amount of oxygen that's in the exhaust stream. And, you know, by doing some calculations to turn concentration into a mass, you can figure out how much energy is released. The magic number that you need to convert between all this is something that you hear fire scientists talk about a lot, this so-called 13.1 megajoules per kilogram oxygen. It's an average. I mean, some materials, it's a bit higher. For some, it's a little bit lower. But in terms of our ability to make the measurement, usually that's good enough. And it's also really powerful because it means we don't have to worry about what we're burning anymore. If you're burning individual pure materials, then fine, you can go and look up, you know, is it 13.1, 13.2, you know, is it 12.9, whatever. But if you're burning something like couch or, you know, something that is a composite or made of many materials, then this 13.1 number is then very useful. It also means that we have to take measurements in that context. It may be no sense to report three decimal places, the heat release rate of your fire, but the technique is so powerful in letting us get some handle on that fire size. There's a lot of tricks in there, though. The process is not one that is super easy to follow. And I would encourage people to go and look at the original work and unpick that calculation. There's a lot in there that is translating from the general concept that I've just described to implementing it, to making those measurements, using those technologies. It's not quite so straightforward. But that's the joy of it, I think, is finding these devils in the details. The other way to measure heat release rate that I think is really know, is finding these devils in the details. The other way to measure heat release rate, I think, is really powerful as well, is just by measuring the weight of the thing that's burning. If you measure the mass of it, and we know roughly the heat of combustion, that gives you a separate way to try and evaluate the energy that's being released. And again, that can be quite complex if you're burning not pure materials, because what is the heat of combustion of a couch? I mean, I don't know. But, you know, it can give you a sanity check on these numbers. And I think the nice thing about the mass loss technique is that's something that you can employ at different scales, right? And it's relatively to do that. So one of the things, again, coming back to my time in the wildfire world, one of the things I've been trying to do there is, you know, which of our usual techniques can we take out of the lab and into the woods? We can't put a giant extraction system on top of the forest that we would need to measure the heat release rate by oxygen consumption calorimetry, but we can maybe put a load cell underground, you know, build a platform and put a load cell there. So the mass loss technique, I think, is pretty useful from that point of view. It's a little bit more adaptable. It's a little more robust. You only need to make one measurement. It's only one piece of hardware that you need. So I think looking at the techniques, and you asked the question of our ability to measure fires has improved massively, which it totally has. But I think the other thing we have to remember as scientists is, you know, why do we want to make the measurement? What is going on here? And I think when it comes to measuring fires, I always think that there's kind of two levels of the measurement. There's like the global measurement. So that could be the heat release rate. For example, in a wildfire, it might be the rate of spread in the wildfire. And that's one of the really useful things to characterize a fire. But then I'm always interested in the next level down, you know, why is that the spread rate that we have? Why is that the heat release rate that we have? And that's where we were able to kind of pull back on all those ideas we talked about in terms of what is a flame, understanding the processes that drive a flame, understanding heat transfer mechanisms that result in the feedback. So we live in an age where people before us made it easy to make these measurements. Now what I think the age that we're living in is the why. Why is that the heat leak rate? Why is that the rate of spread of a wildfire? Why is that the rate of spread on a facade? Why is that the fire growth rate in my timber compartment? And I think those questions are much more interesting forms of question than just how big or how fast or whatever. Because once you know the why, you can then actually start to engineer systems and products and materials much, much better. There's one more way, which is extremely hard, but I know there was an attempt. Technically, it's a release of heat. So by solving the complete heat transfer of your whole thermodynamic system of your compartment, you can do that. And there was this Edinburgh tall building experiment. I think one made quite a decent attempt on figuring out from heat transfer. But that's hardcore, right? It's not easy to solve that where I think we have to think carefully about what measurements do you want to make and why. You know, if you want to solve that problem in that way, you need to make a very different set of measurements than if you want to solve it in a different way. This is, for me, is now the hard part, because we do have a lot of toys at our disposal. We've got lots of ways of measuring things, mass loss, temperature, heat flux, energy release, whatever. We can do it, right? We can even shine lasers into flames to look at the destruction. You can see where the ions are in the flame exactly, like OH group, where is it? And you can actually map that in real time. It's amazing. You can do all of these things. The question I always end up coming back to is, do you want to do it? How does it help you just to take a step forward? Because sometimes I think the most difficult thing is having lots of data and then not being able to see the wood for the trees, right? But I think the little bit of experience that I've developed over the years is, think really hard ahead of time about the measurement that you want to make, make that measurement really well, and then try to complement that measurement in the context of your problem. Because these days, yes, we can measure everything. The question is, is it desirable to do that? You know, is it going to actually help you? Do you have, you know, three years to spend crunching through all that data or whatever? So I think, you know, we've moved on from the age of how to make the measurements. Now, I think, as I said, it's about what do those measurements mean? Wow. Fantastic. That was a fantastic journey. It might be my new one of the favorite episodes. Thanks, Rory, for that. I would like to place an advertisement on your behalf. I know that University of Edinburgh is starting a new master's in 5-6 engineering. You already had a structural one, like you're very well known for a structural course. So maybe you can tell anyone listening who would like to pursue a formal education in 5-6 engineering. What's in the offer from Edinburgh nowadays? As you said, yeah, we've had an MSc since the 1970s. The MSc started by Dougal Drysdale, Professor Raspash and Eric Marchand. And we have a long history of teaching fire in Edinburgh. What we've launched for students starting in 2023 is a new version of that MSc that I think reflects more the needs of fire engineering today. The MSc focuses on really delivering a solid grounding in the basics of fire science. The MSc is called fire engineering science. So it's really trying to put at the forefront of fire engineering, the concepts and the scientific principles that underpin the discipline. So, you know, we draw on areas of combustion, heat and mass transfer, and of course, the fire engineering itself and how you apply these sorts of things. We also have as part of the class, as part of the degree, practical work in the laboratory as well. So, you know, being exposed to making the kinds of measurements you've been speaking about, understanding the complexities of that, understanding the value of some measurements under different contexts, looking at standardized test methods as well, you know, and analyzing the data from them. So hopefully exciting kind of broad education in fire engineering science. So the graduates can go into careers where, you know, they're talking about the important concept of fire science to underpin the issues around whether it's timber buildings, facades, wildfires. Really, the idea is to try and create the broadest possible spectrum for fire engineers. And so we're excited by it. We'll make sure that the link is in the cast episode somehow. If people are interested in finding out more or applying, they can, of course, feel free to get in touch. interested in planning out more or applying or they can of course feel free uh to get in touch and yeah you heard the man the master's program is this exact podcast episode by but spread out over two years and spread out over one year amazing one year just yeah one year okay yeah cool rory thanks for doing this it was amazing talking to you all right and that's it a very brief introduction to combustion in flame for fire safety engineering. I hope you've enjoyed that. Let me know what you think about this type of content and I will try to bring more if you like it. There's so many subjects that could be covered in this way with some all-stars of the fire discipline. I always found it very interesting to learn the basics from the best. It's usually a very interesting experience to actually try and listen to what the world's brightest minds have to say about the most fundamental phenomena. And you always learn something. As I said, I have learned a lot during this interview, and I have enjoyed talking to Rory a lot. So I hope that this type of content can be interesting for any type of fire engineer. I don't think there is much to add in here outside of three books that you definitely should have on your bookshelf. I'm going to link these titles in the show notes. There's an introduction to fire dynamics by Dougal Drysdale, an absolute classic. There are Fundamentals of Fire Phenomena by Quinn Thieriri and Enclosure of Fire Dynamics by Quintiri and Carlson, three magnificent books that cover so many aspects of fundamental fire engineering. And if in your career path, you've never had a chance to go through them, I absolutely recommend that because there's not many other places in the world of fire science where you can learn as much as reading through these masterpieces. Anyway, I won't prolong this too much. I'm still recovering from my flu. As every good employee, I took my week off after Christmas and got a nasty flu. I spent most of it in bed. Still recovering, but it's going good. So yeah, I'll go back to rest and hope to see you here back next Wednesday. And there's another episode waiting for you. And next week's going to be quite interesting for the podcast, I think. So you rather don't want to miss that. Cheers. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
