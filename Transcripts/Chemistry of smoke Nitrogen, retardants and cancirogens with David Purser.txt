 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today we're here with the final episode with Professor David Purser on toxicity and toxicological hazards related to fire smoke and fires in general. And this serves as a, let's say, a summary to the previous content. So, we've learned a lot about how chemicals are produced in fires. We've learned a lot how we measure them. Today we're going to learn a bit more about the role of nitrogen. We're going to learn a bit more about how fire retardants can change the fire atmosphere and the toxicological hazards related to fires. We're going to learn about smoke not only inside the building, but also outside the building, and the dangers related to, let's say, wildfire smoke or large chemical fires that can affect whole cities. And in the end, we're going to also learn about some more long-lasting hazards related to cancerogens and properties of smoke that are related to cancerous hazards, and what parts of our profession are particularly exposed to such hazards. So, another great episode with David, another episode jam-packed with chemistry, perhaps, again, a little difficult one to digest, but definitely full of great knowledge, jest, but definitely full of great knowledge, full of great examples, full of interesting stories from the life of an amazing, amazing scientist who is one of the most impactful figures in the field of toxicology and fires, undoubtedly this year's recipient of Howard Emmons Plenary Lecture at the FSS. The biggest honor that a fire scientist can have. So I'm very, very happy for the full time to have David Purser in the Fire Science Show. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode.

And we've ended the discussion coming into the role of nitrogen in fires. So let's continue on nitrogen. So just to go a little bit further on the nitrogen thing, as I was saying, when you burn carbon in a fire, when it's well ventilated, you get lots of carbon dioxide, which is a fully oxidized version of carbon. And as you become underventilated, the carbon dioxide yield starts to fall off in a predictable way. But when you measure carbon monoxide, there's none under well-ventilated conditions. And that increases as you get underventilated. Well, exactly the same sort of thing happens with nitrogen. So when you've got organic nitrogen in your fuel, if you burn it under well-ventilated conditions, you get oxides of nitrogen produced, NO and NO2, NOx, which you know is under well-ventilated conditions, which we know is a big, big problem in automobile engines. They deal a lot with that in road tunnels, where we need to calculate NOx production from diesel engines, and it's difficult to manage, yes. Now, in engines, probably most of it's coming from nitrogen in the air. In this case, I'm talking mainly about nitrogen products, from the organic nitrogen in the fuel that we're burning, which is... Are there many more organic materials, plastics, that would have nitrogen in the structure besides polyurethane. Yeah, there's a whole load of them. And to some extent, they're more common in our environment than they were years ago. So, of course, you've got a classic one is polyamide nylon, which gives a lot of cyanide when it's burned. I've done a lot of work with that. And then you've got, obviously, the polyurethane. So the stuff you've got in your furniture, which is flexible polyurethane foams, they have quite a bit of nitrogen. And there's another material called polyacrylonitrile, which is used to make various fabrics for clothing and for covering furniture, which is high in nitrogen. It produces quite a bit of cyanide when it's burned. And then you've got the rigid foam materials that are used in construction, which also have a quite a lot. So there's quite a few. I think we work with this material actually a lot and it's increasing. Poly isocianurate, PIR. They are used a lot as thermal insulation and elements of facades. I've done a lot of work with PIR. That gives off quite a bit of cyanades. I've done a lot of work with PIR, and that gives off quite a bit of timeline. Actually, the plastics that involve nitrogen in their structure would be commonly found in buildings, not only in your upholstery, where you would find PU, but also within the structure of the building, even, in the form of those, maybe, foams that are used to insulate it, or some other. But it's okay. I just wanted to have a quick overview how relevant the nitrogen discussion is. And you may remember last time we spoke, I was saying that getting some kind of feel for the nitrogen content of your burning fuel is important and can have quite a big consequence. So if you think of most cellulosic materials, which only have 1 or 2% nitrogen in, then any toxicity is going to be dominated by the carbon content, because the nitrogen content is so low to start with. When you get something like a single armchair burning, which is an insulation panel that has a high nitrogen content, say 10% or so, then you need to consider carefully how much cyanide you might get if it burns in your particular scenario. But if you look at the total fuel load in a building, then as I was saying last time, it tends to be very much dominated by the cellulosic components. If you think of your office, I look around me now it's full of books and wouldn't show any... I have a pulsed wall, so mine is full of good old nitrogen. Oh, well, there you are. You better get out quick. Sorry, I mean, that's the sort of thing that happened at the station nightclub, for example, which was a very, very rapid urethane burning fire. Okay, I broke your train of thought, and it was intriguing. So you said that in well-oxidated conditions, the main products would be NO, NOx. Actually, the main product still is N2, which is harmless. There is a significant or can be a significant yield of NO or NOx. And so we worry about that because it's an irritant, a lung irritant. But once you get to as the equipment pressure goes above 1, you find all that NOx nearly all disappears because you're now under ventilated conditions. So just CO2 disappears. So NO disappears. Are you with me? And what we start to see is the non-oxygen-containing components coming up, or less oxygen-containing. So we start to get CO coming up. We start to get HCN coming up, right, as a product. So they're kind of mirror images. The CO2 and the NOx drops away and the CO and the HCN comes up in terms of yield as we get into more underventilated combustion condition. That was the point I was making. So basically, these are the sort of phenomena that are going on. As I said, what we set out to do as we developed this over the years was to come up with an apparatus where we could measure these things for different individual fuel materials get them to burn with a flame so we're really interested in flaming combustion and one of the requirements of the test if you're doing it properly is that you observe to make sure it's burning with a flame throughout the run so it must be burning with a flame and then you know the defined oxygen fuel ratio and you know the temperature because you've got the furnace temperature measured and we calibrate all that. So then you can then correlate or define your yields of your products against those criteria. Is it burning with a flame? What's the sort of temperature regime that we're operating in what's the sort of temperature regime that we're operating in, and what is the fuel-air ratio. And you then measure the yields of all the products of interest that you're interested in doing. So, and then you can produce plots of those as a function of equivalence ratio for a known temperature regime. And as I said, I've tried to fit algebraic expressions to these curves, as Artie Jewison did, and you'll find them in the handbook, both mine and R.T.'s. What we get is a sort of sigmoid curve as a function of equivalence ratio of yield. So I fitted Weibull expressions to my curves to try and capture that sigmoid shape. But what was very, very important to me was these yields that I'm getting under these conditions I've defined in my apparatus, do you get the same yields under the same defined conditions in Archie's apparatus? And more importantly, do you get the same result in something like an ISO room test or a compartment fire test? in something like an ISO room test or a compartment fire test. Now, of course, the problem is that the data that we've got for multiple repeat tests under ranges of equivalence ratios in full-scale compartment fire tests is quite small because they're complicated and difficult to do. So it's a limited data set. But we do have some. I've done quite a few. And then there's the work, you'll find some in the handbook, Byler's work, Pitts and various people like that. So we do have a bit of a database of known fuels decomposed under a range of combustion conditions in compartment fires for which we can measure the equivalence ratio conditions produced them. And we can measure the yields of CO with time etc in these tests and so what I've done was it's the last paper I published on this was to compare the yields I was getting in the tube furnace with the yields measured as a function of these parameters in compartmental fire tests and I feel we're getting pretty good agreement and certainly quite good agreement with Archie's TIFs. So this makes me feel confident. We're measuring phenomena that are not apparatus dependent, they're not test dependent, they're physics dependent or chemistry dependent. We're defining what we will get. I'm saying if you set up these conditions, you should observe something pretty close to what I'm measuring. Whatever apparatus you use, providing that you're careful to define your conditions. And this is one of the problems I've found with the tube furnace, is that I feel I nurtured this wonderful baby in my laboratory, and now it's grown up to be a rebellious teenager. People are using it around the world in all sorts of ways that perhaps they're not being as careful as they should be about quickly measuring their parameters and getting some some people are getting some odd results but what we found is that you have to be very very very careful particularly to measure accurately your air supply it's quite easy to measure the mass presentation rate of the fuel if you just set up an injection device at a constant rate. But people seem to not be able to accurately measure their air flows. And so if you get your air flow wrong, you get your actual fuel-air ratio can be very different from your nominal fuel-air ratio, and you get funny results. And so to try and deal with that in the more recent version of the standards on this, we've told people to do test runs with PMMA and known fuels like that under certain conditions, and they have to make sure they get certain results to demonstrate that they've correctly set up the apparatus before they start with unknown materials. And doing that, we're finding things have improved. So basically you're making them make sure they are in the same apparatus-independent regime as you were with TOWAS. Yeah, exactly. You've got to calibrate things very accurately. Because the problem is this apparatus is something you more or less have to build yourself. You can't just buy it off the shelf like a cone carimeter. So, you know, some cone carimeters... I'm pretty sure there's a company who can sell you one. Well, there are one or two. I mean, the cone carimeter, for example, is very widely used and the bugs have been ironed out on its physical use of the apparatus. So, that's not really quite the case. We are proud owners of one person's furnace in our laboratory and we like it. Well, so I'm pleased with that. I cannot guarantee we're using it correctly though, after all of this. Please contact me if you have any problems. So I think we're getting somewhere. I think we now have a handle on a better understanding of the main criteria that determine the yields of things under fire conditions. I mean, we do find some differences. For a given equivalence ratio, if you operate at sort of 900 degrees centigrade, you slightly get different yields from if you operate at 600 degrees centigrade, with a flame, and both cases. And that's understandable in terms of chemical dynamics, which is a complicated subject. That's what I just wanted to ask you about, maybe. Maybe you can help me. I have two. Now as I understand how the yields and properties of the products are measured, I wonder, I want two things. One is to what extent is my upper layer in a compartment fire, to what extent can the furnace really well capture these conditions? Is it really the same thing? And the second thing is to what extent these things would be dynamic, you know? Like to what extent the products directly above my plume would be different from a mixed smoke, let's say, 20 meters away? How quick? All very excellent questions. Let's start with the compartment fire. Let's think of a compartment fire. One distinction I want to make is between other apparatus, a bit like the cone parameter or like Archer's apparatus where you have a static fuel and a dynamic air flow. So you just have a, the fuel is in terms of a sort of circular plate isn't it? In most of these apparatus. And then you irradiate it from above with the cone parameter or from the side in Archer's apparatus and you heat that up, and it starts to decompose and burn with the flame. And you measure the mass loss rate of your fuel, and certainly in Archer's apparatus, you can measure the air, combustion air. One of the issues with this approach, or features of this approach, is that if you're burning something like polypropylene, that will then melt into a hydrocarboncarbon fuel and will then paralyze off at a certain rate in the combustion zone. And the composition of the aerosolized fuel, pyrolyzate, before it's combusted will be fairly constant until it's all gone. It doesn't change in composition during the test. If you take something like a lump of wood, then it's very different because the wood starts off as being wood with all the volatiles in the wood, which then starts to pyrolyse and burn with the flame. And then gradually the carbon content of what's left increases until you get a chore left at the end. And so the composition of the burning fuel and the pyrolysis that's coming off that fuel changes throughout the duration of the test. And that's okay, but you have to be aware that that's what's going on. When we're doing CFD analysis, or when we're thinking of combustion in the upper layer, or in the combustion zone of a fire, we're really thinking about the composition of the gaseous components, not the solid left behind. So in this case, we've got a changing fuel. So if you think of a lump of charcoal, the only thing you've got to get off that is carbon, which you heat it up. Whereas if it was wood, there's all sorts of stuff comes off wood in the early stages. Whereas in the tube furnace, we're burning fresh material all the time. So what's happening in the tube furnace is more, I would say, analogous to what's happening in a spreading fire. If I have a wooden table and somebody leaves a candle at one end and sets fire to one end of the table, then the flame zone moves along the table to spreads and expanding circle to involve more and more fresh material all the time. Or if I'm set fire to a wall lining, the flame goes up the wall and increases the new material. So real fires are spreading fires. Compartment fires are spreading fires. And so what we're doing in a tube, it sort of replicates the spreading fire type scenario rather than just a lump of fuel. So when you have virgin fuel and it decomposes the early stages of the composition as it ignites, loses the first volatiles. Yeah, that's right. So we have a bit of both in ours. But then you think about what's happening above your burning fuel. So above your burning fuel, you have what we call the plume, fire plume coming off above the fuel, which is entraining air. And that's where we get primary combustion zone, where the flames are. And that's where we have our fuel air ratio, equivalence ratio in our burning flaming plume. And there's a parameter called the plume equivalence ratio that people mention. and there's a parameter called the plume equivalence ratio that people mention. I think what we're doing more or less replicates that plume equivalence ratio situation. Then the products of combustion then go into the upper layer. And as I say, most of the work I've done, large-scale fires I'm looking at, or underventilated fires, we have quite a deep upper layer and the flames are penetrating into the underventilated upper layer because you've got less oxygen up there. You're getting quite underventilated conditions in your upper layer. And as that flows away from the combustion zone, the temperature drops. Once the temperature drops, the chemistry slows right down. So essentially, the upper layer is very low in oxygen. Usually most of the oxygen is gone. And so if you've got a layer a metre deep flowing away from your flame zone horizontally towards, say, a doorway, then most of the entrainment is happening close to the burning fuel. There's some, but it's limited entrainment into the upper layer remote as it flows away. And as the temperature drops, the chemistry starts to freeze. And so the relative composition of the different, say, carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide ratio becomes constant, becomes thick as the plume cools down and moves away from the combustion zone. as the plume cools down and moves away from the combustion zone. Well, you can get secondary combustion as if you, for some reason, introduce fresh air into that plume while it's still at sort of 600, 700, 900 degrees centigrade. Then, of course, you'll get further combustion. And you may be aware of this famous paper that I think Pitts and Co. did, where they looked at the global equivalence ratio, particularly, and they tried introducing air into a vitiated hot upper flume when they got further combustion in there. Of course, that can happen. And in tube flow, we have the potential to examine this phenomena by putting the atmosphere through the tube and heating it to different temperatures. If you take that fuel-rich atmosphere and put it through the tube and heating it to different temperatures. If you take that fuel-rich atmosphere and put it through another tube and then heat it up or cool it down, you can investigate those conditions, but you'd have to set them up as a separate entity. My God, if any students are listening, just take down notes, because these are brilliant pieces. I mean, what I... It needs to be done. I'm a little bit frustrated, because to me, the tube furnace and other type variants of it are such a wonderful platform to investigate all these phenomena. There's so many tunes you could play on it by very... having maybe two tubes in series with different heaters around them. I love it. Or by putting various gases in. And, I mean, one of the things, for example, we've looked at is, another question you should ask me is, if I have one steel burning, say I have wood burning, and I get a certain condition and a certain CO2-CO ratio, and then next to it I have a lump of PVC burning and the two plumes mixed, will the yield of CO from the wood be affected by the yield of hydrogen chloride from the PVC? You see where I'm going here? And I'd say the answer is, if you burn them as two completely separate fuel packages and only mix the plume where the temperatures drop down to sort of below 400 centigrade, then they'll just be additive. Parallel tubes then they're just additive. Parallel tubes. They're just parallel sources of material in a compartment far or anywhere. So you could treat each fuel as independently acting and just putting smoke up into the upper layer, right? But if you had your PVC intimately connected with the wood, so that both are burning together, then you'd expect to see a big increase in the CO yield from the wood component, because the chlorine atoms in this flame plume are going to reduce the efficiency of combustion of the carbon from the wood. Now, I know this is theoretical, but it has actually been done. I think Anna did a bit, and I've done a little bit in the two films, but there was a very nice experiment done years ago in an ISO room corridor rig. I like room corridor rigs rather than a simple ISO room. So this is, many years ago, we used to have this at BRE, so we had an ISO room with a doorway, and the doorway opened to a corridor which goes at right angles across from the um room and then the end of the corridor which might be i don't know 20 meters long to 15 meters long you'd have your hood and so this is a very interesting piece of kit because you can generate your fire in the iso room and then you can have the plume and it relates back to your previous question you have the plume, and it relates back to your previous question, you have the plume flowing down, the hot plume flowing down as a ceiling layer down the corridor, then coming out of the, into the hood at the end where you can measure the product. But in these experiments, which were done many years ago, we took, well, I wasn't involved in them personally, but Peter Fardell and his colleagues took samples of smoke from the plume as it moved down the corridor. So when it first comes out of the room, it's very hot. Well, unless it moves down the corridor and there's some entrainment from the air below, it cools down. And they did, in fact, find some, when they're close to the very hot area, they did find getting some oxidation of the carbon monoxide to CO2 as it went down the corridor and there was some entrainment. So the monoxide decreased, the concentration of monoxide was... You know, something like that. But also, one of the tests they did was they built... These are 100 kilogram cribs, wood cribs, you know what they are? So you build a 100 kilogram crib and they were burned to completion in these tests. In one of the tests, they replaced the upper quarter of the rig with PVC. So the energy is mainly coming from the burning wood crib, but the top half of the crib is PVC. And they unfortunately didn't have the equipment to measure hydrogen chloride. But what they did find was a big increase in the CO yield. And what's happening was that the PVC was, I think, affecting the combustion efficiency of the wood. So there are all sorts of interesting games one could play, experimentally and PhD-wise, on looking at all these phenomena. Very interesting. Everyone's familiar with catalyzers for combustion engines, where you put a piece of platinum to make the exhaust less toxic because you complete the combustion of them. So I guess the chloride is doing something opposite and it slows down the reactions or affects the capability of the instructions to cure. So this is brilliant. And another level of complexity I have not even thought about, like how different radicals present in the atmosphere where the combustion is happening will influence the reactions that happen. They're brilliant. With particular halogens, because this is the principle of a lot of fire-tolerant additives. That's why they're put in there. It's very interesting. The good side of them is that they make it less likely that you're going to have a fire ignited in the first place. It seems to be the same mechanism, maybe even, actually. Well, it is. The good thing is that if you think of all the possible ignition sources that might attack your material, your product, the probability that you get ignition in the first place is reduced if you've got some fire retardants in there and hopefully if you do get ignition you'll then get a slower growing fire and there is some evidence for that but the downside is that if you do get a large fire developing the yields of toxic products are to be higher of needle toxic products like slow and of course you're infusing fresh toxic products from the retardants themselves so there's a trade-off there and there's, and of course you're infusing fresh toxic products from the retardants themselves. So there's a trade-off there, and of course there's a whole, as we were discussing, there's a whole another field of consideration there about where we should be going with fire retardants, flame retardants, and a whole new sort of field of environmentally friendly flame retardants that can hopefully achieve some improvement in performance without producing a lot of or giving us a lot of toxic products both from the actual use as manufacturing use in the environment and when they're involved in fires. David I would like to tie the previous interview to this one. In the previous interview we opened it with view on the fires in 40s, 50s, that they were less harmful to the participants. And then observations that towards 70s, 80s, with the change of materials and stuff, the toxicity has increased. Now, based on what we've said today, it seems that the fires became bigger and because of them being bigger, they consume oxygen better, meaning they get higher equivalence ratios, less efficient combustions, and the products increase exponentially with that change. Do you find this the reason of this increased toxicity? The fires grow bigger, they're faster, and equivalence ratios are different? Yeah, this is where some complexity does come in. We did a series of experiments in these room corridor rigs and also in a house. We had a typical suburban house where we did a series of armchair type fires in the lounge of the house with the lounge doorway open and one bedroom upstairs open. So they had a fire room and an extension beyond it, but otherwise it was enclosed. So these were enclosed fires. We did find a slightly anomalous result in the real world that you wouldn't find if you didn't go and look for it in the whole, in the full scale. If you didn't replicate the full scale scenario properly, you would not necessarily observe this. And it was something along the lines of the yield per gram of fuel burned of the more retardant treated materials was somewhat higher. So you might get more CO grams per gram of material burned because of these inefficiencies that you're introducing. But when we ignite the fire in an enclosed space, you get a layer descending from the ceiling, right? Vitiated layer descending from the ceiling. And as more and more of the fire plume, flame plume from the fuel, gets into this upper layer, you start to suppress the fire because it's oxygen depleted. you start to suppress the fire because it's oxygen depleted. When the oxygen concentration in this upper layer gets down to a certain level, the fire goes out because by the time the layer is ascended by a meter or two, nearly all the flame of your burning chair is burning in sort of in more or less in the upper layer and once that upper layer oxygen concentration gets down to about 15 oxygen the fire goes out right 10 to 15 oxygen what we found was with the armchairs that were not treated with retardants the fire would keep burning longer in a later oxygen concentration in the upper layer in the environment. And because it burned for longer before it self-extinguished, it would produce more toxic products. And not only that, because it was burning in a more under-ventilated equivalence ratio conditions, the yield of CO went up and cyanide went up. See what I'm getting at? So because it was, by alas, the large the flame retardant treated material, the whole fire went out at a lesser level of oxygen depletion. So at higher oxygen concentration. Yeah. So, sorry, I've forgotten to say was, remember I said this scenario we had, the fire burnt in the room when the layer got below the soffit of the doorway, the fluid flowed out through the doorway into the hallway and upstairs in the house, right? And then that layer filled down outside. And one of the things we measured was the oxygen concentration of the air in the doorway near ground level. So this is the air coming into the room to feed the fire. So that, at a certain point during the process, that would start to drop, because the stuff that's going out and filling the house is oxygen depleted, and that's then coming back into the fire. So this is all going on. So you set that fire. You set that fire with a modern fire-retardant-treated armchair. It would burn for a period of time, but when the oxygen had only depleted a certain amount, the fire would go out, and then the house is full of what's been produced up to that point. And there would be quite a lot of carbon dioxide and stuff in there. But if you took one that was not treated, which would burn more easily, then it would keep burning for a longer period to a lower level of oxygen depletion, more oxygen depletion. would keep burning for a longer period to a lower level of oxygen depletion, more oxygen depletion. And because it was doing that, you ended up with a greater amount of product. When that fire went out, the house was full of more smoke, more products. So there's some interesting complexities in the full-scale performance of all those things, which I thought was quite interesting in that set of data that we produced, which is published, in fact. And what about the toxicity of the halone products from the retardant? Well, the main thing you've got there is the hydrogen chloride and maybe hydrogen bromide, depending on some phosphorus products. So they're certainly irritant. Without the irritants, they're just... That was a whole hour of discussion the last time, so let's not go there again. But because I have the final part of the interview, we were... So far, we were talking about these major products, like you even referred to monoxide and CO2 as the major products. There were minor products like HCN and I guess the Holland products. I wonder now, we are considering so far the environment of the fire as related to the maybe the building in which the fire is happening. But with the growing understanding of built environment as a whole thing, for example, our group is researching what's happening in the surroundings of the building, like in the building next door or maybe in the far remote parts of the building you are at. And obviously, the concentrations of these toxic products that cause acute damage, like CO or HCN, they will be very strongly diluted if we are considering a building 100 meters away. But still, there are products that may come from fire, either carcinogens or maybe some of the super toxicants that we were discussing last time that are produced that could eventually be harmful, and people could be exposed to them even far away from the fires. And I think an emerging field, in building fires, this may not be such a huge problem. You very rarely have these huge fires in your cities, but so many cities are next to wildfire areas. And you have these massive plumes that actually change the color of your sky. So if the color of your sky has changed, it means your breathing is not clean of anything. So there must be a lot of products in there. So let's talk about this accidental exposure to fire smoke far away from the fire itself, what you can find in the smoke and what is produced. Yes, I have had some involvement with this. Yes, environmental hazards. So what is acute and the chronic? So the question is, if there's a fire incident near me and I get exposed outside for a day, say, to smoke, what are the hazards from that? And then the other problem is if there's combustion processes going on all the time, or I'm a firefighter or I'm a fire investigator, are they coming into contact with these fires or the fire deposits on a repeat basis over my working career? Or if I'm exposed to combustion products because there's a factory next door, the combustion process, or busy traffic in a road, where are we going with all that? So basically, yes, exactly as you say, it's quite interesting. If you think of the acute hazards from, say, a fire in a factory or a fire in a burning building, then the way I looked at this when we were producing one of our first standards on this was to think of three zones or hazard zones. And the first hazard zone would be inside the building. And inside the building, what we're really concerned about, for occupants of the building during a fire, is all the stuff we've been discussing. Can I survive exposure to this fire plume and get out alive? Well, in that terms, of course, we're most concerned about things like carbon monoxide and selenide and smoke and all the things we've been discussing. So whether somebody will survive and escape, and to some extent the irritants. But once we get outside the building, we've immediately got the dilution factor, depending on where the smoke plume is blowing and what's happening to the plume coming from the building, of 10 to 100 times. So when we do that, we find that all these asphyxiant gases and these sort of major toxic products that kill people in fires are diluted to more or less harmless levels, and they're not really a hazard at all. So if you were to calculate the FED from those, it's very low. Negligible. Negligible, yeah. Negligible, nothing, really. Although I'm going to contradict myself now, because a colleague of mine, when I asked him about this, was a fireman who used to go fight wildfires. And they didn't wear a full BA when they're fighting these wildfires, which is another problem. And I can't remember now, but I did find some data somewhere that firefighters without BA fighting wildfires can get a significant blood carboxyemoglobin. Not usually enough to cause incapacitation, but they are picking some up. You know, there is some there. For most people who are in the area around a burning building, it's not really the asphyxian gases we're concerned about. I sort of think of zone one as inside the building. Zone two would be within, say say 100 meters of the building where you might have emergency services or firefighters who are not wearing ba the managers and officers and then because they're not wearing ba they're likely to get exposed to some smoke so what's the problem there well i would say the main problem there is the irritant in the smoke irritant thereant. The smoke, octopus and irritants are acute, a minor, mostly, in most cases, a minor acute health hazard that would cause you to maybe get a sore throat the next day or something like that and might sting your eyes at the time a bit, be a bit unpleasant. But you should make a complete recovery from that. You shouldn't really expect to have any long... From a single... So you spend a couple of hours at a fire scene during a national fire. I wrote down 0.5 ppm for acrolein. So 0.5 ppm, that's like nothing. Well, no, acrolein is an irritant. Because irritancy works over such a large, orderless magnitude, you could sense it. Yeah. The smell, the odor, and the irritancy affects people at very, very low concentrations. So we are interested in the concentrations of these irritant chemicals. And they can also be good for your chest, your lungs. And I may have mentioned last time, I used to be on this air pollution committee, and one of the things that was monitored in Britain and London was the particulate PM10 and PM2.5 concentration throughout the year on a daily basis. And what was found was that if you had a peak in air pollution on a certain day, where it would go up by, I don't know, a factor of three or four, then you would get a peak. Two days later, you would get a peak in emergency presentations of respiratory and cardiovascular emergencies at hospitals. So, obviously, even these quite low concentrations are having acute effects on people's health. And for a certain part of the population, they can be serious, really serious, life-threatening. But most people would only notice relatively minor effects. And if you think of what I'd call Zone 3, which is the sort of rest of the town, more than 100 metres or so from the fire scene, and we're talking about a fire lasting a few hours, then you're talking about fairly minor effects from breathing that smoke. If you can see sort of 50 to 100 meters through the smoke, but you can see there's some foggy smoke there, or the visibility is of that sort of order, then there shouldn't be a serious hazard to people, even most people with some health problems, but they could potentially be in a small subset if a very large number of people are exposed. And we're talking even for a prolonged exposure of, let's say, half a day. It should be fairly minor, but some... Most people would be pretty minor, if anything, but some people might be sensitive. And one of the things that concentrated my mind on this was the Buncefield fire, which was about eight miles from where I live. That, if you remember, was where a tank farm caught fire some years ago. And I heard something, I thought I heard a noise at two o'clock in the morning, it was in the winter. And I got up, and I looked out the window, I thought it was as if a large vehicle had gone paused or something. Something had happened in the night. But I couldn't see anything, so I just went back to bed. When I got up the next morning, looked out the window, I saw this enormous, huge smoke plume punching up into the sky and flowing south towards London. And I thought, wow, you know, what would happen if that plume came down to ground level? But because there was a temperature inversion, and because the plume was fairly buoyant, as it were, fortunately, the plume, and it ended up going more or less in the direction of Southampton. It didn't go over central London in the end. Hardly anybody was exposed to that huge fire, the combustion process, that huge fire, the combustion process of that huge fire. When the wind changed, there were people in Holland who started to complain of problems. So in other words, it wasn't until the plume grounded over a couple of hundred miles away that anybody really got exposed to that. But it was sufficient, even the dilution. Imagine a dilution in Holland from a fire near London. It was enough that people were aware of it and affected by it. And the only time I became aware of it, this fire burned for, I don't know, a week or two before it was extinguished, was I was at work, which is about four or five miles from where the fire is. And when they took all the energy out of the plume and put the fire out, for the first time, the smoke was mixing near ground level, and you could smell it even five or six miles away. So I know you work in this area, so the dilution and movement of these plumes is really quite an interesting thing and the sort of target concentrations people are going to be exposed to. So this is the acute side of it. I think a very interesting area is going to be medical epidemiological studies of people who are near or in the vicinity of large wildfires, which have been so much more common in recent years. And a little bit of work starting to come up on downstream health effects, asthma and stuff like that, respiratory problems. Wildfires also are quite interesting because you have a very large fire front with not such a huge energy density as it's burning. You know, when you have a fire of an oil tanker, it's immense energy density you have there. The plume is super hot. In forest fires, the plume, of course, it's hot and it can be big enough to create its own weather. But in many cases, it's much less. It's not like a plume over an oil tanker. So maybe these effects of grounding the smoke and mixing, especially if there's wind, maybe these effects may be a little more prevalent than from a very strong thermal plume over a chemical spill. Right. So absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely. And that's right. So, I would think we have now got very large cohorts of people who have been exposed for days or even weeks to these diluted plumes that are in there for many days in their area. And so, it's an opportunity to really study the effects that these have on their health compared to control groups. And I think we will start to see a lot more health problems coming out from that kind of area. So I think in that sort of situation where you're exposed maybe for several days or even weeks to these kind of smelly, dilute residues left over from large fires in the area, that we might start to see more health problems down the line. And we should be taking these very seriously. Are there any specific substances that we should be monitoring, tracking? You've mentioned the PM25, PM10. Yeah, that's right. So, obviously, the particle size is very important because it determines where something deposits in the respiratory tract. PM10 is going to be in the sort of more upper airways. And PM2.5 is small enough to get quite deep down into your lung and cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or acute obstructive pulmonary disease, that kind of thing. Also, these very small particles get into the blood and affect the blood vessels and can cause heart problems and things like that. So, PM2.5, physically, to the extent that it's just pure carbon, is of concern. But, of course, of more concern is the fact that, as we've been discussing, condensed onto those particles is going to be all sorts of pyrolysis and organic products, some of them partially oxidized, the sorts of things we've been talking about. Sorry, I always liked this comparison that the soot particles and the particulate matter acts like delivery vehicles for all the worst things that happen in the fire, all the oils. Absolutely, yes. I did an experiment on this, I think I might have mentioned it last time once, with a simple model, which was hydrogen chloride. So when I got animals to inhale hydrogen chloride gas, the mice this was, then they had strong effects on their upper respiratory tract and their nose, you know, so they got this RD50 response. But when I generated the HCL as an aerosol of aqueous hydrogen chloride acid particles, acid mist of respirable size of about 0.5 microns, monodisperse atmosphere, then I got lots of lung inflammation because the small particles carry the stuff down. And other experiments I've done with smokes, I've had lung problems with animals where there'd been smoke particles. So the smoke particles are very important, as you say, as condensing points to pick up and carry these nasty chemicals down into the lung. And once they get there, of course, if you look at the lung of a cigarette smoker, a portion of them will be removed, but a portion will stay there forever. And so those toxic effects locally to the cells in the lung can carry on. And, of course, the main site of lung cancer is the tracheal bifurcation, where the air flowing into the lung has to go two ways, split into two directions to each lung and there's a sort of deposit point where particles get deposited and that's one of the key sites so where you've got glyphogenic chemicals in the smoke which you will have from wildflower smoke or any other smokes we've been discussing then they can be deposited there but it's as I say a single insulin isn't really going to give you enough to cause problems. What's the problem? It's going to be if you're exposed to these atmospheres over a prolonged period. And that's where we're interested then in things like the dioxins and the polyaromatic hydrocarbons that are in the smoke. Would you like to talk a little bit about the carcinogens? Yes, please. I was about to ask if we have already identified some of, let's say, supercarcinogenic particles, like the stuff that is worse in the fire smoke. Produced at low content, but it's very dangerous. Well, so there's an organization called the IARC, which is an international classification scheme for carcinogens. Yes. It is individual substances and the extent to which they're carcinogenic. There's a thing called the IARC classification scheme, and they're grouped according to their activity. So something that's in group one is something that's been demonstrated as carcinogenic to humans. And then you've got group 2, and group 2 is group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. Group 2B is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Group 3 is not identifiable as carcinogenic, and group 4 is probably not carcinogenic. And this is all based on epidemiology, you know, so that's why there's some uncertainty with some of these. So what we're particularly concerned about is anything in Group 1, Group 2A, and to a lesser extent perhaps Group 2B. Now when we look at the sort of things that come off in fires, I've sort of classified these according to their composition. So one category is substances containing carbon and hydrogen with or without oxygen. So these are hydrocarbon-y type materials or aromatic materials. Some of them have got partially oxidized aldehydes and things like that. And in that group, you've got formaldehyde, which is the simplest aldehyde, HCHO, which is a known carcinogen. And that's a very common product that's always found. And it particularly... You have mentioned this appeared as soon as you've introduced the oxygen to the tube furnace. Absolutely. Yeah. And it came from burning a base polypropylene. So it's not that the substance was very... It does, but it also particularly comes from cellulosic materials. So wood, all cellulosic material produces lots of formaldehyde from cellulosic materials, so wood. Wood cellulosic material produces lots of formaldehyde and acrylene, particularly from wood. That's why wood smoke can be very irritant. So formaldehyde is in group one. Acrylene is group three, so we don't really know enough about it, but it's suspected as possible. Then you've got acetaldehydes, the many aldehydes, ethylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, and benzene, which is something you're sure you've heard of, which is a known cause. It's a really bad carcinogen. Styrene, methylstyrene, and then the polyaromatic hydrocarbons. So all these are known or suspected carcinogens, and they're all present. They're sort of products. Remember I was saying yesterday, nearly all the burning materials would produce that mix to a greater or lesser extent. Hydrocarbons would have a tendency to create particles that close rings, and I see most of ring substances in this list already are known carcinogens. Benzene, which is the simplest ring, already is a nasty one. And if you think of something like petrol, gasoline, gasoline will burn to some extent. If you just have a fire, a gasoline fire, to the extent that it's burning inefficiently, it will form benzene in the combustion products, be formed from the smaller molecules. But there's also a certain amount of benzene already in petroleum. So some of that benzene might escape, must be evaporated when the fuel heats up. So that would also apply to wood or any material that will have that mixed. Then you've got substances which have nitrogen in as well as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. Tobacco, for example, is one. Or any nitrogen-containing fuel would produce a substance called acrylonitrile. Acrylonitrile is a suspected carcinogen. Ethylcarbamate is a carcinogen. And then you've got the nitrosamines, which are carcinogens. You've probably heard of nitrosamines. Or nitroaerines. And toluene dyes are cyanates. So there's some quite awkward chemicals that could come off from those. And then you've got the halogenated materials, like PVC or anything with halogenated flame retardants in. And, of course, the benzpyrenes and things, things that we used to use, sorry, the chlorinated biphenyls that we used to use as coolants in transformers and things like that, are also now burned. But all these produce dioxins and halogenated products when they're burned. Some of them can be carcinogens. PCBs, for example, are only created by fumes. One second for halogens. Just recently, there has been a major fire of a train in the US. I think it was East Palestine, where they were carrying PVC monomer. Vinyl chloride monomer. Yeah, PVC monomer. And it would fall into these containing halogen parts, right? Yes, a vinyl chloride monomer is a carcinogen itself. And then when it burns, you have various halogenated materials produced from that. But one of the most important toxic products, I think you can get is flus gene, which is a very powerful long irritant. So there's quite a few things there. That's like a biological weapon, actually. Yeah. Not a great combustion product. Okay, so let's move to the phosphorus. You've mentioned phosphorus. Well, yeah, it's not so short a list, really, but the famous case with the phosphorus is the treatment that was used for children's nightwear to make them flame retardant, which is a suspected carcinogen. We were worried about not just the carcinogenicity, but the potential neurotoxicity of some of the organic products that can be released from phosphorus-containing materials in flowers, nitrogen phosphorus-containing. There is something that needs a lot more research. We don't know much about it. Basically, when you have phosphorus as a material, in your materials burning, most phosphorus ends up as phosphorus pentoxide and then phosphoric acid when you burn with something containing phosphorus, which is irrelevant, but it's relatively not too dangerous. But there is some evidence that a small proportion containing phosphorus, which is relatively not too dangerous. But there is some evidence that a small proportion does come off as toxic organic nitrogen phosphorus materials. So it's an area that needs more research, but it's a concern. And then we haven't finished yet, because the other thing you can get there are metals. Chromium, nickel, molybdenum, antimony, trioxide, which is used in some materials, or athleanthine lead. Some of these materials can be given off in small amounts in certain fuels, so in wood and coal and things like that. And what about if you, aluminium substructures, so for example facades, like aluminium is widely used in construction. And I often see if I'm having a very severe fire test of aluminium structure, there's nothing of it that's left, you know, after a fire, after a very big fire. So I assume it evaporated in a way. Is that dangerous in some ways? Because there's a debate about how much aluminium actually combusts during the fire, because it oxidizes, and how much it actually adds to the heat release, which is something people talk about. But oxides of aluminium are not really that toxic. So I went to a big fire once in a hotel in Egypt where they'd been, an aluminium facade had burned. And my memory from that is seeing like stalactites of mould, solidified aluminium on the ground, you know, where it had all run down and solidify on the ground. Yeah, so this is a minor it tends to be a fairly minor concern the metals, but they are there. And then in tobacco smoke you can actually get radioactive polonium because it's in the tobacco when it's grown in the soil where the tobacco's grown and what's remaining is a more concern recently from far instance are mineral fibres and obviously if you've got asbestos in your fire, the breaking up and some of those fibres can get broken up and entrained into the flume and deposited in and around the countryside or inhaled by people who are nearby. And of course, asbestos is a known carcinogen and problem. And ceramic fibres as well. Ceramic fibres, which are asbestos-like, if you like, in their composition. Because the problem with these is that if you inhale them while they are deposited in the lung, and the lung has a mechanism for cleaning itself, and the mucus that comes up out of the lung is the way that particles are deposited in the lung and cleaned out. And particles that get deep into the lung are removed by a different mechanism. So if you get little particles down as far as the alveolar region of your lung, then that's removed by little cells called macrophages, blood cells, which like a little anemia, you know, they come and engulf the particle and try and carry it away to disposals to keep your lungs clean. And to some extent that works. But when you get asbestos in there, then the macrophage can't absorb the particle because it's like a long, thin spike. And I've seen photographs of this where you end up with three or four macrophages on a fibre of asbestos looking like kebabs on a stick. And what happens then is that you've got a whole rupture in the lining of the macrophage, which means that the cellular contents leak out and the macrophage dies. And so you never really get those fibres out. They get stuck in the lung. And not only that, but the products leaked from the macrophages are highly inflammatory. So you get this constant inflammation site for years in the lung, which is why asbestos fibers are so dangerous. It's interesting they've once added that to tobacco filters in the 60s. How horrible is that when these properties were not known? No, that's right. Silica is another problem. So, I mean, one of the problems that followed the World Trade Center, which was rather different in some files, was that you had the building collapse. And because the building collapsed, you had a huge cloud of cementitious dust, if you remember seeing those videos of the time. And so people inhaled these mixtures of fibers and dust particles and all sorts of things in. And then down the line, some of the firefighters, particularly who survived the World Trade Center event, have developed all sorts of lung problems and deposits in the lungs from that one incident. So that's another concern. And how about lead? I think after Notre Dame Cathedral fire, there was a considerable amount of interest in lead poisoning around, because the historical structure has used lead as a construction and joint material, and it just evaporated in the fire. Well, if you inhale it, it's a problem. But it's more likely to be a problem by ingestion. It would be deposited all around, and then it might get involved in food, you know, or if you're growing food or something like that. Suddenly, with dioxins and things, they can contaminate vegetables and things in areas that have got contamination in. I wouldn't have thought inhalation of lead was too big a problem, but it's one of the ones I've just listed. So, in theory, yes, it could be an issue. Okay. David, we went into a loophole of this guy, and I'm having huge fun listing all these chemicals and learning about them. But the point is, fire smoke and far away from the fire, you're most likely not inhaling in a single event a significant dose of that. in a single event, a significant dose of that. Of course, it may vary within the population, and you may be at extreme risk at some point, and then probably it's not very good. But it's especially important for people like investigators, firefighters, fire researchers, who are exposed daily to those substances, which add up and increase. Yes, we should be more careful. Yes, we should be more careful. Two times we should be more careful. One is when we're actually conducting the tests. We should make sure we're not exposed to the smoke and we have reasonable respiratory protection or separation. But particularly when you go in afterwards to clean up and take samples, and fire investigators especially, or firefighters who are going, damping down or cleaning up after an event, in a dusty smoky, where they were disturbing the deposited smoke particulates and other chemicals around. And in fact you can get sick buildings as well this way. I came across cases where you bring up fire in a building, the building's then been refurbished, but not properly cleaned, professionally cleaned. And so to some extent, the smoke deposits and all the sort of pyrolisators associated with them have been covered up and are still in various ducts and places in the building. And then you can end up with a sick building that that building is going to off-grass those products at very low levels over long periods of time and some people's health is affected and the one particular case I got involved with was a school where there'd been a fire and the school was refurbished everybody went back to work at the school and then a new teacher came to work at that school and over a period of time started to get allergies and various other respiratory problems and things like that, which eventually were linked to the fact that they hadn't done a proper cleanup after the incident. And they were still off-gassing of materials which could be detected in the atmosphere or in the ductwork and things like that. So I think in terms of exposure to some of these things like dioxins, the hazards from inhalation at the sea, particularly if you take basic respiratory protection, is not a big hazard. I did some quantitative calculations on this once. But what is a big hazard potentially is getting soot and contamination on your hands and your clothes and even possibly down the line on your food. Or if firefighters go home and they have dirty clothing and then they take it off in the home and dust is spread around the home which has got all these deposits in and then you're giving you're getting long-term exposure of the skin of you yourself and maybe even your family which over a long period of time can can be hazardous and i think that's an area of a lot of research interest at the moment. So, this dermal and oral exposure, more perhaps than inhalation exposure. I will second that if someone's interested in this and haven't seen the podcast episode with Gav Horn about the unsafe fire scene. I'm going to link it into the show notes of this podcast episode. And, David, on this I would like to end this interview. It was, again, brilliant. And I have learned a lot. So thank you once again for coming to Fierstein Show to share your knowledge and experience and the most interesting histories of research you have conducted. Thank you so much. Well, thank you very much. It's been very interesting to talk to you about all this, and I hope people find it of some value. And that's it. And boy, some value we found definitely in this episode with David Purser. It's such a joy and pleasure to interview people like David, who are passionate scientists, devoted a lifetime of research into understanding fundamental things in fire in a way that perhaps no one else on the planet does. Pure joy for me and something that I've only dreamt about when I've started the podcast. It's very difficult for me to summarize. This is the final episode with David that closes a four-episode cycle of episodes with him on fire toxicity. I hope you found the whole series interesting. And for me, myself, it's perhaps the most intense course on toxicity and toxic hazards related to fires I ever had in my life. So, certainly a very useful and helpful resource for me. I've learned a lot and I hope that's the same case for you. I know there was a lot of chemistry around and that was not easy. A lot of chemicals and names and this world is huge and fascinating and complicated, but it is important. We tend to omit that. We tend to simplify it, maybe sometimes oversimplify it, but it clearly is an important part of fire science, and I hope this four-episode with David just brought this part of fire science a little closer to you. I hope you'll eventually find and use for everything that has been said in the episode. I wish you that and that would be it for now. Thank you for listening to the fire science show and guess what? See you here next Wednesday. Another episode coming your way. Cheers. Bye.
