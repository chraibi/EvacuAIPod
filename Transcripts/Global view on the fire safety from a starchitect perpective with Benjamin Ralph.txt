 Hi. So I wonder, what do you think? Who has the biggest impact over the fire safety of a newly constructed building? Is it the fire safety engineer? Well, that would be great if that was the case, but I think it rarely is. Is it other engineers? Structural, mechanical, electrical? Well, also, they are important, but maybe not the most important party in the whole thing. Who is it? In my opinion, the architect is the most powerful being in the design of a new building. And that is for two reasons. The first is while we engineers can choose materials, we can use technical systems solutions for our problems. Architects are people who have the power over the space of the building, the interconnections between the spaces, the size of the thing. With a single choice related to the compartment size or how openings are placed within the compartment, they often can make a bigger difference to the fire dynamics than we can with our active systems or passive protection. The second reason is the architects are involved at the most infant stage of the building. Have you ever been in a situation where you've came into a really horrible solution on a building and it was not possible to revert it anymore because it's just too late well the architect has the power to act at the very early stage and some of the decisions they make will have the profound meaning up to the end of the building how it's built used and then destroyed so we better have these choices being done well, right? As you can imagine, for today's episode, I have an architect. No, not really. I have a blood and bone fire safety engineer, a good friend of mine, who's entered one of the biggest architectural companies in the world, Foster & Partners. This is the architect bureau that designed the Apple headquarters or the super tall building, Warsaw Tower, that's currently being built in Warsaw and it's going to be the highest skyscraper in the European Union. My guest is the head of fire safety in this office and he will share his insight on how a global organization, a global Star Architect Bureau works and how fire safety is being organized there. on how a global organization, a global Star Architect Bureau works, and how fire safety is being organized there. He's not only a fire safety engineer now, but also a former academic and a scientist. I've met him as a brilliant smoke control engineer and someone who really knows his ways around mechanical ventilations. He's been involved in validation and verification of fire dynamics simulator. So he got the best of both worlds. I hope you really enjoyed this because it touches so many critical points on the connection between us, the fire engineers and architects, which is critical to build fire safe buildings. So, yeah, ladies and gentlemen, everybody. Welcome to Firesense Show. I'm today here with Benjamin Ralf. Hey, Ben. Great to have you here. Hey, Gorzak. How's it going? How are you? Thanks for having me. I'm good. I'm good. Thanks for taking the invite. I'm really happy to have you here. Hey, Wojciech, how's it going? How are you? Thanks for having me. I'm good, I'm good. Thanks for taking the invite. I'm really happy to have you here. Ben has a really cool career path. I've met you, Ben, when you were a little younger friendly chap talking about verification and validation of FDS. Not so long ago, and then I've learned you've left academia for a career at the Star Architect Bureau, Foster Plus Partners. Then I've learned you became the head of fire safety there. Wow, congratulations, man. That's so cool. Tell me, how is it to make this step from academia into world's best architect company? What made you take this move? Yeah, sure thing. So I, slightly unusually, my move into academia was already, you could call it delayed maybe by six years because I, after I finished my undergrad, I went to work as a fire engineer in fire engineering organizations. And then that's when I said to myself, okay, let's go back to school. And maybe there's another world out there. And maybe there's another route to take, which is when I did my PhD at University of Edinburgh. And at the end of that, or as I was nearing the end, I saw this fork in the road, really, between on the left hand side, you'd have, okay, let's stay in academia, let's stay in research and let's make this is my path and then on the right hand side is let's take what i've learned and go back to um being a fire engineer in uh you know an engineering world uh and then by chance really it turns out that there was this third path that i hadn't really seen before and i brushed away some leaves and i you know moved into the bushes a bit and there was this third path which was to join Foster and Partners at that time the position was a senior fire engineer and I've always been one of my primary drivers really is always positive impact you know trying to in my very very small way make as cheesy but make the world a better place by leveraging my combination of skills and knowledge and, you know, passion. And I thought, wow, you know what, maybe this is where I can have the most positive impact on what you could call, you know, quote unquote, the real world. So people in buildings, in cities, in the built environment. And fast forward three years, you know, it's been a bit of a challenging, very exciting roller coaster of three years. And now I'm the head of fire safety and I've got a, you know, a small team, but it's growing and the future is looking really exciting, really bright. That's so amazing, man. When I met you, I was absolutely sure you are deemed to succeed. The charm was one thing, but the choice of shirts was another one. This combination must have worked, and it seems it did. That's it. Yeah, I think that's why I got the shirt. It's a fancy shirt. That's cool, man. It's a fancy shirt. That's cool, man. And this is kind of amazing because you said you want to alter the world or make it change, and now you have this ability to work on some of the most sophisticated engineering projects. And we're not talking about projects only in the UK, where let's say the overall engineering level is pretty good. And whatever the inquiry says, I still think it's probably in the upper level of the world. But you really work globally and you have a chance to meet engineers, architects, authorities worldwide. This, like, you know, global village thing and the fire safety worldwide is something that always fascinated me. thing and the fire safety worldwide is something that always fascinated me because how does a fire safety differ from poland to uk from uk to kuwait from kuwait to south africa or other countries so it's still the same the gravity constant is the same the heat release rate per unit area is is pretty much similar but yet it's's like everyone has a different view on fire. What's your take on that? Do you see that now as you touch it? So it's interesting because people will often say in meetings and workshops, a little bit flippantly, well, fire is everywhere all over the world. And you could go a step further than that and you could say fire science is the same yeah like you say the um you know the universal constant is the same and heat release rate per unit areas give or take the same okay furnishings might be a little bit different or whatever it is yes fire science is the same but i would say that as soon as you start to talk about safety and you start to talk about definitely design, but safety and risk and you start to get into a world of acceptability and reasonability and those things change. You know, acceptance of risk changes internationally and culture changes internationally. So I'd say that fire science is constant wherever you are but fire safety does change combine with that very differing um approaches with respect to the legal side of fire so you know compliance and countries all over the world have taken a whole bunch of different ways um some extraordinarily prescriptive based uh tick the box you know implicit safety type um building design and then some on the other side um with uh i mean not necessarily explicit safety but before what we like yeah. That's it, yeah. And sort of everywhere in between, really. That's the thing that changes. Cultural norms change. There's one thing you realize very quickly as well when you start to work, you know, dip your toe all over the world, is that there are things that some countries, and by that I mean broadly codes, really, some countries really care about. And the level of implicit or explicit safety that's thrown at certain things is much, much higher in comparison to other parts of the world. So a typical example might be here in the UK, we now have for the first time in a very long time, we now have for the first time in a very long time prescriptive at law level at legislation level to do with external walls and of course that you know that's level that came about because of a terrible tragedy and that's something that's very very local very very specific whereas you look at other parts of the world um and they really care about compartmentation in car parks for example because there was a large fire where sadly a whole bunch of people lost their life in a car park fire so you know that the idea around design by disaster um has a geographical variability which is interesting and then i mean, really one of the key, key challenges of my current role is we're an international organization designing, constructing, building all over the world. You know, what's the best solution? Because there's international variation. And if there's something that's missed for whatever reason, local jurisdiction, we're in a position to see that. We've got that international oversight to ask those questions of, hold on a minute, why in this country can we design a building made of X, Y, Z? You know, those sorts of pretty challenging questions, actually. It's a huge challenge for you and your team because you have this knowledge and experience coming from the UK context now working worldwide and you come to a country like Poland and for example in Poland we have the culture of pressurization systems that are used everywhere above 30 meters and in fact pressurization systems in Poland are very very high advanced solutions and not something that you would see, for example, in the UK market. And I know that from experience. And now you are faced with this. You probably could be biased against them because I know in UK you guys are not a big fan of that. In Poland, we have solutions that work. But coming with your experience, you see our solution and your first thought might be it does not work. But coming with your experience, you see our solution and your first thought might be it does not work. So you could argue against our solution that works. But it goes obviously the other way. You could go to a country and see a horrible solution that's built within the law and you know that it will not work because you've been there, you've done that, and you somehow have to get out of that. And then again, you're coming to a different country, different culture, you have to be respectful for the right of that country, the jurisdiction to set their own rules and expectations and not look from like above them that you know better. Yeah, you start to get into social norms. I find it extremely annoying when there's an architect or someone coming from abroad and will teach me how to do fire engineering. That's not how we do it, by the way. I say that you do, but sometimes you probably have to do, and how to do it in a respectful manner and respecting these cultural differences that naturally are between the codes. You said the fire science is the same, and I completely agree. The universal constants will be the same. The expectations may be different, and the expected safety may be different. However, in most cases, expected safety would not be explicitly measured. Like, what is the safety you want? Probably no one can answer the question, what's the risk level that's tolerable? No, just follow. We've got a set of rules over here. Follow these rules, and that's our safety. So you come to a country like here, and what's your take? How do you deal with this? Because I think it must be a horrible challenge to do that yeah it's tough it is and i'd say it's one of the key challenges because there's so many sometimes competing objectives there's professional objectives there's organizational objectives both my organization and uh you know the clients and the other stakeholders. Take a hypothetical example. You go to a country, and in that country, for whatever reason, whether it's a lack of accidents or whether it's just how buildings are operated in that country, ductwork that is used for fire mode exhaust isn't provided with any additional protection at all you know they just use just normal steel duct work right and it can go anywhere and that's how they do it and they've done it for decades and nothing's ever gone wrong and it's fine and it's you know and like you say it's these these prescriptive rules that embedded in there somewhere is this implicit safety that that everybody's signed up to. You may have evidence to the contrary, or you may realize that that fundamentally doesn't line up with international consensus. And then you get into quite a difficult conversation because, unsurprisingly, there's cost attached to it, right? It's not cheap. So you want them to do something they have never done? It's an additional cost? They've never done it. And the obvious question is, why do we have to do it? Why? We didn't do it last time. Why do we have to do it now? Do you know how much that's going to cost? It's going to cost this many million pounds. And that's where you need to get the fire science and get the evidence in a very i think respect you use the word respect there in a very respectful way and a very clear way and it's um it's influence really it stops becoming um engineering and it becomes influence and are you capable of accepting the risk that the choice may not be taken and you will have to live with with the risk because your client is willing to do that. Yeah, I mean, ultimately and thankfully, it never generally comes down to this, what you can think of as sort of a worst, worst case scenario. This means you're good. Yeah. It's those shirts, isn't it? The colorful shirts. But the sort of worst case, bottom of the bucket environment is if I write a letter, you know, and say, this is our recommendation, this is the basis of the recommendation. And ultimately, it's up to the person who's paying the bill. It's up to them, really. It's like you going to a, I don't know, a home appliance store, and then you've got a choice of three different washing machines, and the salesman saying to you, this one's the best, it's the most expensive, this one's fine in its middle, this one is terrible, and I'm telling you, in a year, it's going to explode, but it's cheap, and I can buy that cheap one. And there's not much you can do as that salesman, right, other than just say, honestly, I really don't think you should buy this cheap one. And if I want to buy the cheap one, I'll buy the cheap one. But what you do realize, though, is that, and to take that analogy a little bit further then with this dishwasher, if the salesperson says to you, you know what, I really, you could buy the cheap one, but long term, you want to buy the medium or the expensive one. And here are the benefits. Oftentimes, you'll buy that more expensive washing machine and you'll be thankful for it. And you say, well, thanks very much. You know, you're the expert. You're the salesperson. You told me the facts and figures to enable me to make an informed decision. And then the beauty of it is you go away and you say you bought the middle priced or the most expensive washing machine. You go away when you want to buy a microwave. You remember that salesperson. You say, well, yeah, they sort of told it to me straight, didn't they, actually? And you know what? This washing machine is working still. You go back to that same salesperson, you buy a microwave from them as well. You know, I was contemplating how we would approach this if we were really able to convince someone. In fact, it really works like that you mentioned. Usually, actually, if your argumentation is strong, if you can provide the proof, if you can use the fire science behind your reasoning, it actually ends up with a good choice because people want safety. No one wants to design a building that's going to end up on the first page of a newsletter saying that 70 people died in it. It's obviously more horrible for people who die but also challenging for architects and others who design the building, for example. You brought up this salesperson parallel. In my personal opinion, we're also living in a world where safety is a product and the product is sold. And this is my experience. I find many people, many companies, try to sell you products that unnecessarily bring you safety to sell you products that unnecessarily bring you safety and products that are marketed you know based on the most recent trends like i've told you in the green room the electric vehicles and batteries are now the trend yeah everything is now being sold because it improves your chances against this horrible electric vehicle fires that and and you, it's very difficult as a fire scientist to compete against this, let's say, shady marketing, because there's just more marketers than there are fire scientists, and fire scientists that would like to take a voice, an active voice in their communities. And I find it really challenging, you know, because there is this flood of misinformation, You know, because there is this flood of misinformation, fake science or abuse science, abuse science in a way that it it's used to emphasize one certain characteristic of a product to make it look better above its competition. Yeah. And then you come into the place with the real science. Then you come into the place with the real science. You define new way to take the fan curve or you find things that are related to pressures in buildings. And it's really hard to get people to listen to you. Yeah, well, it's tough. Intellectually, it's very deep stuff, isn't it? Yeah. I think if you take an architect as an example, and they describe themselves oftentimes as a jack of all trades, but a king of none. So, you know, they know a little about a lot. And also, one thing you realize is very, very quickly that as this lead designer, as the sort of the fulcrum of the design process, they have to balance so many objectives. And they have to balance all these plates, And they have to balance all these plates. They're holding up all these different plates. And if someone can come in and say, don't worry about that plate anymore, just forget about it. Here's a bit of snake oil and just forget about it. It's really, it sounds great. And that's where I think what you're describing there with these unscrupulous, heavily marketed and twisted sales type actors. It sounds too good to be true. It is. But when you're balancing so many objectives and someone can take one of those objectives away and just say, hey, don't worry about it. It's okay. You're pretty inclined to do it. My absolute favorite of recent times is the magical paint. I don't know if you've met the magical paint yet. I've met quite a lot of magical paints. Yeah, I don't know if it's like... Ours is like super magical. One layer of paint gives you heat insulation like 20 centimeters of mineral wool or something. I'm like, heat transfer is not working like that. It'm like, no, heat transfers not work like that. It's like, it just does not. There's some magical paints which stop wood burning. That's always... That's another kind of magical paint. Well, maybe I should... I'm kind of good in these things. Maybe I should start a magical paint business. Maybe it's better than fires. It could be three in one, couldn't it? Let's go deeper on the role of the architects because um i i love architecture i i am really passionate about uh beautiful buildings and living in warsaw exposes me to a lot of great architecture every day actually actually one of my favorite buildings in Warsaw is Metropolitan. It's a 20-year-old building designed by Norman Foster. 2,000 years ago, Vitruvius in The Architecture wrote the three main roles for the architecture is to provide functionality, durability, and beauty. The first two go into, let's say, the craft and the beauty goes into the architect's mind. And I think all three elements, 2,000 years later, are still the key ones in architecture. And I truly find the role of the architect in designing a modern building, no matter if it is the next biggest building in Europe or it's just another residential area, it's critical to give it this unique flavor because people thrive for this beauty. how they shape the space, the material choices they take. You know, sometimes this particular minuscule details on the roof that can change everything when you think of it from a smoke control perspective. Architects have this fundamental role in shaping the fire safety of the future building, probably even bigger than they would ever think they have. you're building, probably even bigger than they would ever think they have. And I wonder what's your take, because you are building a fire safety team for a global organization that is essentially a global, like, architect bureau that designs probably hundreds, if not thousands, buildings a year. Yeah. Maybe less. Maybe not thousands, but hundreds of beautiful buildings a year. And how would you approach architecture to explain this unique role they have? Because I think many of the architects are actually unaware of the power they have in their pen when they're drawing the outline of the building and how a single line can make or break the fire safety of it more than even the installation of sprinklers or dropping 100 million quid on passive fire protection woods, right? So how to reach them with this message? So one thing to touch on at the beginning of your question your question there was talking about um the architect's role in defining the fire safety design and you know initializing it and drawing lines and choosing materials and my old the moment that that really clicked for me it was i think it was the second week that i was at foster and partners and um i had found myself in pretty familiar situations like workshops and meetings. And it felt very familiar from my experience as a fire engineer. And then I was in one particular workshop about two weeks in, and there was drawings pinned up on the wall, drawings strewn over the table. And we were looking at, it was sort of concept design and how big the building was and how it was cut up and all this sort of stuff, general layout. And then I pointed at a wall, and I was trying to work, in my head I was building up a means of egress strategy. And I pointed at a wall and I said, so what's this wall, what's it made of? And the room just went silent, and everybody looked at me. of and the room just went silent and everybody looked at me and it was about two or three seconds then someone says that wall is made of whatever we want it to be made of and it was one of those moments you know boom it just clicked and i was so so familiar with as the role of a fire engineer and you know everybody always grumbles that we're involved much too late in the project and things are pretty much quite literally sometimes set in stone and you say what's this made of that's made of this okay you know what am i working with here uh what's this made of how how tall is it how small is it what size is it um and it was that moment of right wow okay that's not even here yet you know that's not even defined yet. You know, that's not even defined yet. That's brilliant. I think you're definitely right in that a lot of architects, and there are some different things going on. Architectural training looks very different internationally as well. And Boston Partners, we have architects from all over the world. So you have people that have had a very different academic upbringing, actually. So they think about different things and they prioritize different things. So that's definitely in the mix. And you mentioned there that your suspicion is that maybe some architects don't recognize their role or they don't fully appreciate how fundamental their role is to fire safety. And I think that sometimes is the case. And there's stairs is a good example, right? I mean, yeah, absolutely. There's, they're so ingrained in buildings that you, people don't, and this isn't just architects, you don't really pay any attention to them. You know, well, of course, there's going to be a stair over here and a stair over there. Just drop one in the middle. Just drop one in the middle and it's done, right? Drag it around, grab it, but that's fundamental fire safety design. And then you start to realize that so much of a building is driven by fire safety and you forget it. I think everybody forgets it and architects forget it as well. So there is that constant reminder of, you know, everything that's happened here has a really strong impact upon the fire safety design of this, whatever it is, building or city. I had this project recently. We were designing an underground tramway station. And the main architectural feature of that station was a giant skylight above one of the staircases. And I was like, you know what? This skylight does not work with the smoke control system. After the CFD, we've done it. There's smoke penetrating it. It's creating troubles. And the architect was kind of, you know, protective. I cannot remove it. It needs to be there. It's the distinguished feature of the building. It needs to remain. And I was like, yeah, I completely understand that it's the distinguishing architectural feature of this building. I'm not trying to influence your design in a way that it will not look like you've envisioned it. I want to do simple alterations in this design to make it safe. And if we change the hole by a half meter, we'll not change the look of it, but it will completely turn around the safety in this particular case. And the architect was very relieved because she has probably not worked with this approach before, probably before she was forced to do some choice against her will to fit within this, you know, framework of safety. And we say the fire safety is often the driving force for many decisions. And in many cases, it's driving much more things in the building you would normally expect. The fire safety requirements and the compartmentations, the size of your walls, local requirements for your facade. Implementations, the size of your walls, local requirements for your facade. These are the things that will absolutely put a constraint on what you can design on the building. But on the other hand, there are things that are usually not constrained in which the architect is the most powerful person ever. And for me, this is, for example, the height of the car park. We've done hundreds, if not thousands of CFD simulations for car parks. And what we've learned, there is no other thing that would matter as much as the height of the car park. By changing the car park from like 2.7 meters to three meters, you improve the safety twice. Like it's double safe anyway so there's this huge power and it's not the the hvc designer that can increase the height of the car park it's not uh you know it's not the fire alarm system installer that can alter it it's only the architect and probably as you mentioned in this first stage before we are, you know, in the project. This is the moment where the architect can make a decision. Okay, these levels must be at least this tall, provide this additional benefit. And this is, you know, the knowledge that I would really like to get through to architects. Because at this early stage of the project, they are the most powerful beings. And truly, their decisions are making or breaking the safety of the building. Yeah, absolutely. And tie back to one of your first questions about how, you know, what drew me to this role and how I found myself in this role is I've always been very interested in the crossover or the Venn diagram, the bit in the middle between different groups of people. So whether it's scientists and engineers or whether it's architects and engineers or whether it's academia and industry or whatever it is. And that's one of the things I try to cultivate and champion in my current role is that confluence of different types of people that have completely different ways of looking at things. And if you put those people together, it's sometimes pretty painful because you don't even start talking in the same language sometimes. The dictionary is completely different. But once you get past some of those barriers, then the solution is always much better and much more balanced. And, you know, the beauty comes into it and the functionality comes into it. And that's one of the sort of cornerstones of fostering partners is the integration of architecture and engineering. And that's why we have a whole bunch of structural engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, sustainability engineers, all working together. Sustainability engineers, nice. Yeah, yeah. They're all under this integrated design model. Because if there's one thing that you learn very quickly about architecture is that iteration is like the lifeblood of architecture is. Okay, here's a solution solution now give me 10 more and then thank you very much for the 10 more i like the first one the fifth one and the ninth one now give me 10 more of each of them and that rapid prototyping that rapid iteration i think is something that interestingly um engineers we're pretty used to it um but we're also very used to if it works it works you know i'm done now how do you place the fire safety within the rapid prototyping is it like omitted is it through best practices or you put constraints yeah on on the design what's your take and this this was an eye-opener for me actually in that um when i first started I remember talking to some of my colleagues in fire engineering you know practitioners and they were saying to me oh my goodness this is going to be fantastic because it's going to be throw out the rule book you know international building code throw that out approved document b throw that out nfba 5000 throw it out I bet that it's all performance based and it's all ground up and it's all first principle stuff. And I thought, oh, yeah, maybe it will be. What I did realize is within that context of extremely rapid iteration, you haven't got time to go away and run 100 CFT models for 100 iterations when those iterations have to happen in a matter of hours, actually. What happens if we do this? You haven't got time to say, okay, give me two weeks and I'll come back. So you start to fall back on rules of thumb. You start to fall back on codes as well, prescriptive rules, prescriptive, definitely guidance and guidelines and best practice and things like that. Because things move so quickly and the demand for thumbs up, thumbs down is so rapid. The rules are good at that. I mean, the rules work for 100 years. Yeah. There must be something good about them, right? Something to them. And they're very clean and clear. And again, to go back to what I said about balancing all these objectives, as much as we as fire engineers, fire scientists, fire safety professionals and practitioners hate to admit it. Fire is just one objective, actually. We think it's the objective, but there's many, many other objectives. When the overall design is balancing so many objectives, that quick yes, no, thumbs up, thumbs down. And it doesn't need to be by no means by saying that there's no place for going away and thinking about it. But that can come later, really. As you bring that up, I see the future. And that's in an episode we've seen in the one who mentioned the AI. Yeah, absolutely. This is where this would really shine to have this enormous database of solutions and, you know, have an artificial mind to rate them based on what they've seen in the past. And that sounds brilliant. Yeah. I understand now in your positions you would be the one with the golden thumb putting it up or down. And I agree it's unsustainable to CFD every iteration. If you say you would go through 100 projects of a single building to find the one that matches your client's expectations, your architect's vision and engineer's ability to build it, which is probably one hell to balance out, which is probably one hell to balance out, it would be difficult to really engineer every of these solutions just to find that some of them work, some of them don't, some are better, but they don't meet the other requirements. So here this mix of best practice and constraints would be a good thing. And I agree. I mean, ultimately, this prescriptive approach to the building process has more or less led to safe buildings and i mean it's difficult to quantify the safety as i said at the start this is a this is something that really fascinates me how how we determine that the building is is now safe or is not safe yeah sure, sure thing. So I'd tie that in to something that you said near the beginning as well, which was about AI and automating some of these processes. So parametric modeling is something that I find super interesting and there's a lot of value there. It's an interesting, from an outsider's point of view, yes, I work for an architectural practice primarily, but I'm still an engineer. I'm not an architect. And looking at architecture, I can see it as a bit of a schism in architecture, the use of AI and not the use of AI and the use of parametric modeling and not. And on one hand, people say, well, you're letting the computer design the building for you and whatever the building looks like, you haven't created it. But then on the other hand, some designers say, it's just a tool. You know, we've got drawing boards back in the old days, then we started using AutoCAD, and now we have this thing called parametric modeling. And, you know, we're the ones setting up the model. We're the ones writing the algorithms to define the shapes for example that come out so it's an interest it's a bit of a divergence within um and it's funny to see it from an outside perspective you know there's divergence within architecture uh but the one of the cool things with parametric modeling is that you can set up a whole bunch of parameters and then optimize them again you know and then optimize the overall solution. So, for example, we're working on a project where we really wanted the building to the west, had fantastic views, fantastic views of a bay. And we also wanted to maximize daylight at a certain time of day when the daylight wasn't too hot. But we wanted to minimize it when it was burning hot. We also wanted to optimize the, well, and then I came in saying, let's optimize travel distance as well. You know, let's put that in as a parameter, distance away from your nearest exit. And then I think embodied carbon was in there in some way, maybe size of primary elements or something like that. And it was all set up. And then, you know, to simplify a little bit, you press the button. It trials through all these iterations. And it looks a little bit like a Rubik's Cube. And you can see the building shaking and moving and coming up with all these different solutions. And it's saying, well, this one's fantastic because your average travel distance is 10 meters, but no one can see that beautiful view of the river this one's amazing because everyone can see the river but the travel distance is uh you know 100 meters or whatever it might be and then you start to pick out these um these optimized solutions or these um yeah these optimized solutions And then a human can pick them up and jig them around a little bit. So is that like to find the balance that would work, like what you would sacrifice for another? Is your choice not the computer? It's not taking away this mind. I think this is how Vitruvius got it, that the beauty is the function of mind while functionality and durability is a craft. It's pretty on the point because here it's using a tool. It's basically giving yourself superhuman powers. Not taking your ability to shape the space. Yeah. And that is fundamental. For the end, because you have a smoke control background, and I have a smoke control background, so we're two, in a way, smoke control engineers. I was wondering how, because this is a a part where i see huge huge differences in the world like i've mentioned in the episode in poland we would use pressurization systems in the uk you may not like them in poland we use jet fan systems in many parts of the world they do not believe they work. In some countries, you would design HEO straight following NFPA 204 or something. In others, you would do CFD for them. So it seems very challenging to manage this diversity as someone who has background in smoke control. Yeah, yeah. And I'll tell you now, it doesn't always work. It's not all rosy stories, and I'll admit that straight up. And there are, I can think of one example where in a country, in a jurisdiction, we've got an atrium we want it to be beautiful we want it to be open we want it to be flowing we want it to be um you know visibility is high it's a key it's the heart of the building this atrium okay fantastic cool fast forward a year or so it's it's a fully enclosed space and you know there's walls and there's fire resistant glazing and if you're lucky there's shutters and that is tough it's tough from a um from a professional point of view it's sort of tough you know because you've got a pedigree of designing these spaces and you know they work and you know that they're justifiable and you know that um you know it because you've done it and i guess you'd feel the same with your pressurization systems you know they you know that they're justifiable and you know it because you've done it. And I guess you'd feel the same with your pressurization systems. You know they work. You've done, like you say, you've done hundreds and hundreds of them. And if someone just says to you, no, you can't do that. We don't believe they work. We don't believe they work. That's the worst thing. We can't do it. You can't do it. Oh, can't do it oh but what about this no no no so sometimes there are brick walls and they literally are brick walls sometimes sometimes there are brick walls and there's nothing you can do you can push on them and you can try and you know sneak around the back and go from the left and all that sort of thing but unfortunately there are brick walls and then it becomes okay how can we make this brick wall beautiful i faced this challenge when I was doing my PhD because it was in a way related to the role of architecture in smoke control. You know, I was doing malls and connection between a shop and a mall and shaping the dimensions of the opening between the shop to the mall. And with the assumption that the mall is used to exhaust the smoke that's being produced by the fire between the shop to the, to the mall. And with the assumption that the mall is used to exhaust the smoke that, that's being produced by the fire in the, in, in the shop. Yeah. And if you take a look at this analytical models that, that are used every day to design these things, you quickly realized that the smaller opening you make in the room, the less smoke enters the, let's say the mall. And then the, the mole, and then the smaller the system you have to do within the mole. And that's what you would get from basic relations that trace back to the times of Howard Morgan and Margaret Lowe. And now when I did multi-parametric analysis in that, and I went really deep into that, I've actually found that it works up to a point when you make the opening big enough to let all the smoke escape. And if you make the opening bigger, it will not double or triple the amount of smoke because the smoke is produced by the fire, not by the opening. And when you realize that, it truly makes sense because it's like the amount of energy being generated in the compartment, the amount of smoke being produced, it's constrained by the fire, not the architecture itself. So there is an upper limit to this boundary. So if you opened your entrance, if it was eight meters wide or 16 or 20 or 50 meters wide, it did not make any difference in terms of the amount of smoke produced. And on the contrary, the bigger the opening, the easier the smoke had to escape. So the better ventilation of the compartment there was. So in the end, the safer it was, you know, because it was easier to remove the smoke from it. The smoke layer was higher. So you've endangered your occupants less and less, the bigger the opening was. your occupants less and less, the bigger the opening was. So in the end, my findings were like completely against the rules that are based on this simple analytical solutions. You would optimize for this smallest size of the opening to limit the amount of smoke. That's the classical approach. And I said, you should optimize for safety. So make the biggest opening you can afford. But I had a really tough time, you should optimize for safety, so make the biggest opening you can afford. But I had a really tough time, you know, reaching people in positions of power with the message. And unfortunately, most of the buildings in Poland are still built to the old books, you know, because they say the opening shall be small, though you make it small. Do you face the similar challenges now working with architects, like breaking these myths or these schemes that are used because it's always been like that? Yeah, once you realize that you're working with humans who have experience, who have lived a life and have schemes and schemers within their brain. You know, this is the way we've done it. This is the way we've always done it. Also, there's ownership there as well. It's like, I mean, from our academic world, if you've thought up an idea and you think, wow, this is a fantastic idea, and maybe you've got paper forming in your brain, and you think, okay, I'm just going to keep on cracking until I output this article. If someone says, no, it doesn't work for this reason. No, it doesn't work for this reason. No, it doesn't work for this reason. You just keep on going because you've cultivated ownership and inertia, you know, personal inertia. There's definitely that that happens. And of course, it leads to frustrations. Definitely, there are meetings, big roundtable table meeting very varied stakeholders and it reaches a bit of a stalemate of that's just the way it happens this is how it is that's just the way it is and it'll be and everybody in the room recognizes that um and this is i mean we we started off espousing the benefits of prescriptive rules and prescriptive codes and this is this is one of the darker sides i mean darkest bit of codes. And this is one of the darker sides. I mean, darker is a bit of an overplay. This is one of the negatives of prescriptive codes is that they're good for the cases that they fit. But when they don't, you're trying to push a circle through a square and unsurprisingly, you know, bits get chopped off. It just doesn't make any sense. And you arrive in these bizarre twilight zone discussions of um thou must have escape windows placed every 10 meters on the um you know the side of the facade that's adjacent to the fire brigade um setup area yeah but this is but it's 200 meters high why why do we need them oh because and why there are sprinklers on it yeah and why is that why is there sprinklers oh because it says it in the rule book no i get that but why well because they use it maybe they'll they'll escape out of it what 200 meters yeah yeah because the fire brigade need that and then you get to this that's just the way it is that's just the way it is that's just the way it is and then um you know it's picking battles as well really you know you just say okay fine but here i would like to say you said the power of ownership and i think the investor is a very important stakeholder in the whole process and i hope there are people in position of power listening to the podcast and i would like to bring a very good example, a very positive example, in my opinion, which is the IKEA chain. I've worked with them on some projects, and I've learned that they have this IKEA code of fire practice, which is their universal code of the fire expectations, like a rule book, how to design a warehouse, how to design a logistics center, how to design a retail shop. And these rules lead you to fairly safe solutions. And also what I've learned is that when their expectations exceed the local requirements, because it's also a global company, they would go with the exceeded ones. They would rather stick to their own requirements and add extra money to the project to fulfill their own internal ones. And if the local ones would exceed their own requirements, it's not that they're going to battle that. We have shops in 100 countries. We always do it like that. So we're going to do it like here, like that in here as well. Now they will just, okay, usually it ends up like that they agree to the solution, unless the law is really ridiculous, which sometimes is the case. In that case, they battle. But I think, you know, this, if you're in a position of power in a large global company that can create these rule books, these guidances, these best practices, it's worth doing that. And if you're not in such a position of power, it's maybe worth it to get involved with architects, with organizations that have architects in your surrounding. I don't know, maybe with the Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, with organizations that shape how architects think to, you know, promote these best practices. Because as I've mentioned before, we are far less in people than the snake oil manufacturers and sellers. And this knowledge needs to be, these best practices need to be spread around and it's dumb to wait until they're implemented in the law. Because law is very inert and often misguided by the same marketers that we would probably like to avoid, right? Yeah, I mean, it doesn't, when it comes to decisions and leadership, if you follow that up, up, up, you end up with the person with the wallet, basically. And they have, I completely agree with what you said there, they have so much influence and power, the client, you know capital will see interestingly or what's really tough there is that if we think about the journey that we're going through here in the uk the competency journey yeah what is competency how do you measure it and um what are the sub-competencies and who needs to be competent how do you measure it and how do you uh test for it and all those sorts of things it's relatively easy easy. I mean, okay, it's tough, but it's doable to do that for professionals, for example, through the Professional Engineering Institutes or through, you know, RBA. For chartered engineers, for sure. Chartered engineers, here's the rules, do this, you need to meet these. Pass this exam. Pass these exams. How do you do that for this elusive thing called the client? Because they're anybody. There's no such thing as a chartered client. License to build. Yeah, that's it. A license to have money. I mean, it doesn't exist, right? And to go back to your IKEA example, I think that those are the, you know, the dream clients where they get it and they get that there's benefit in paying extra money or there's benefit at least having the conversation and considered judgment. Yeah, man, I wish you only such clients in your future, and I wish to all the podcast listeners to be able to work with this type of client. It is really rewarding. And I know that every day is a little bit different, and there are challenges, and it's tough. It's a tough world. And as you've mentioned many times, there are so many optimization strategies, optimization goals. And fire safety, someone is the seventh, the eighth one on the line. So it may be difficult to get. But that's our job. I wish it was a little easier. It's tough. But, yeah, then again, it's very satisfying, you know, to know that. And for me, you know, the satisfaction really comes when I could have, when I did save the architect's vision and turned it into a fire safe vision. It truly is rewarding for me. Thank you so much for this insight on how the global architectural organization would work with fire safety. This was really fun. I wish everyone could work with offices like yours. After this hour of talk, we're back to our offices dealing with our MDA problems. I hope at least some good thoughts, plenty of good thoughts were shared in here. So, Ben, thanks a lot for joining the Fireside Show. Absolutely. Thanks for having me. And good luck in building your FIRE team. I'm sure we'll hear a lot about it in the future. Good luck. Hopefully all good things. All good things, hopefully. Yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you. And that's it. I hope you enjoyed that. I still can't believe we actually praised the prescriptive codes, but from the perspective presented by Ben, it does make sense that having this prescriptive way speeds up the process. And maybe not. They're not as horrible as I thought. From today's episode, the important thing for me was to figure out that rapid iteration thing in architecture. And that's really something to think about. Today, the buildings are not just a simple set of drawings that's once placed on a computer and then done forever. No, the project is a living thing that evolves, changes. And the fire safety has to change with it and adapt to the new requirements, new objectives, new goals of the building. It often happens that the buildings will change their occupation during the design process, or maybe they will grow, they will shrink, they will change. And fire safety has to adapt with that. And this is something really important to consider, that we have to design the buildings in the ways that allow for these adaptations, this change. And you also have to be open for the fact that the change will happen. You cannot block things or make fire safety design that will prevent any change in it, because you're working against the building then. And that's not our point. Our point is to promote architecture and make it safe. So, yeah, for me, that's the take of today's episode. It was a huge pleasure to talk with Benjamin, and it was very reassuring to see that the chief of fire safety at one of the best world's architect bureaus is facing the same down-to-earth problems like we do every day. So, yeah, I really hope you liked this episode. If you did, please share it with your friends, with your colleagues, with somebody. I'm on a mission to have this reach as many 5 Safety Engineers and other stakeholders as possible. Please help me do that. And yeah, see you next Wednesday as usual. Thanks. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
