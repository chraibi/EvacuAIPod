 Today we have quite a tough episode, but it's really worth it because we're going to talk a lot about chemistry. If our scientists do not like chemistry, well, I actually do like chemistry. That was one of my favorite things to do in high school times and stuff. But I know many, many engineers are not the biggest fans of chemistry. And in fact, our models are very, very good at removing chemistry from the stuff we're doing every day. But today, chemistry is what we're going to focus on, not just chemistry. It's going to be chemistry and a lot of ulogies, physiology, pathology, psychology, many things that relate to how humans relate to the harm of smoke and toxic products in fires. And for that, I have invited, I think, the best person in the world to speak on, Professor David Purser, who is an absolute legend in this field. I think he has like a hundred page long chapter in SFP handbook just on this topic. And that's like the very brief summary of his competencies to talk about toxicity and toxicology and the toxic hazards of fires. So it was a huge enjoyment to interview Professor Perser. And also it's a good occasion to do this interview. As you may know, there is a big conference happening this year. I IFSS Symposium on Fire Safety Science, the 14th one. IFSS Symposia were always important parts for the scientific fire community. And if you listen to the episode with Gene Quintero, you know how IFSS came up to life and what role did it play and for me I call it Fire Safety Olympics and for me there's no better conference to be at and during these conferences there is the delivery of invited Howard Emmons plenary lecture and to some this is considered maybe the highest honor a fire scientist can get and guess what? This year's recipient This is considered maybe the highest honor a fire scientist can get. And guess what? This year's recipient or deliverer of the Howard Emmons Planner Lecture is exactly Professor David Bursley. So, indeed, this was a huge privilege to talk with David. We've spent a long time talking, and actually I had to very brutally cut the interview into two parts. One is airing today and the next one is gonna on the next week. Anyway, I'm spoiling it and I really want you to listen on Toxicology from David. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host. The podcasting journey is not an easy one and there were better and worse times, a lot of work behind the scenes and sometimes some difficult decisions. But today, looking back, I'm so happy I've continued this pathway because it led me to a place where I can talk about toxicity with David Purser. It's simply amazing. And I can really tell you, I'm super excited to see where the podcast got me. And of course, a huge difference in how this works was brought when OFR Consultants partnered with me.

And now, back to the hyped episode with David Purser. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Fireside Show. I'm today with Professor David Purser. Hello, David. So happy to have you in the podcast. Hi there. I'm so excited. We had a small chat before the show, and I already know where this is going, and this is going to be great. Well, thank you for inviting me to do this and I'm looking forward to where we get to. David, I would love to start first congratulating you because you've been chosen as the recipient of the Howard Emmons Invited Plenary Lecture in Tsukuba in IFSS 2023. That's a whole fame honor. Congratulations. It's a big honor, isn't it? Yeah, and what a name on the award. Wow. Emmons, probably one of the biggest fire scientists of all times. And he also was doing a lot in the space of what we're going to cover today, which is hazards to people in fire and toxicology. My friend Guillaume Moraine has told me that Emmons identified toxicity and toxicology as possibly the last problem to be ever solved in fire science, maybe even after combustion. Do you agree with the complexity of this issue now that you've spent the life of a scientist trying to understand that? What's your opinion? Well, it is a complex issue and it affects us in many ways. Well, it is a complex issue and it affects us in many ways. But I like to think that in terms of evaluating fire hazards for a design and engineering context, that fortunately we can, because of all the work that's been done over the last 30 or 40 years now, we are able to sort of home in on sort of certain key areas and simplify things a bit and make some progress. So I'm fairly optimistic about the future of bringing it into the mainstream of fire engineering, if you like. Do you think it's still not a mainstream of fire engineering? How would you position it? Where is it in fire engineering exactly? Well, obviously, it's being considered a bit in relation to material properties and things like that. in relation to material properties and things like that. But it's not a requirement on any regulatory system. You know, nobody says you can't use that material because it's toxic or that product because it's toxic. And actually, there's a very good reason for that. And this is, if you like, plagued us over the years. And I started to first get involved in this in 1980, when I first started to be involved with ISO on this issue. And at that time, and to some extent ever since, we've been caught in a bit of a problem, which is the distinction between toxicity as a property and as a level of toxicity, and toxic hazard, which is the hazard from toxic effects facing anybody in a burning building. And basically, the thing that's very important is the hazard. And toxicity is only one component in assessing the hazard. And just to put it very simply, if you had a material that was extremely toxic, cyanide, for example, and you keep it in a well-sealed cylinder, or if it's in a material that we commonly use, which nitrogen is that can produce cyanide, if it's protected in such a way that it's never going to catch fire, then it's never going to produce any toxic products, so we don't have to worry about it. But the problem that we face is to look at the way what toxic products are produced in fires, when they're produced, how they're produced, how we can quantify them in a hazard assessment context, and how we can relate them to the hazards of facing the occupants of a building in real time during a fire incident and how it impacts on them, how we deal with that. But there is a sort of, before we get in, and I think that's something we should talk about today, but I think before we do that, it's useful to look a little bit at the overall context of toxicity. I think you hinted at some of it earlier in that combustion products, toxic combustion products are probably one of the most important ways in which human health and survival is affected worldwide. Yeah, in Warsaw where I live, we have a lot of people with coal furnaces to heat their homes. And unfortunately, it's winter now, so it's going through my lungs all the time. And it's not they're burning hazardous materials in their furnaces. They're simply burning carbon in a fairly well suited device that should do that effectively. And yet it impacts the health of everyone around it. So as you said, toxicity is not just a measure. It's not defined in the product itself completely. Of course, product is an important part. So let's try and talk about general, how combustion products create these toxic hazards to people. Yeah, well, just to put it a little bit into context, I think we're going to talk mainly about hazards to people in fire incidents today. But air pollution, the adverse health effects of air pollution kill about 29 000 people per year in the uk is estimated i used to be on a on a government committee the committee on the medical effects of air pollution so i used to work on this quite a lot years ago and of course tobacco smoke is another big toxic combustion product that kills about 100,000 people a year. And this compares to about 300 or 400 people a year that are killed by fire incidents. So, really, the overall pollution side is a much bigger problem. And that arises because when you burn any fuel in your vehicle or in your furnace or in the home or in industrial processes, although we try in most of these processes to make the combustion as efficient as possible, it's never 100%. And the products that are released depend upon the elemental composition of the material you're burning and to some extent on the organic composition of the thing you're burning, the fuel you're burning, but very much on the efficiency of combustion. And so if you get a simple fuel like wood or polyethylene or something like that, which has got just simple carbon and hydrogen and a bit of oxygen as its main elements in its composition, and hydrogen and a bit of oxygen as its main elements in its composition. If you burn it really efficiently in a very well-designed burner, we have a gas furnace to heat our home, which is very, very efficient, then the main products are carbon dioxide, which is a pretty harmless gas to people, water and heat, which is usually desired heat in that context. And so what goes up the flue there is in a very efficiently designed gas burner, for example, it's burning propane or methane, it's pretty good. But there's always a little bit of particulate formed in the flame zone. And that particulate, particularly what we call PM2.5, chrono diameter, deposits in the lungs. And, of course, there are contaminants in most things that burn. So you get various other elements in there like halogens and things like that. One of the things, of course, about burning fuels is that they shuck nitrogen. So you get oxides in nitrogen, which can damage the lungs. NOx is a big pollutant from vehicle exhaust and combustible processes that we're concerned about. And it is one of the things that's produced in fires that people are exposed to. And then, of course, you could also get in some of these things a whole range of organic products, like polyaromatic hydrocarbons. And, of course, from a toxicity point of of view there's a range of different toxic effects so ranging from the sort of carbon monoxide which causes you to become unconscious if you're exposed in a fire so it affects the brain and the heart to phs which i mentioned which are carcinogens and i did a study of this at one point where i worked out that the two things about any particular specific toxic chemical that are important are the toxic potency. How much of this stuff do you have to breathe, in our case, before you have an adverse effect? And the specific toxicity, what kind of toxic effect does it have? And as far as potency is concerned the concentrations of toxic products that are of interest to us in the realm of combustion toxicity range over 16 orders of magnitude i mean that's just incredible isn't it okay so that's going from something like um a few seconds exposure to percent levels of carbon monoxide, which may have you unconscious within a few seconds, to picogram per meter cubed exposures over 30 years to something like TCDD, to dioxins that might be present in the smoke, which can cause cancer and cause hormone disruption and things like that. So it's an enormous dynamic range. This range is almost like going from a match to a nuclear explosion. Absolutely. There's an energy release, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And the timescales we're interested in, as I say, is anything from seconds to lifetimes. And actually, things have gone a bit beyond this now, because we're talking about, I'm talking now about combustion products. So when you burn something, what's coming off? But there's another dimension that's opened up. When we develop new materials, we often end up with a situation where we find some initial benefit, wonderful benefit from a new product or material, and then down the years we find that there are some downsides to some of these things. One of the areas that has evolved as a problem, a benefit and a problem, really, is the use of flame retardants. And some of the compounds that we use as flame retardants are in themselves have become a toxic hazard. We think of the brominated materials, polybrominated ethers, for example have now banned fortunately but they're still around in the environment but there's serious environmental pollutants they're only there because we've used them as fire retardants you don't have to burn anything it's just in the production and use and distribution of those things and we're now finding that some of these other fire retardant treatments sort of things we use on upholstered furniture although they're not volatile they can be released in a sort of dust which you can inhale, and then they can get into the body and cause systemic problems. So although the big issue that we're looking at most of the time is the combustion issue, in our systems and products, we're also introducing or having to deal with these other issues, which are related but not actually due to the combustion process i mean one of the fascinating things about the polybrominated ethers is that they're volatile they the vapor sort of gets into the atmosphere spread around the globe and then it condenses where the areas are coldest and so it's really in the arctic that these things have precipitated out if you you like, condensed out. And why they then become concentrated in marine animals in the Arctic and fish and things like that, seals. So there's this enormous complicated background. But I think, as I say, today what we're really going to concentrate on probably is fire hazards, right? Yeah. And now that you wrote that, when you were discussing this, especially introduction of other substances, basically, if there's no nitrogen in your fuel, cyanide will not form. If there's no halogens in your fuel, you're not going to have products of combustion related to halogens. But then again, if you only have material from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, it still can produce, like a clean timber can still produce a lot of substances depending on the conditions in which it is burned. Okay. So maybe tell me more about the importance of the elemental composition on this. Right. Well, if we look at the combustion process, then just about everything that burns has a high carbon content. So like cellulosic materials, it's about 50% carbon. Plastic like polyethylene or polypropylene is way up in the 90% carbon. So there's a lot of carbon there where the associated hydrogen. And when those things are burned, as I said, if they're burned efficiently, most of that carbon ends up as carbon dioxide, maybe a little bit of char depending on what you're burning. But a proportion is released as other chemical products. And the nature of those other chemical products, I kind of split it into two sets, if you like. It's a sort of set of compounds that you nearly always get when you burn things as common to just about any burning carbon material right and then another set of organic compounds that come off which are more specific to the particular molecular composition of the material you're burning so for example anything you you burn, any carbon-containing fuel, if you burn it, will give off carbon monoxide yields can be quite high depending on the combustion conditions. But some some things are going to be produced in tiny part, a few part per million concentration yields, you know, very microgram yields. It all depends on the toxic potency and the toxicity of that particular material. So one of the products that you are always going to get off is a range of sort of hydrocarbons and you usually get a process called ring cyclization going on in the in the gas zone so so you always get benzene always get some benzene and benzene is a very nasty toxic product not from the fact that will kill you during your exposure to fire, but its potential for toxicity afterwards. If you get partially decomposed organic compounds that are partially oxidized, then you get very irritant compounds called aldehydes produced. And it's the unsaturated aldehydes that are the worst, things like acrolein and formaldehyde, which are very potent irritants and together with the just obscuration from smoke affect people when they're trying to escape from fires. They're important in that context. And then you get things like phenol, which is an irritant acid. And there's a whole range of compounds like that. Then if you think of something like flexible polyurethane foam, which I did a lot of work on years ago. like flextropolyurethane foam, which I did a lot of work on years ago. When that's heated, it decomposes into two components. A polyol, a long-chain polymeric alcohol, which stays behind as a sort of brown liquid, and the toluene diisocyanate fraction, which comes off in the vapor phase and condenses into a kind of polymeric isocyanate, which is extremely irritant. And that's a unique product of this kind of formulation of material, a nitrate-containing product that's produced. So there's a whole range of these sort of things. I think it might be useful for us to talk a little bit about the history of... Yes, yes. Actually, when I first sent you the email that I would love to talk a little bit about the history of... Yes, yes. Actually, when I first sent you the email that I would love to talk about the toxicity in fire science, and I wrote that I would like to tell this was, let's say, explored in 70s, 80s. You told me that we should start much earlier, because in 1948 the fire were not that toxic. And I was like... I found this almost shocking. Like, what do you mean it was not toxic? But you also mentioned that it went all wrong in the 1960s where you just had all my attention then. Yeah, that's right. In that one sentence. So let's make a story out of this sentence. It's slightly tongue-in-cheek, of course. But, yeah, so I think it is interesting. And I think your listeners will find this quite useful. And it's really why I got involved in this thing in the first place. So what happened was in World War II, or before World War II, all the local fire brigades in Britain were under local authority control. There were lots of small fire brigades all over the country. But during the war, it was nationalized, and it was all run by a government department called the Home Office, or the Ministry of the Interior, I think, as the countries would call it. And that lasted for the duration of the war. Then after the war, we went back to local authority control. So you had lots of little fire brigades. But they retained a central unit called the Fire Safety Inspectorate, whose job was to go around and inspect fire brigades to look at their standards and make sure they're all operating in a suitable way. But they also set up a central unit to monitor fire statistics and what was happening in fires in the country. And every time a local fire brigade would come to your local fire, afterwards they had to fill in a form called an FDR-1 with the basic information about that incident, including the number of injuries and deaths. And that was all then centralised and collected. So we have a really good database, starting from about, or the earliest I think I was able to find was about 1952. And at that time we were having only a very small number of fire deaths per year. Most people were dying in the privacy of their own homes. Most fire deaths are in domestic context in the home. It was a number that would be small even for today's standards? Yeah, I was just trying to get a number for you. So it was about 10 deaths per million of the population per annum. 10 deaths per million of the population per annum. Okay? 10 deaths per million in the population. And of those 10 deaths, about nine of them were due to burns and heat. And only about one death per million inhabitants was caused by exposure to toxic smoke. But the cause was because the statistics included some sort of investigation. But the cause was because the statistics included some sort of investigation. So basically, you either were burned to death or you had some signs of smoke toxicity. You died from smoke exposure and not from burns. Okay, but you didn't know that if a person was dead before they burned down, in a way. Well, they could measure the carboxyhemoglobin in their blood, which is a sign of carbon dioxide poisoning their life. Okay, but let's assume nine out of ten burns, the one in cascaded. So in other words, toxicity wasn't really a big issue. And then by the time we get to the late 60s, early 70s, the number of people each year who were dying or injured by burns stayed fairly constant. But the number of people who died as a result of smoke exposure went up by a factor of about four or five. So there's this big, big increase in smoke deaths. And this was happening around the world. What was happening, of course, around about that time was we were moving from the use of traditional furnishing materials in the home, wood, wool, cotton, you know, this kind of materials. If you had a sofa, it would normally have metal springs in it and a bit of wadding, coconut matting or something like that, you know. And we started to use modern plastic material, polymeric materials in furniture. And that seemed to be the source of the problem. And so it was at that time that I was approached by the fire research station to try and understand what was going on. Was there some new highly toxic chemical that was giving off in fires, or chemicals that were giving off in fires that was killing everybody? Was there a qualitative change in fires? Or was it just the way the fires were burning and it was the same old materials and so at that time there was quite a lot of research going in the united states mostly at mist and places like that almost of utah as well and a lot of the work doing there was exposing rats or mice to combustion product atmospheres generated by small-scale apparatus. You burn something in a small pot, and you expose the animals to the smoke for about half an hour, and then you see what kills them if they die, and then you can try and do some analysis of that atmosphere to find out what materials are producing toxic products and how bad they are. There was a lot of interest at that time in looking for what was called super toxic chemicals. Was there something unique happening that was really bad? But when the fire research people came to see me, I took a slightly different approach to this. And I said, well, it's not so much what killed you in a fire that's important, because all fires will kill you if you stay in them long enough. What's really important is what's incapacitating people in the fire and affecting their ability to escape in safety. Why are people not getting out? And so I started to look at the mechanisms of incapacitation. And again, by burning various materials in small-scale operators and exposing animals to the products to see how their capacity to carry out basic actions was affected. And really there were a number of different approaches that people were taking at that time. So, as I said, one of them was to burn different materials and look at the effect on rodents, usually, to see if these materials were producing toxic products. Another was the fire chemistry combustion chemistry and at that time particularly the fire search station and some other places in this there was all of it uh we we started to get gc mass spec became available so you could take samples from combustion atmospheres and look at all the chemicals that were coming off and of course there were hundreds and hundreds of them. So people were looking at those, trying to say what chemicals that are coming off might be the problem. And then another way of looking at it is to look at human data on actual fire instance, human pathology from fire instance. And really all those different methods need to be pulled together to understand what's going on. Really, all those different methods need to be pulled together to understand what's going on. Another method is to expose either animals or people to low concentrations of individual toxic gases to try and characterize how they're affecting people. So a lot of interest in the sort of 60s and 70s up to the 80s in doing all this kind of work. What really emerged from it was that there were only two examples really came out of these unusual severe toxic effects. One of them was Teflon, perfluorinated plastic materials, plastic materials, which under certain very specific combustion conditions could give off a particulate that was highly toxic to the lung, caused very, very severe lung inflammation within minutes to an hour or so of exposure. And that was PTFE and similar sort of products. So that was a thousand times, if you like, in terms of potency, 1,000 times more and more toxic than normal materials that would burn. So that was unidentified. And then there was one other rather strange thing that emerged, and this was from called TMPP, trimethylpropane phosphate. It was a phosphate compound, a kind of organic phosphate, almost like a nerve agent which was produced when you had trimethyl polyols these are used a lot in aircraft um were used a quite a lot in aircraft lubricants and coolants and things like that and when that's combined with another hydrocarbon product you can end, when these things are burned, with a very low concentration of these peculiar phosphate compounds, which cause fitting and nerve effects on the animals that were exposed. But it was a very special case, and once it was recognized, this sort of starting materials were avoided. But it's still a bit of an issue in the aircraft cabin air toxicity area. We're still not, the jury's still out a little bit about whether there's a problem with some of this stuff. If I understood correctly, the research was carried in a way to find if super toxicants exist or how much is there. And then, in fact, you found, or the researchers have found, not so many of them. That's right. And actually, the Teflon is a brilliant example because that's what I have on my cooking pan, if I'm not wrong. And I heat it up vigorously all the time, and I'm still here. There are some very interesting cases. There was a very sad case that interested me in the paper. It's really very toxic to birds and this very sad sad story of a chap who had a parrot in his kitchen uh lived in a kitchen in a cage and he put the pan on the teflon pan on the hob and then forgot about it and so he started to decompose the teflon and apparently according to the article in the newspaper the parrot was calling him and he went back into the kitchen and rescued the parrot but sadly the parrot had already inhaled these toxic um products and sadly died so so in fact the lesson there was if you if you leave your pan on the hob in a very confined space over a period of half an hour or so, you might potentially generate some of these toxic aerosols. But they have a very short half-life because they amalgamate into a fairly harmless, larger particle over a period of a few minutes. So, in other words, to cut a long story short, the search for super toxicants drew up a fact that there's a very rare special cases. And nearly all combustion toxicity is due to the common materials that have been around for donkey's years, you know, so for years. So it's not that there's something very special that's new. What really turned out to be the case was that it was the common products that were the main problem in terms of deaths in fires I'm talking about now. It's the common chemicals. But it was more to do with the fact that those new materials that were introduced, once they were ignited accidentally, the fire growth curve was very steep. And so you got a lot of products, a lot of products very quickly. And they also tended to be somewhat high yields of things like carbon monoxide. And they also, a lot of them had nitrogen, so you tended to get quite a bit of cyanide in there. And it was these kind of compounds that were the problem. But I was lucky because I started working on this in about 1974. And at that time, I was able to interview some old firemen who were coming to the end of their career. You know, they were dead. So they'd been active all the way through the sort of 40s and 50s. And I asked them about this. And they said something to me, which really struck a chord, right? And they said to me, they said, well, when we used to go to a fire in 1950, if a house is on fire, we'd roll up in the fire engine, and the first thing we would do is smash down the door and break a few windows to let the smoke out, and then we'd go into the building, and if there was anybody in there, we'd grab them, and we'd pull them out, and we'd set them on the curve, and we'd pat them on the back a few times, they'd cough twice, and then they'd be okay, right? This is why I said to you that fires in 1951 weren't toxic. And then he said, but by the time we got to the late 1960s, it was all very different. He said, if we went to a fire, we broke a window, opened a door, we just got a more rapidly growing fire and a hell of a lot more smoke. You know, massive smoke, everything, you couldn fire and a hell of a lot more smoke, you know, massive smoke, everything. You couldn't see anything. Great operational difficulty for the firefighters to get into the building and search for the survivors. And so once we did get survivors, if we got them outside, they were in a real bad way. They were sick and they would already had to go to hospital. And so there was a big change in the nature. Was this consistent? Like all you asked gave the same overview? Yeah, it's an anecdote really, but it kind of makes the point. And it corroborates what I found in my experimental studies. In my experimental studies, what I basically found was that when you burn materials, this is in small-scale apparatus, a range of different materials, you really get two kinds, or in terms of acute toxicity, you get two kinds of products. You get asphyxiant gases. Asphyxia means lack of air, if you like, but essentially in a physiological sense, what it means is not enough oxygen is getting to the tissues in your body that need it. So any chemical that blocks the uptake and use of oxygen in the body is going to cause you very severe problems and cause you to collapse and die within minutes or so at the fire scene. And the list of gases that do that is very short. We're very lucky in a way that it's simple. So the only ones you need to worry about are carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and those are the two main ones. And then carbon dioxide is important, mainly because it stimulates breathing and makes you take up any carbon monoxide and cyanide that's present more quickly. So for example, if you inhale 5% carbon dioxide, then you breathe three times as much as air per minute. If you're inhaling carbon dioxide in that air, you take up the carbon oxide three times as quickly, and then you collapse three times sooner. So CO2 is important. The other asphyxiant gas is the lack of oxygen because as far as the oxygen, the oxygen decreases in the atmosphere you're breathing. But that's a kind of secondary consideration, because usually you've been overcome by CO or cyanide before oxygen becomes significant, oxygen depletion becomes significant. If you dropped oxygen below 12%, that means there's like now 7% of something really bad in the air that replaced it. Exactly. So you're already in bad trouble. But all those gases are involved in the FED equations that we'll talk about, perhaps, if we have time. So those are the asphyxian gases. And they're important because they stop you escaping from the fire. They cause you to collapse unconscious at the fire scene if you breathe enough for a high concentration for a short period or a low concentration for a longer period and we've got pretty good equations now to calculate if you if you tell me what the concentration is in the atmosphere somebody's breathing i can tell you how long it would be before they're going to collapse so that's pretty well worked out i think that's great you know we've got a really useful tool there, which I use all the time in incident investigations and modeling calculations. And I think we've got that pretty well ticked, you know. The other main thing that I found when I started looking at these is the irritants. And this is much more complicated because the number of irritant compounds in smoke is much greater. It basically comes down to organic irritants that are formed from anything that burns with carbon in. because the number of irritant compounds in smoke is much greater. It basically comes down to organic irritants that are formed from anything that burns with carbon in. I think acid gases, things like hydrogen chloride from chlorine, phosphate, things like that, nitrogen oxides, things like that. And where my work is going these days is kind of, I think, one of the real issues that we have, and a message that I want to put across is that we need to integrate all our tools and bring them all together to understand these problems. And in the context here, I'm talking about the interaction between human behavior and toxicity. Toxicologists tend to look at toxicity and they love their rats and their slides and their pathology and things like that, whereas human behavior people talk about what happens when the alarm goes off. But there's an interface which is very important, which is where an escaping occupant who's responding to a developing fire situation comes up against toxic smoke and how that affects their ability to escape their behavior and obviously the example i give is supposing you're you're in your bedroom at night and there's a fire in the lounge downstairs and the alarm goes off smoke alarm goes off your bedroom door is shut you get up you go to the bedroom door this is a very common sort. You go to the bedroom door. This is a very common sort of scenario. You open the bedroom door, and the hallway is full of dense smoke, and you can't see more than half a meter or a meter through this smoke. Well, just the sheer physical presence of the smoke and lack of vision is going to have a big influence. You've got to then decide, do I go forward and try and get downstairs to my front door and escape the building that way? Or do I shut the door and call the fire brigade and wait in my bedroom? Or do I try and get out of a window and get out that way, depending on what floor I'm in? So there's a huge behavioral hazard assessment, if you like, that the individual has then got to make. And if they go into that smoke, a proportion of people will carry on through the smoke, depending on its density and the situation they're in. But a large proportion, as Professor Bryan, the wonderful work done by Professor Bryan years ago on wood in the UK, a proportion of people that will turn back as a function of smoke density is extremely important. Because if you turn back, then you're trapped in the fire, and then you're likely to die later, depending on how the fire develops. So in a way, like if you were incarcerated, you're stuck in a environment. Yeah, you're kind of, exactly, you're behaviorally incapacitated. You're not physically incapacitated, but you, it's a combination of the physiology, you know, the physical effects of the smoke on you, in this case, I'm talking about the effects on vision, and how you react to that situation. But it's beyond that, because not only can you not see through that smoke, but that smoke has got irritants in, and the irritants make your eyes sting, they cause a wonderful phenomenon which rejoices in the name of blepharospasm, which is a good name to remember for parties. Blepharospasm is involuntary closure of the eyes due to irritancy of the cornea. I've experienced it a lot years ago when I used to do bonfires in the garden, burning garden waste, and the wind changes and the garden, you know, burning grass, the smoke from the burning grass goes into your eyes. It's excruciatingly painful. You just have to close your eyes and turn away. It lives up to the name. Yeah, yeah. I mean, imagine if you're in a building and you've got to find your way down a corridor to an exit or something like that. How is that going to affect your behavior? It has a profound effect on your behavior. Not only that, but if you inhale it into your lungs, again, your nose, it causes pain to the respiratory tract, breathing difficulties and things like that. The combination of physiology and behavior at the instantaneous effect you're exposed to this is a concentration-related phenomenon. And so what I've been working on more recently is to try and correlate the smoke density visibility conditions with the severity of these kind of things and so for example if you're exposed to smoke in your building and the visibility is 10 meters through the smoke then by definition the concentration of all the other toxic products in that smoke are negligible you know it's safe for you to escape, and most people will escape happily through that kind of situation. But when the smoke density, because the ratios of these things are fairly constant, once the smoke density gets to a visibility of about three to four meters, that seems to be a critical level. Now, three to four meters visibility of smoke, the yield of particulates to produce that, I can correlate with the gases and things that are going to be present. And at that sort of visibility, you're going to have sufficient of these irritants to cause you some problems, but you're also going to have a high enough concentration of carbon monoxide and possibly cyanide, depending on the fuel nexus burning, so that you will become incapacitated. If you then enter that smoke and try to walk through it, I can tell you would have, say, 10 or 15 minutes travel time before you collapse. I need to make this more precise. If you refer to 10 meters, you mean like 10 meters for light reflecting signs with a K factor of 3 based on g i'm talking about yeah i'm talking about reflective not not illuminated so that would be uh that that's actually quite high smoke concentrations of yeah like i don't know the number of my head but i think it's all 11 maybe even more of grams per cubic meter so so yeah i mean obviously i've done a lot of work on human behavior so i mean the kind of guidance that we've put in some of our guidance documents and things is you really need to be able to, if you're going to have a criterion, a design criterion, we suggest that for sort of public spaces where you might have fairly large enclosures, you should have at least 10 meters of visibility because people have got to be able to locate the exits so if you can't see more than 10 meters you won't be able to see where the exits are maybe depending on where you are so if we if we went to a sort of design limit of about 10 meters visibility um then you could ask a question okay if it was 10 meters visibility how bad would the toxicity be and i would say essentially harm relatively harmless. And I think that's a useful tool to say that, you know, that you can, as long as your visibility is 10 meters or greater, you don't really have a serious toxicity problem for survival in a fire scenario. But once you get down to about three or four meters, not only is it very hard to find your way around the spaces, but you're starting to get significant concentrations of toxic products that could prevent you from escaping, even if you went into that. If you tried to go through that smoke, you can now quantify the hazard that you would face. It's so interesting, and you're opening so many pathways to discuss, like, FEDMOL, the production of toxic pollutants as the equivalence ratio changes. I know that's a big thing in your research. And the whole concept of toxic hazards separate from toxicity and discussion on this whole environment in a building, in a fire. Wow, that is so many things to talk about. in a building in a fire. Wow, that is so many things to talk about. I wanted to step back one piece before when we discussed the search for super toxicants and the research done in the 60s and 70s. You've mentioned these were done on rust. I would love to understand how do we know these things, these products? Not necessarily super toxicants, but general combustion products are harmful to us, and how did we establish the knowledge on what concentrations you can be exposed to, which you cannot be exposed to. I know it's also related to the length of the exposure, which then translates to the FED concept, I assume. But if you could tell me a little bit more how we were, how did we find out what kills us and how quickly? Yeah, the FED concept, by the way, has sort of two aspects to it. So one of the aspects of FED was developed to deal with the fact that if you take a single toxic agent like carbon monoxide, during a fire, if you're a person in the building the concentration you're exposed to of carbon monoxide varies considerably with time as the fire develops it's not a constant concentration toxicologists when they do experiments they use constant concentration so we might expose an animal to a,000 parts per million, as I did, of carbon monoxide, and see what effects it has on the animal. And we'll keep it at 1,000 for a fixed period of time to control our atmosphere so that we could then interpret the toxic effects it had. But of course, in a fire, it's varying all over the place. So we had to come up with a tool, if you like, for dealing with this varying situation. And the way we did that was to break the time down into little boxes, if you like, so normally a minute or something like that, or a few seconds. And we'd say, what is the average carbon monoxide concentration during the first 10 seconds, say? And therefore, what is the dose that the occupant is in? So dose is basically concentration multiplied by time, right? So we say, what is the concentration times time dose of carbon dioxide inhaled during seconds 0 to 10 during the fire? So the first switch is from the idea of just amount in the air into the amount you have accumulated in your body for a certain amount of time or the amount you were exposed to. In a simple way. And that's a dose. Yeah, it's a dose. In this case, it's a dose. And a simple dose is to express the dose as multiplying the concentration by the time. So you have a dose in ppm dot minutes, right? And so we'll look at the dose inhaled in the first 10 seconds. And then in the next 10 seconds, you might have doubled the carbon monoxide concentration in the fire, so you get a bigger dose. And then you just integrate the dose under that curve with time and sum it, sum the doses. And we're looking for the point where the dose reaches a level that would cause incapacitation. So you express the accumulated dose as a fraction of the dose required to cause incapacitation. So you express the accumulated dose as a fraction of the dose required to cause incapacitation. So in this case, something like around about... Incapacitation? Yeah, so for carbon oxide, for example, something like, I think it's, I've got the figures in mind, but something like about 30,000 to 35,000 ppm minutes inhaled will cause collapse of the exposed person. And so during the fire, you express the fraction, integrated fraction of that dose from the data you've got in the fire. And when that fraction reaches one, you've got an FED, a fraction effective dose of one, and you say, okay, now the person's inhaled a sufficient dose in PPM minutes during that varying fire to reach a point of collapse okay so that's a fractional effective dose but the other concept of fractional effective dose is that you may not just have carbon monoxide in the fire you might have cyanide in there as well and so you do the same job for the cyanide. You sum the fractional effective dose of that cyanide during the fire, and that's building up towards an FED of one for cyanide. But then, because we believe that both cyanide and carbon monoxide are more or less additive in their toxic effects on the body, we sum those doses. So there's an FED sum for the different toxic products. So it's the fractions of each individual one, and it's the summed fractions of the different ones that we take into account in the FED formula that we use. That's the basic sort of concept. So how do we know what's important? Well, this is where I believe, and what I've done is to look at all the information I can get hold of. So I'm very, very interested in reports on what happened to people in actual fire incidents, what state they were in when they got to hospital, if they were alive, how much lung damage they suffered, in what form of it, how much carboxyhemoglobin is in their blood, and how much cyanide is in their blood, if that was measured. So we can get quite a lot of information from that. Also from pathology of pyofatalities, and a lot of work's been done on that, where, again, you measure the, look at the damage to their tissues and the effects on them. And then you've got industrial accidents, where people are exposed to individual chemicals, like, I don't know, cyanide in a factory or carbon monoxide in a factory, where you've got one specific agent, and then you look at the effects on people who've accidentally been exposed to that. The problem with these two approaches is that we often obviously don't have very good data on the quantity of stuff that they were exposed to. But we know that it's a real scenario, and, you know, so we get useful information from that. The other thing that people used to do, and this is going back years now, the heroic physiologists of yesteryear would expose themselves to carbon monoxide. There's some wonderful papers from the sort of 1902s and 20s where physiologists, there's one in particular I think it was Barcroft who inhaled carbon monoxide up to nearly 50% carboxyhemoglobin which is more or less a fatal dose and then tried to walk up some stairs and more or less collapsed and felt very ill and he had a pretty bad headache for the next six months I think. Unfortunately, it's not permissible to do this kind of work now. But even in the 60s, there was some quite interesting work going on, things like carbon oxide, where volunteers were in states, were exposed, and physiological measurements were made of the uptake. But obviously, they always had to stop short of the dose, which is of interest, if you like, which is the dose that would cause incapacitation to an escaping person. And that's where some of the early work that I did took off, because I was using animals. In fact, there were primates. It was permissible in those days particularly to expose animals for a short period to concentrations of something like carbon dioxide and see how they became unconscious. They would then recover and they'd be perfectly okay afterwards. But I was looking at the effects on their behavior and ability to perform. And one of the tests that I did was I devised a kind of a shuttle box, right? was I devised a kind of a shuttle box, right, where what I did was at one end of the shuttle box, I had a little dispenser that would present the animal with an M&M, a Smartie we call them in the UK, a little sugary sweet. Yeah. And train the animals so that they could obtain this. When I presented this sweet, they could go and get it, and they liked these sweets. And the other end of the box, there was a lever. And so I gave them a signal. When they heard the signal, they went to press the lever. Then they had to run along the box, and it had so many seconds to get to the end and grab the sweet. So I trained them to do that, and then I exposed them to varying concentrations of carbon monoxide for up to half an hour and i monitored the speed of the an alacrity of their response to the stimulus and and what i found was that which i think is quite important it's a very small number of animals and they weren't injured by this but i mean you know obviously some people would find this difficult but what what i observed was that as the level of carbon monoxide built up in their blood and they were exposed it had absolutely no effect on their performance at all they were just as sharp just as good you know everything was fine until they got to a point where they suddenly started behaving as if they were intoxicated by alcohol their movement would become a bit uh you know dodgy and they and within a few seconds of that they would be unconscious on the floor and so it was almost like a i'd call it a physiological cliff from normal state to one of incapacitation and then um you'd stop the exposure then and within within a few five minutes they'd wake up. It's like an anesthetic basically. They'd wake up and then within a few minutes they'd be resuming their task just as well as they had been before. So that I found and that happened that some of the monkeys at a dose of about 30,000 ppm minutes. So if I expose them to a high concentration for a few minutes or about 900 ppm for half an hour. The effects were exactly the same, but the time at which it kicked in varied depending on the dose they inhaled, right? So the monkey did not die, but you could also assume that if they were encasipated at that point and continued to be exposed to the same environment, they would die. They would eventually die if they stopped exposure at that point. And is this like, through research like that, we found the values that in a way correspond to the dose of FED1? Exactly. So I would say that the point about it also was I was keeping them physically active because they have to run backwards and forwards to get these rewards. And when I got them out, I took a blood sample and I measured their carboxyhemoglobin, which is the dose built up in the body of carbon monoxide, and it was about 30% carboxyhemoglobin. So then I compared that with the published literature on humans, and it seemed to correlate pretty well. And the reported effects on humans, and a lot of this done you know in the early part of the 20th century was that people start to first be affected by carbon monoxide poisoning around about 20 percent carboxyhemoglobin people start to report headaches and sort of flu-like symptoms they feel a bit unwell. And the one thing about carbon dioxide poisons is it's so insidious. People aren't aware that they're being exposed. They can't feel anything. So the first sort of symptoms are things like that. And then around about 30% to 40%, you start to get a proportion of people who are collapsing and becoming unconscious. Okay? And if they're removed from exposure, from a short exposure to these conditions, they will recover totally very quickly without being injured. If the exposure continues for a long time, though, you can start to get some brain damage, which can show up later. But a short exposure like that is pretty good, 100% recovery. Once you get to about 50% carboxyhemoglobin, that's the kind of lethal threshold. And in fact, here, I would... See, I'm looking at a combination here of animal experiments and human data. I feel it's so important. And here I came across a wonderful paper by a Polish scientist called, his name is Pach, P-A-C-H. I commend you. You look, try and get his paper if you get hold of it. And what he did was he, I think he looked at 360 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, a lot of them from fires. And he looked at, and the important thing was he calculated the carboxyhemoglobin that was in their blood at the time they were rescued from the fire or the exposure. OK, but the problem is as soon as you rescue somebody from a fire, you give them oxygen and the oxygen treatment washes out the carbon monoxide. them oxygen and the oxygen treatment washes out the carbon monoxide so by the time they get to hospital the amount of their blood at hospital can be much lower than it was at the first scene and so that could confuse the interpretation results but it's possible there's an exponential decay curve for carbon monoxide in blood and so and i've done quite a bit of work like this as well you can back calculate if you know the time when the blood sample was taken and the time when the exposure ceased, you can back calculate to the blood level there would have been at the time of rescue. Okay? And so when he did this, he found a very nice set of data whereby the survival, he was looking at survival, so survival rates for people who are rescued with carboxyhemoglobin up to about 30%, it's nearly 90% to 100% survival. So if you've got 40% in your blood, you're rescued and you're treated, you're almost certainly going to recover almost totally. But once you get to sort of 45%, 50%, then only a few percent of those people will survive, even if they're retreated. So there's quite a steep curve of survival to death, around about 50%. So I take 50% as the kind of lethal dose for carbon monoxide, 50% carboxyhemoglobin. Okay, and that can be related to the dose that you can accumulate essentially, right? Yeah, and the interesting thing about that is you can, what I'm now doing as a sort of tool is I'm using this information as a tool to calculate what fire conditions they were exposed to, right? So if I know that a person escapes a building and they've got, say, 30 percent carboxyhemoglobin in their blood the time they come out the front door, and I know how many minutes they were exposed in the fire, then I can calculate what carbon monoxide dose they inhaled in the fire atmosphere. And that can be a very useful tool, I believe, to validate fire safety modeling. And that's it for this part. Oh, man, I just made a massive cliffhanger. I'm sorry for that. But I do have one more hour of this recording and I had to cut it somewhere and this point made the most sense. So if you reached this far, I guess you are mesmerized by David Spurs' understanding of toxicology and toxic hazards in fires as much as I am, and you would like to hear more about that, and you will have the chance to do that next week. Next week I will publish part two on this interview, in which we go very deeply into the differences between asphyxians and irritants, how we used standard tests on animals to distinguish between them, what other things are produced in fires and how bad they are for everyone. And yeah, we will try to understand how this chemistry of fires has changed over the last decades to make the fires more hazardous than they used to be before. Something that David has mentioned at the beginning of this episode. So I hope you really enjoyed it. I am hyping this as crazy because I must say I have never seen or heard anyone talk about toxicity like this. And toxicity is something we don't talk about much in fires. We're very good at removing chemistry from our profession because there's not that many people who like to deal with it. And it gives massive, massive complexities to the equations. So yeah, it's good to simplify and model that. And actually, that's the essence of what David has been doing. He has been using his astounding understanding of chemical, physiological, psychological phenomena around toxicology to derive models that are simple to use, like the rule of thumb or 10-meter visibility rule. It's a magic number, of course it is, but it has quite a sound basis in it. So I highly appreciate him and his team and his colleagues doing this so we don't have to go that deep into chemistry. Nevertheless, it's fascinating to hear about it. I loved it. Regardless, next week, part two, if you're still listening, I know you gonna be there so see you then cheers bye this was the fire science show thank you for listening and see you soon
