 Hello and welcome to the Firescience Show. My name is Wojciech Węgrzyński and I'm so happy to be here with you. This is a teaser episode. The show is coming on somewhere in the middle of the next week, on Wednesday I hope. It's looking good for the lunch, so I hope I don't miss anything and it will come up. Today I've just finished editing the intro. I will pop it on the end of the episode. I hope you like it. I've spent the last five hours listening to stock music and trying to find this one musical track that doesn't suck that much. I hope I picked well. If not, please tell me. I cannot judge anymore. I think my hearing is impaired after doing this. I'm really happy to finally be doing this. It was in conception for like two years to start a podcast on fire science because I believe that fire science deserves a truly great, a truly great show and, and, and fire scientists, researchers need a venue to share their opinions and findings and research and achievements. So, so I hope I can combine the need of the, I hope I can combine the need of the society to learn with the need of researchers to share in the most fun and entertaining way. My golden standard is having've truly learned a lot. And it was the moments where some groundbreaking moments for my career happened. And it was moments where I've learned some truly amazing things. And I always regretted that it was just a conversation between me and the other person. And actually, what was being said was probably valuable to hundreds of other researchers out there. So that's the idea. And this is what I want to turn this podcast into. That's the idea, and this is what I want to turn this podcast into, a fantastic way to share the knowledge with a you are at your career, I believe that knowledge in here will be very beneficial. And even if you don't learn anything new, at least you'll hear your good friends speaking. And I hope you will just enjoy the show. So far, I have recorded three episodes, three interview episodes with fantastic guests. My first guest was Professor Guilherme Moraine from Imperial College London. And with Guillermo, we have discussed his ERC project on smouldering megafires, which is fascinating. I think that's the only ERC-founded project on smoldering megafires, which is fascinating. I think that's the only ERC-founded project on fire, and that already is an achievement. But what he's done with his amazing team at Hazelab, researching this and growing from small models in their tiny lab in the basement to full-scale burns in Indonesia it's fascinating and I hope you will enjoy that one the second one was with my good friend Gabriel Evine from JVVA in Spain Gabriel is a researcher and he's an engineer, expert in fire modeling. We've discussed visibility in smoke because that's an interesting subject we actually researched together. We have just finished a very interesting survey on the use of fire models and tools in fire. And visibility was a significant part of that survey. So we go through that survey and we go far beyond discussing the role of the visibility in smoke modeling and engineering. So yeah, that one's definitely going to be useful to anyone who's doing practical fire engineering. And my third interview was with Dr. Matty Bonner from Imperial College London. Matty is a researcher studying facades and putting a special flavor on them using artificial intelligence, smart computer algorithms and burning full-scale facades with me and i'm very happy to do that with with him matt is sharing his journey through his phd and wow what the journey that was he actually started researching facades and before grenfell tower disaster and you can imagine being a being researcher on such a topic and then such a tragedy happens and then all the spotlight is on you. So that has definitely put some pressure on him. But I think he managed and I think you'll learn a lot of interesting things about facade fires in that episode. I'm having three or four more interviews scheduled for the next week, so there's already guests incoming, and I'm so happy that people are not putting my emails into spam, and they're so kind and nice to comment and speak to a stranger on the Internet. That's really nice. I also appreciate all of your support. I'm actually overwhelmed with the kindness and support received from all of you. I've never expected to create such an interest over the internet with this project. As a creator, i'm very happy that people are waiting for this people people are already complimenting me even though i have not done anything yet and yeah there's uh i feel there's some hype being built up i hope i can manage the expectations and deliver the best podcast that FireScience had. Well, it's kind of easy because it's the only one on FireScience, but nevertheless, I hope it is truly the best one. I hope you enjoy this. I hope you will be able to join me on June 2nd when this launches and the first three episodes will go live. For now, go and listen to my new intro and let me know if my music choice is really horrible or just bad. Well, I appreciate you being here. I appreciate you waiting for the fire science show to happen. I really appreciate your support in doing this. And yeah, let's go. Let's do this. See you around. Cheers. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. My name is Wojciech Węgrzynski. I'm a professor of ITB in Poland and I will be your host. In the Fire Science Show, I will ask some tough questions to an exciting and diverse experts from all fields of fire science. From students to professors, we will learn from their stories and celebrate their achievements. Thank you for being here. And now, let's jump to the show.
