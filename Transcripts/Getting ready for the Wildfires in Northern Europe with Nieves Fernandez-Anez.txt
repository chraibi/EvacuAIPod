 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. In this podcast, I'm not only trying to give you the best and freshest information from the world of fire science, but I'm also trying to actively find topics that could influence how us fire engineers work in 5-10 years, what challenges we need to learn to respond to, what the future is going to bring to us. And one of such topics that is kind of obvious is how wildfires are stepping into our nice, cool, modern world, especially in places in the world where you would not have them that much. In this episode, I'm thinking mostly about Northern Europe, Scandinavia, but Poland to some extent as well. And I've invited my guest, Dr. Nieves Fernandes-Annes from Western Norway University of Applied Sciences in Norway. And I thought it's going to be an easy episode. You know, I'm going to ask Nieves how bad is the climate change. She's going to tell me it's getting hotter. I'll respond that, yeah, this means more wildfires. She'll agree. Then we will continue commenting on how bigger summers or warmer summers cause more threats. And then we're going to quickly discuss how we can implement solutions from the Southern Europe to Norway. Boom, we have a great episode of the podcast. And boy, I love to be naive in this show. I love to be completely wrong because these are the moments where I learned the most from the interviews I got. This is not so simple. This is truly a tremendous challenge in how countries with different cultures, with different backgrounds, with different resources, with different vegetations, climates, topology, different population density, different transportation networks will respond to a threat that is most likely coming their ways if they like it or not. And yes, we can learn a lot from our friends and colleagues who have been battling wildfires for hundreds of years in their history. But boy, it's not easy to transpose that knowledge. And in this episode, we're covering about the challenges that are involved with just that. And I hope you will also discover something interesting to you that perhaps was not that obvious when you thought about the growing wildfire hazard in climates that have not encountered them previously. So I guess that's it for the introduction. Let's spin the intro and let's hear what Nieves has to say about transferring knowledge from South to North. Welcome to the Firesize Show.

Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm here today with Nieves Fernandez-Anez. Hello, Nieves. Hi, Moishe. Thanks for the invitation. Yeah, thanks for standing with me. We had some technical issues, but we're on a good track to record an amazing podcast episode. Nieves is a Spanish scientist who's now working at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences in Norway. So that must be tough for a Spanish person. How's the sunshine in Norway? We don't know what this is. Well, I hope at least in the summer you will get a sufficient dose of sunshine. But today we're not going to talk about the climate, or well, we're going to talk about the climate a little bit. I've invited you to discuss the things related to wildfires and how the global issue of wildfires, we can all call it a global issue, how does it shift northways? In your career, you've been dealing a lot with biomass, you've been dealing with some clever cellular automata, but you were also heavily involved in this cost action filings where you were looking into the European landscape of wildland fires. And now I thought it's going to be really interesting to discuss how the situation is looking for the Northern Europe, a place where we probably have not had a serious wildfire hazard. I would consider Poland north enough to have the same view of the world. It has not been, we had wildfires, but it has not been like a wildfire season like you see in California or Southern Europe. And every year, it seems it's getting worse. So tell me, how does it look in Northern Europe from your point of view? Yeah, well, we haven't seen a lot of things until now or until the last years. This is something that we face all the time. We don't have fires in the north. We don't have this kind of fire. Well, I can say we don't have more than 30 degrees inside the Arctic Circle. And this was true until, what, four or five years ago. And now we are facing all these changes. Everything is changing. And the thing is that we don't know how it is changing and we don't know what we are facing for the coming years. So we are seeing that the danger is increased in the countries which had had wildfires since always, let's say. The situation is worsening and it is coming up. There are more fires coming to the north and we need to be prepared. So the whole idea is that we know or we believe that this is going to happen. We have to be prepared before it happens. Is it something that's measurable? Like,, we have to be prepared before it happens. Is it something that's measurable? Like, I can feel the climate is shifting in Poland. Like, I remember the winters in my childhood and I struggle to find snow nowadays for my children. I don't think that it is that easy because we have some expectations. We have some predictions every summer. The summer in 2022 was expected to be the hottest recorded, and it was. The summer in 2023 was expected to be the hottest recorded, and it was. But this didn't happen in Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, they were not the hottest recorded, and they were actually mild. This is a very general statement because in Scandinavia, the things we thought from the coast to inland, but there are a lot of things that need to be taken into account, which is that we are not having our fire seasons are not happening in summer. They're happening in winter and in January. So how is climate change affecting gas, but not in the expected way? So it is very difficult to say what is going to come. It's not like a direct shift that we have warmer summer, you have worse firewater. It's more about the dryness of the season and the amount of precipitation you have, the amount of water the plants accumulate. That's how I understood it. Yeah, and it is very complicated because the numbers can be read in very different ways because we are not having a decrease in precipitation. We are having more precipitation in Norway than in previous years, but they come in certain periods. So we have a lot of precipitation for some time and then it stops. And then we have dry periods, which is what we have not used. But if you look at the numbers of precipitation per month or something like this, it doesn't show up. So it is very difficult to find out what is happening. And how is this change? How does this influence the vegetation itself? Are there observable changes in the patterns, how the vegetation develops? I don't know, you have more bushes, more tree growth? We have a lot of bushes in the West Coast where I live, and they are bigger, right, because of the rain. Something that I find interesting also, and I didn't know because I'm a Spanish person living in Norway, is that now what is happening here, for example, is that it is snowing more than before or at least than in the previous years and snow is not good for wildfires because it kind of dries their vegetation like you have the vegetation covered with a snow for a week or or two weeks or whatever happens and then when the snow is removed, what you have is dry vegetation, it's brown. So if after this you have a dry period, then it is very dangerous. And this is not something that I would have thought. I would have thought like, it's just snowing. After this, everything is going to be very wet. Everything is going to be full of water. And this is not what happened. This is very interesting because I would naively think as well, that if you have more precipitation in terms of so centimeters, that's good because that's literally water, but it seems that it's also about how much water can the plants take. When you were working in the FireLinks network, I assume you have had the chance to work with people from all across Europe. How did you discuss these patterns and were the observations similar across Europe from your point of view and your colleagues? So also, just as information, I'm also in a new cost action that is starting now in extreme wildfires. And this is one of the things that everybody is speaking about and that we as a community need to figure out. How are we going to compare things? It's not the same. The fires in Norway are small for many people. What is an extreme wildfire and how are we going to handle this? Because I cannot say that we don't have a problem just because our fires are smaller. It's just that the scale that we are looking at is other than the previous research and the main research that we have. So part of this, how I see it, is that we need to translate things. There is a lot of knowledge. There are great researchers out there that have been working for many years in their particular locations, in their particular situations. Now, how much of this is useful for me? How much of this I can take and implement as it is? And how much I need to translate and how can I translate it? Because the problem that we have, and this is what we are working on as a general topic, is that the models that we have now and the knowledge that we have now is not working for us. The models are not working. They are not predicting and they are not giving us the information that we need. Can you try and define extreme wildfire? When is a wildfire an average wildfire? When is it an extreme and do you only worry about the extreme ones? When is it an extreme and do you only worry about the extreme ones? So the term extreme came because this new cost action is focused on extreme wildfires. And this was the conversation that we were having yesterday. And this is something that we need to address. There is some options out there. There is literature speaking out this. But the fact that I see is that extreme should not be defined as a size, for example. We shouldn't say, okay, if you have 500 hectares, then it is extreme wildfire, because maybe a small wildfire is affecting more people, more vegetation, essential infrastructure. more people, more vegetation, a social infrastructure. Somebody mentioned yesterday in the meeting, what if this wildfires is affecting a specific life that we need to take into account, speaking about animals and vegetation, is this extreme wildfire? So maybe we should look for a definition that says that extreme wildfire, what we cover as extreme wildfire, that extreme wildfire, what we cover as extreme wildfire, means that it is affecting something that is important, or maybe it is on how firefighters can handle this. If we try to protect against the extreme ones, I guess we are protecting against all of them, or most of them, because we don't want them to grow into extreme wildfires. In the previous cost action, in the summary, you have said that we have lack of consistent and detailed records of wildland fire events across Europe. And that was like one of the first findings that you got when you entered this pan-European study. got when you entered this pan-European study. I wonder how is the situation changing, improving, and how those records are created so we get better knowledge of the wildfire hazard across Europe? Yeah, that's a difficult question, actually. But what I have observed, or we have observed, is that the countries that are more managing the problems for many years, like Portugal, Spain, Greece, are better on that. And the countries from the north, yeah, they have a lack of information. In our case, for example, in Norway, we have a database that is available online or by request. And they have introduced some changes in 2023 in the questionnaire that firefighters have to fill after events, for example. So there is a change there and there is some improvement, but it is very difficult to pinpoint what is the information that we really need. Because if you ask me as a researcher, the information that is used for me is not exactly the same that is used for a firefighter to prevent this or to protect against these events in the future. And it is time consuming to get all the data, right? I'm asking this question with a particular interest because, you know, when you have data, you can build the models based on that data to cater for those particular events. I have just a minute ago mentioned that models we have, they do not actually respond to the needs. For example, for Norway, where you are now today. So I wondered, like, where the models are today and is there a good chance that we can actually improve that? But let's try and do modeling. And is there a good chance that we can actually improve that? But let's try and do modeling. So perhaps you could shortly tell me how does one model wildfire events for pre-partner stage or in general to learn about the wildfire patterns? And perhaps then tell me why you think they would not be working that well in your local context. So at the end, what we're trying to do is wildfire models that can help during the event, right? Like you have a fire and can I know where it is going to spread, how it is going to spread? And the spread of wildfires depend on many factors, but the main ones are always wind, topography, and vegetation, right? This is a very brief way of speaking about this, but we're always speaking about these three things, topography, climate, and vegetation. So topography and climate is more or less the same. Like, you just gather the data, right? Like, my climate is my climate. But then, what happens with the vegetation, the vegetation, even when, for example, we have a lot of Calvuna vulgaris, a lot of heather in Norway, the fire behavior that my heather has is not the same than the one that they have in Scotland or the one that I have in the south of the UK. Because the vegetation evolves and vegetation changes depending on how the previous seasons have been. So this is what I think that should be implemented. And this is what we are doing. We are trying to understand the fire behavior of our own vegetation, sitting in the lab and burning stuff to see how the fire spread is and how it is going to advance and how we can handle that. What are the differences? Is it like difference in mass to volume ratios, different amounts of moisture content in the plants, different chemicals inside the plant? I know some plants would have like aromatic oils that would make them more fire prone than others. What are you looking at when you're comparing plants to the ones that exist in known models? Yeah, I'm not an expert on composition, and this is one of the things that we want to look at, which is taking plants from different places and just put them in a TGA and in a cone and seed. If plants have gone through different cycles of fire, fire and rising again and fire and rising again, they are going to be less prone to ignite again, right? You get stronger when you go through this. If you don't have a good management, your plants are going to be bigger, are going to be more dense, are going to be... There are a lot of differences that you can have there. And this is not something speaking about the last few years, we are speaking about an evolution since we have had the plants, right? In Norway, historically, we have always done in this part of the country, we have always done a lot of controlled fires, prescribed fires in Heather, because everybody has always known that it was very damnable and very neatable. So we have cycles all the time. And every year, the farmers, the firefighters, and a lot of volunteers know where they have to burn. It's really interesting because it's not even, you know, different types of plants. It's not just this. You have this one species that is extremely dangerous and you just remove it and you're good. It's more about the life cycle of the plants, the ecosystem itself, how it reacts, how it recovers from the fire, how it grows and accumulates in a way that's different, right? Yeah, I guess that we should never say just remove it. I'm telling you, I would. It's a different, right? Yeah, I guess that we should never say, just remove it. It's made to, right? This is also something that we spoke a lot in Firelings, because Firelings was not only engineers doing fire behavior, which is how I have felt in my life, I guess. There were a lot of ecologists, there was a lot of soil scientists, a lot of people that is not only taking how the fire is. And they were speaking about all this, like fire is also something that is in nature, we need it, and we need it to evolve, and we need it to clean, and we need all this. And the plants need it. But we also have to look at it from the side of the plants, right? Like we, as humans humans need the vegetation and need all this in place. And we need to be careful with it too. I'm very worried about like if the fire engineers response to wildfires is to cut down all the trees, then it's not a great response. And I wouldn't feel that we have succeeded in our job to help others. And that's also something I am very championing for the communication and understanding the other stakeholders in the process and understanding that we as fire engineers are not there to evangelize and tell others how to live. We're to listen carefully what their issue is and tell them what's the most fire safe response to that issue while maintaining what they need. I think that's what successful fire engineering is. Can you tell me more about this collaboration in Firelink? So what were the parties involved and what voices have you had there? You said ecologists. Yeah, a lot of people. It was great. There was a lot of people in there. There were five working groups and the leader was Artemi Cerda from Universidad de Valencia. He's a scientist that has been working on vineyards and some other stuff for a long time. And for me, it was good because, as I said, I think that what we need in the north is communication and is collaboration. So it was great to go to places and just sit down with people and say, look, we're having this problem. How did you deal with this when it was your problem? What can we do? And because there is this sentence that everybody that has been in a field for some time tells you when you start, which is you don't need to reinvent the wheel. And it's true. And I agree. start, which is you don't need to reinvent the wheel. And it's true. And I agree. The problem that I see is that the wheel has not been tested in all the roles, right? We have to be careful. I don't need to reinvent the wheel. And I am very respectful with the work that has been done before me. But I also need to check what parts of the wheel work for me and which parts I need to build new again. And this is what FireLynx was a bit for me, like checking and testing and speaking and discussing. Have you found any specific practices that would be present in the south that could be really useful after adaptation for the northern climate? You've already mentioned that in your region, there is a practice of controlled fires to control and limit the fuel. And I would say the same practice was present in Poland some times ago, mainly driven by agriculture, I would say, rather than fire management. But I remember from my childhood, those things happen. So perhaps other solutions, like what were you able to learn and transpose into the northern system? I think more than activities like this, it was more on how to deal with the issues. So, for example, I remember that I didn't know a lot about the sky fire, so I'm more used to the way of doing it in Norway, and I have been seeing videos, and they do it. And then somebody from Spain saw a video that they had on sky fires, and they were commenting. I wasn't going to say laughing, but maybe better commenting on the fact that they blow the fire with a leaf blower, which is something that they thought that it was like not, you can never do something like this because it is really dangerous. Like just go to a fire and that just blow it. And this is how they do it in here. I'm not sure of what is good and what is bad. It's just like sit down, comment on this and check because this is our way of doing things because we have always done it like this but isn't the best and a operationally for wildfires we have so much to learn from the south we don't have resources we don't have the firefighter tracks we don't have special ones we don't have like all these are things that we need to improve and what i have seen before in many other situations is that normally governments, what they do is that they have a very bad event, a very bad moment, and then they spend a ton of money on something. But they don't really think if it is good or if it is not good. They just freak out. The population freaks out. So we are just going to have put a lot of millions on this to say that we have fixed it. But what if before we have this event, we can actually analyze what is what we are going to need. We have a list. We know it. And then when the millions come, that will come at some point, we don't have to buy things without thinking. We just have the list already. And this is something that the South can help us with. What is what they will say that we need to fight wildfire? You've previously mentioned with the models that you have the landscape, the terrain, the climate, the vegetation. Now, the terrain, I mean, to some extent, it may be similar. It's mountains, valleys, you know, coastline, etc. valleys, coastline, etc. But the way how human encampments are built in those locations, I think there must be a lot of differences, at least to my limited understanding of how Scandinavia looks, which is limited to places where fire scientists practice in Scandinavia. I'm not sure if that's representative for the whole part of Europe that we're talking about, but they definitely look different than Spain or Portugal, where you would have those villages everywhere, at least in the locations which I know. So how does that make your job in taking the solutions from the south to the north different? Because you most likely cannot have the exact same mitigation strategies. You cannot have the same amount and scatter of the fire departments, for example. Yes. So let's start by discussing that. I'm going to focus in Norway now. In Norway, the situation is completely different. Not only speaking about wildfires, but speaking about everything, speaking about cities, everything is completely different. And we have very different areas. If we speak about the West, which is where I live, the West is where the fjords are. Everybody knows about this. It goes everywhere. When I moved here, somebody told me in Haugesund, which is where I live, you don't have to worry about the weather because it is always eight degrees and rain. It's not exactly like this and things are changing a lot, but it is very constant. I mean, you have summer, you have winter, but not very tough winters and summers are also normally rainy and not very hot. While if you go to inland, to Oslo, to all this part, you have very tough winters. The other day when I landed in Oslo, it was minus 19 degrees. But the summers are great for tourism, I'm going to say, not great for wildfires. They are warm. They are not sunny summers, but they are warm. The big cities are Oslo, which is inland or by the coast where we are, there are also big cities. But we are speaking about big cities that Oslo, which is the capital of Norway, has, I think that it is 600,000 inhabitants and is the biggest city in the country. We are 5 million people. So it's not comparable with many things. And then if you go to the north, it's a completely different story because there is a small population, small cities, very dispersed. The population density is completely different. So if we start to speak about the wildland urban interface, it is going to be a completely different story. And their way of living is this. And I don't have to make them change because of this. I have to adjust my solutions to their lifestyle. And you have these cabins in the middle of nowhere because they really like this lifestyle of going to the middle of the mountain. How are we going to protect this? It's something that is really complicated because it's not an issue that we see. In Spain, it's not that normal to just say, hey, I'm going to the cabin and I live in the middle of nowhere. So it is very different and it is going to be difficult to translate. This is what I mean by when the model don't really work is that all these things are not there. Where this discussion is going, I see like two different problems emerging. One would be the fires getting closer to the dense populations and then during large cities like Oslo, where you would be surrounded by nature and you have a dense human population that is suddenly at the risk that they have not been before because they didn't have the fires. But they also see another risk with those extreme fires in remote areas where you would have very limited access for any kind of prevention or response measures. And basically the fire could grow to whatever size it can grow to. And because of how the things are changing, because of the longer dry seasons, because of the shifts in vegetation patterns and growth patterns, it could simply have enough fuel to build larger and larger fires. And you would not have a big chance to actually respond to this. I wonder, are you trying to prevent both? Are you focused on just the wild and urban interface? What are the needs, you know, focused on? I guess that I am in this moment of my career where I want to say I'm going to do everything. But I guess that it is not possible. Right now, I'm focusing on the basis of everything. I'm focusing on the vegetation. I'm focusing on characterizing vegetation. I would like to end up, I have a national project now on this, on the spread of wildfires from vegetation. And my main goal is to also have a complete view of what the needs are, because we don't even know that. We are focusing on trying to give tools that can work, and then we will see how to adjust these tools. Are you working on any sort of tools that would help you quantify, for example, the consequences of the fire to define which fires are worse, for example, the consequences of the fire to define which fires are worse, which perhaps are most cost-effective to fight? Like perhaps a small fire in Oslo is actually creating bigger economical or societal consequences than a large fire in a remote area. I don't know that, but there's a chance. Are we also building tools like that to help us predict where our actions are, let's say, most influential, the best? No, not now, but it should be included in the ADE. Yes. So one of the first things that we detected is that we need better definition of Norway and the risk that we have, definition of Norway and the risk that we have, meaning that we need a map from ourselves saying where the danger is, right? Depending on our specific type of vegetation, depending on our specific situation. Something that I have seen, for example, and this was something that I didn't expect, is that the national vegetation map, the thing that is called from the Civil Defense Directorate, only considers trees. It doesn't have the bushes in the map. For example, so the area covered by vegetation in Norway, this map is much less than what it really is. So if I go to check, if I have something that is going to burn, it may not be in that map. I think that they are changing it and improving it now. But this is how it is now. So these are things that need to be changed. So in the FireLinks report, you've also written that there's increasing frequency and damage of those fires. As fire engineers, I was not really trained well to manage fires coming from outside and endangering the buildings that I was designing. To what extent this landscape is shifting, to what extent fire safety engineers should be aware and knowledgeable about wildfires coming into the image. I assume that in southern countries where the wildfires have been, you know, the part of the culture even, you know, an obvious thing that there's a fire season, they happen. I assume you would have a different understanding, different focus in your fire safety engineering of your common buildings, you know, residential developments, factories, whatever you're building up. Now, with this threat becoming more prevalent in the northern parts, is this knowledge like more obvious? Is it more obvious that fire engineers should be aware of that? And if so, are the actions to actually spread the knowledge to them besides this podcast episode? Yeah, I mean, we have to take that into account and it is going to require some time to make people think on the fact that the fire is not only dangerous if it is inside. It can come from the outside and how we are going to do that. And I feel that it can be easier in some countries and more difficult in others. So I don't know how you are going to come to a person here and you're going to tell them that they need to have 500 meters space around their house or something like this without vegetation. This is not going to be culturally acceptable here, for example. So maybe we need to look at new solutions and maybe we need to try to adjust these solutions to where we are. Or maybe everybody has to just accept it and do it. But it is going to require a lot of time to make this happen. I wonder if this is an area where we could really, you know, transpose the solutions and the best practices from other parts of the world into our parts of the world. Because I'm very sure that we have very basic regulations that tell you the distance from the edge of the forest. And that pretty much is it, you know. As a funny part, we often treat the edge of the forest as an industrial building for many purposes of the fire regulations. So that's kind of interesting. But I've never heard about the concept of defensible space, for example, in our local part where you would design the surroundings of your building. I'm very positive that in future it would. How does it look from your perspective as someone working in those groups? Let me put it like this. You have your Norwegian, you have a colleague, your cabin in the middle of the mountains because this is what you like, this is what you have learned your entire life is this contact with nature or all this. And now somebody comes to you and tells you that you cannot live like this. You have to cut all the vegetation that you have around. You are going to react against it. But, okay, imagine that we have a catastrophe, we have a big fire, and then they understand. The second question that I see here is who is going to take care of that? This management is time consuming, is resources consuming. Who is going to take care of this? The owner of the properties or is it going to be the government? Or what do I have? Do I have to spend all the time that I had free now dealing with this and cleaning around my house? I'm not saying that I support this way of thinking. And yes, this is a concern that is around. You are trying to change the culture that they have, that they have been rising and that they believe in. And apart from that, you are asking them, because I mean, the government is not going to clean everything. It's going to be, each one of us is going to have to clean around. So I'm going to have to use all my personal resources on doing this when I don't even believe in this because people don't even believe in this. And Norwegian society is normally very respectful and they follow rules. And we have a conspire ban, for example, during the summer. So the reality is there. But there is also a basic respect level that you cannot make people change what they are. So I'm going to ask them to change everything that they have believed in and everything that they have raised in and how they want to raise kids and how they want to grow up and everything with something that they don't perceive as a risk. And this is the problem, that they don't perceive that this is going to be a risk. This is, again, comes back, you know, to transposing the knowledge because you have communities that are very well aware that this is a risk. That can give you very clear examples of how big the risk is. Of course, you cannot justify measures in Norway by showing the pictures of, I don't know, wine yards in southern Spain burning. You have to transpose that message so it is understood by the local community and how it relates to them particularly. Listen, we are speaking about this on the Norwegian perspective. So I have, on one hand, I have all these people that think like this, and they don't perceive it. And then on the other hand, I was in this Christmas, and I went to Cáceres, to Sierra de Gata. Sierra de Gata is a place that has had a lot of wildfires along the history. And they had one, I think it was a couple of years ago, which was devastating. And we were in a very small village and we were speaking with the owner of the bar, just about the fire and everything. And he said, look, yes, civil defense and the police came here to tell us that we had to evacuate the village because of the fire. But I know better. I know that the village is not going to burn because it has happened before. And I'm not going to move from my house just because these people come to me and tell me to move. So I stayed here and I was fighting a fire with a bunch of water, just throw water there because I don't think that you have to go because I am used to wildfires. And it is a completely different story on how these people can get to the same point. It is very complicated. These people that have been suffering wildfires since always. This man was speaking as if these were something that he had done several times in his life. And now I'm going to try to translate all this to somebody that has probably never even felt the fear of a wildfire. And it is like this because I grew up in Spain, like I haven't been near by a wildfire, but it's something that has been in my life always. I grew up knowing what I could do, what I couldn't do, seeing the fires in the TV every summer, every summer, speaking out the same every summer, or maybe not in a scientific way, but it was there. But here, we don't speak about it. It's something that doesn't happen. This is really interesting because you cannot really transplant the culture, as you said. It's not just the knowledge, it's the experience, it's the history, it's how the experience is passed from generation to generation. This is very interesting. And this, yeah, I agree, this is going to be a challenge. And it's not only a challenge at the personal level, like what a single person can do to protect their own home, what the local community can do to protect the village. It's at the even government responsibility level. If the politicians have never been exposed to that, they can either underreact, overreact. How does they know what is the adequate response to the changing hazard? And just as the plants cannot evolve quick enough, you know, to adapt to the new shifts in the climate, to the new seasons, to new hazards, in the same way the culture, the politics, you know, the whole societal ecosystem cannot adapt quick enough to this change in the wildfires. This is something perhaps even harder than, you know, assessing the differences in moisture and in the vegetation itself. How do you manage this at this cultural scale? What I am aiming to is to be able to have facts to prove it somehow. aiming to is to be able to have facts to prove it somehow if we are able to prove it in the lab we are able to to show it to the people somehow then maybe they can start thinking like we do but right now is what i told you like things are not happening so people don't know that the fire is hot until they are nearby a fire right and it is a community that are very aware of water fire risk. We have wooden houses everywhere, and they burn. I have seen several houses here in Hawasun tear to the ground because of a fire. And they are very careful with this, and they have restrictions with this, and they have everything, just because I have seen it. Like my neighbor's house burned, for example, and this is when they react. restrictions with this and they have everything, but just because I have seen it, right? Like my neighbor's house burned, for example, and this is when they react. So what I really expected, and let me phrase it in a correctly political way, is that when these fires happened in 2018 in Sweden, the big horrible fires that were there, I thought that this was going to be a change. Because it's not your neighbor's house, but it's the neighbor's house. And that this was going to be a change more than in the government, which I guess until we are losing resources is not going to change. I hope that it was going to be a change in the people. If this happens in Sweden, which is the cousins, whatever you call them, it can't happen here. But it didn't. They still don't see it as clear as I thought that it was going to happen. And the last thing that I wanted to talk with you, perhaps this is less related to Norway itself, but in general, the theme of fires moving to the north. There is a completely new set of ecosystems now more prone to fires. I'm thinking about the tundra areas. I'm thinking about the boreal petlands that are now exposed to wildfire risk more than in the past. I wonder if we as fire engineers or even as societies, can we catch up with that? Because the amount of new hazards, in my view, is so much bigger than the increasing resources that we have in the management. How do you view this shifting risk in like the next decade or two and based on your connections through the actions how is the the scientist community aware and responding to this shift i don't have an answer i have i guess that i have i hope or what i see in a way is that it is very difficult because when you start speaking about soil, we start speaking about a different problem. I mean, is fire? Yeah. But then we're speaking about smoldering. We're speaking about a different kind of combustion phenomenon that behaves in a different way. that behaves in a different way, that modern combustion has been less researched than planes in a very general term is less known. There has been very big efforts from science engineers in the last years. I mean, I started at Imperial in 2016, and they were already working in smaller need fields. But there have been several very good researchers, and they are doing large-scale experiments. So the research is going on. I think that it gets much less attraction than what it should. People don't seem to feel that it is as dangerous as it is, or this is my feeling of it. You know, smaller it is, it's slower, yes. But since this zombie fires started in the north, north, north, I think that this has been a good point for people to understand that this is happening. The thing is that we have a very big task on smoldering of soil itself, and we have a really big task on the interaction between wildfires and smoldering fires in soil, which is something and transitions from smoldering to flaming and from flaming to smoldering and deal with this. I don't think that is something that we're going to see or feel that it is solved in 10 years. I'm asking because, you know, just seeing the direction where things are heading, it doesn't take much to expect that this will be an increasing threat. I rather expect this to be an increasing threat rather than expect this to not be a threat in five years on its own. I see the trends. I see it changing. And again, like what you've mentioned, the research done at Imperial, that was the first podcast episode, actually, of the Fire Science show, where I discussed this with Guillermo, his research on Indonesia. And again, I think as a set of experiments, a set of experiences from very deep south or near equator, that perhaps will be more and more relevant for the north. Again, a challenge in how to transpose this knowledge that was gathered somewhere and apply it for a completely different ecosystem, terrain, weather, and vegetation. Again, something you said we should not reinvent it from the scratch. We should take and adapt and adjust because we simply don't have time to reinvent it. That's why I wrote it in here and knowing that you're among the leaders that lead this change and this transfer of knowledge, You're among the leaders that lead this change and this transfer of knowledge. I'm happy that these are things that you are currently working on and thinking about how to actually put them between a smoldering and flaming, that currently we don't even have extinguishing system for smoldering fires. We don't know how to do it. We don't have water to extinguish. We don't know how to do it. So how are we going to fight it if we don't even have this? How are we going to fight it if we don't even have this? I've heard about experiments. I hope I'm correct. But I think they had a torrential rain during one of the experiments in Indonesia. And that even did not put out the fire. So if a torrential rain doesn't, then that's not great. Nieves, we need more knowledge. We need to share knowledge we have. So perhaps for the end we can direct people to some resource bases. Are there any resources from the Fire Links or from the new COFS action that people could refer to if they would like to be more informed about this overall challenges in how fires spread across Europe and differences between the countries? Where could we direct people to? spread across Europe and differences between the countries, where could we direct people to? We have, the findings had a website where we were uploading everything. We had a long paper with like 90 authors or something like this, explaining the situation in Europe, which I will recommend. But to be honest, my main recommendation now that we are starting this new course and everything that is going on is for people to reach to reach cost actions to reach other people we are not going to be able to fight all that is coming without collaboration and without communication and something that I have learned in the last years is that there is a lot of people willing to help, willing to speak, and willing to mentor, and willing to follow up. So reach people, speak with people, and share what you know, because if not, we're not. This COST Action, is it open now? Can people join at least as observers? Yes, the Extreme Wildfires COST Action is just starting. My work group had the kickoff yesterday, so we are on the way. How timely. People working on extreme wildfires are interested. There is a website in the cost action where you can just click member, join as member, or something like this, and we will get your information. Given the opportunity, can I ask you a personal question? Because there's a lot of young researchers listening to this podcast and people often wonder to what extent that participation in the communities like COPS is interesting, beneficial. What's your statement? Like, I know you've been a part of the cost before. Now you're entering another cost action. How do you view those actions from a perspective of a young scientist? Would you recommend joining such an action? I think that it is a great place for networking and for meeting people. But being very honest, as a young researcher, I think that it depends a lot on the situation that you have in your workplace. My situation is that my university encourages us to do this kind of thing, so they help us to do this, but there's not funding, right? There is not funding for research. Costs are for networking. And how, like, how much work is it really? I'm in the construction of a land for a holistic approach to timber, and it's very flexible. Like, people who want to do more can do more. People who just want to be in the meetings, I guess it's fine with them just being at the meetings present there. So you can dose the amount of work you take on yourself. How did it look in your case action? Same. If you want to be more active, you're going to have opportunities to be more active. If you're busy, I mean, it's very difficult to get commitment for four years for somebody to work a lot. So life changes and maybe something that you think that you cannot do afterwards. So it's very flexible, and you can put the effort that you consider. And if you are willing to collaborate, you are going to have opportunities. So, yeah, I'm very positive towards this. Thank you. I think it's the first time I've discussed cross-actions on the podcast, so thanks for this little insight. Great to have your opinion. Nieves, it was a pleasure to have you in the podcast. So thanks for this little insight. Great to have you up in Nevis. It was a pleasure to have you in the podcast. Can I put something here now that we are on it? Absolutely. I am also a co-chair of the Diversity, Equity and Integrity Committee in I IFSS. And this can also be a good way of collaborating with the community if anybody is interested in it. Absolutely. And there's also the subgroup for emerging young researchers, which I would also highly encourage young researchers to join. Collaboration through IFSS is also very valuable. Thank you for this plug-in. Appreciate it a lot. Niemes, it was a huge pleasure to have you in the podcast. It's a very interesting thing to try and take knowledge from the South and interpret in the North because of how the world is shifting. And I assume this is only going to grow. The amount of researchers researching these topics, the amount of problems, unfortunately, that we have, the amount of research that's going to be needed. So a very interesting direction for fire safety engineering. I wonder if we could foresee this 20 or 30 years ago. I don't think we could. But today I foresee that it's going to be on the growth in the future. Fantastic to have leaders like you working on this already, and all the best for your future. Thank you, and thanks for the invitation. It was a pleasure to be here. Maybe we can repeat this in five or ten years and see what the situation is. I'm booking already for the—I know it's hard to book you, so I'm booking already at the end of the Extreme Wildfire Cost Action. We need to do a repeat. Put it in your calendar in 2020. Put me somewhere in 2026, please. Thank you, Nieves. And that's it. Thank you for listening. It seems I have summarized it already during the end of the conversation with Nieves, so I'm not going to summarize with the same words once again. This is it. An interesting direction for fire safety engineering, something we should be more aware of, something that will influence our profession in short time, I think, shorter than longer, and something we need to think about more. Also, the transposition of knowledge from south to north, not as easy as I thought, is not just about showing pictures of burning mountains and telling people how you prevent that. It's a social cultural challenge that we need to find a solution for. And I'm most thankful to Nieves for sharing this with me. Thank you for listening to this episode. You may have noticed the sound quality is a little different than usual in the Fire Science Show. This is because I was recording this from my backup Fire Science Show vehicle. I've lost my internet connection in the place where I was supposed to record. I had to quickly figure something out. I've literally recorded this episode at the supermarket parking. I was not kicked out of it for recording a podcast episode about fire. That's great. But unfortunately, the quality is not as in my beautiful fire science studio closet, which I use right now to record this short message to you. Anyway, thank you for enduring with the quality and I hope it was not deteriorating your podcast listening experience. And in future episodes, we're back to good old Fire Science Show Studios quality. Thank you very much for being here with me, and I am looking forward to host you here once again next Wednesday. See you there. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
