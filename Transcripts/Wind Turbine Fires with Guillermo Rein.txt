 Hello everybody, welcome to the FarSightShow episode 150. Wow, the time flies by so fast. I've just recorded the episode 100 and it seems to be a year ago already. As you hear this broadcast, I'm somewhere in the world enjoying my hot end vacations, but as they say, the show must go on. So here we are with this hopefully lovely episode, and I've invited the guest with whom it all started with, Professor Guillermo Reyn from the Imperial College London. I've let Guillermo pick the topic for this episode, and he chose to speak about wind turbine fires. A very interesting topic, perhaps an overlooked problem in the world of engineering, perhaps not a big deal. Certainly something we have a problem with, deciding if it is a problem or not, because the industry is not really helpful as in engineering fire safety of those devices. It's kind of an interesting problem of how to prevent the fires, how to mitigate the consequences of the fires. What can you do inside a wind turbine? Because you can imagine they are pretty remote and not very well accessible. So in case of a wind turbine, if there's a big fire growing inside, there's not very much things you can do. So, well, fire safety engineers know their craft. They can create fire safety solutions for devices like this, but they have to be allowed to do that. And in some way, the industry is not really looking for that help. And that gives this episode, this discussion, an interesting twist. So, yeah, I think it's going to be a very interesting episode for you all. So please let me invite you, together with Guillermo Reyn, for this episode on wind turbine fires.

Hello, everybody. Welcome to the FireSense Show. I'm here today with Professor Guillermo Reyn of the Imperial College London. Hello, Guillermo. Welcome back to the podcast. Hello, Bojie. Good to be back. Thanks for inviting me again. You have a lot of patience. Well, and you have this free ticket thing that you can just redeem whenever you feel like it. So just send me an email and we'll do another one. Anyway, for this episode, you have chosen a very interesting subject to talk and that is the fires of wind turbines and in general, wind turbine fire safety. I guess we can place this within the broader scope of renewables, sustainability, and fire, a gap that needs to be closed. And when I was researching, I found your paper from Edinburgh Times published in the IFSS 2014. So we're at the 10th anniversary of your paper. Has much changed since then? The topic, no, has not changed for bad reasons. But the fascination has not changed either. It is a very interesting topic. It's a new hazard. Having wind turbines. I'm a mechanical engineer. I'm obviously fascinated by wind turbines. All turbines. Yeah, and it's for wind, which is important for you, Bocce. And it provides energy and is renewable and is literally, it could not get better. But I'm a forest scientist, I'm an engineer. So at some point when we were in Edinburgh, we got in the news this fascinating, unfortunately fascinating images of a wind turbine on fire. You know, it's fascinating in particular because the smoke becomes a tracer. You can actually visualize the flow of the wind turbine in the wake. So we wonder, is this one off or this happens with more frequency? So we got two students, two master's students for the IMFSE. At that time, I was in Edinburgh, so I could supervise them. And we got two of them. And we got together with Ricky Carville and David Lang, and the team, the five of us, did the study. What we found is that we were the first ones, as scientists, to look into the problem. We found that the data existed a little bit. We found that there was some knowledge of why these fires were happening. We saw knowledge of the frequency of them. And obviously, as fire engineers, we immediately identified the ways to address them. And that was when the students graduated and they went to work for industry. And then we published the paper. That was when the Steelers graduated and they went to work for industry. And then we published the paper. So you said you were looking into the problem based on a single off incident that triggered. I think I know which video you refer to because it was quite viral. Perhaps many of them were viral with this beautiful circles of smoke leaving the burning turbine. leaving the burning turbine. And obviously, since then, I think I've also been, at least I've been noticing, you know, those fires in the media. And they seem to happen every now and then. Do we have an estimate of how big problem is that overall? Like, how often do those fires happen in the industry? Yeah. So I'll tell you, I'll answer that question, which is the single most important question in the topic. I'll answer it in three parts. The first part is I think, in spending some time into this, that these fires are rare and they are not the end of the world and it is not the end of the wind turbine industry. Okay, that's the first answer. The second answer is, when we look into the data, we do see about, for example, when our team did the analysis, we saw about one every 10,000 turbines, one fire every 10,000 turbines, which is literally, you can just neglect it. When other people have done the studies, they have found one every 2,000 wind turbines. That starts to become a little bit too close to comfort. One in 2,000, take into account one turbine is about 2.5 million US dollars. And every year that they are operating, they produce 12 million US dollars operations. So when you lose a turbine, you lose your initial investment, but you also lose a lot of money every year that this turbine is not producing anymore. So having one fire every 2,000 turbines is uncomfortable. But we didn't see one every 2,000. We saw one every 10,000. And that number is much more easy to manage. And the third part is I should not be answering this question, Borgio. We should not be answering this question. We are in this role today. We are scientists. It should be the industry who is answering this question. And when we asked industry, they told me, yes, we have the data. And no, we are not going to tell you. And then I thought, OK, as a scientist, that's intriguing. Why they don't want to tell me. But at the same time, they want to tell me, don't worry, Guillermo, go to sleep. You don't have to worry. It's not a problem. But no, we're not going to show you the data. It's like, I'm a scientist. My arguments for me run based on numbers and knowledge and hypotheses and testing. You cannot tell me, that's okay, Guillermo, go somewhere else no problem here. Nothing to see here. That only made me really wonder what is the number now and I guess at some point someone from the industry, from the one turbine industry is going to be listening to this podcast so I have a message for them release the data, find someone that independently will look into your data and will be able to answer this question. When you told me this could perhaps be an interesting topic to talk, first I was kind of like, is it really a good topic for a fire science show? And then when I was thinking a lot about those wind turbine fires, I think it's a brilliant place where you could really well explain the value of fire safety, you know, because you have a very isolated device, the wind turbine itself. To the best of my knowledge, they would not propagate between the turbines. Okay, there's damage to surroundings, and we'll probably touch that, but it's not that you have one turbine on fire and the rest of the park will get. And you know how much they cost to build. You know how much they produce per year. You know how much you would like to use them. So the loss is like the most, you know, sharp you could have in fire safety. Because you can tell up to like perhaps $10,000 exactly how much this fire has cost. And you can also perhaps in dollars tell how much it will cost to provide some, you know, equipment that will reduce it, you know. And don't forget that it's impossible to miss them. We were studying, we found more than 300 wind turbine fires, like each of them with a date, a location, and a photo and knowledge of it. 300. And we use social media because there is no other way. So imagine how difficult it is to hide these fires from happening, and then even social media reports on them instead of being the authorities or the owners or the neighbors. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of fascinating. Let's go deeper into this. I'll tell you, we learned a lot in this work. We produced the paper that you referred to in 2014, and then we have a follow-up paper in 2021, where we revisit the problem. And we continue on this. This was an article, not a paper, an article in the Society of Fire Protection Engineering Magazine. I'll tell you what we found. What we found is, I want to highlight this. I don't want to get excited and get people wrong on this. I love renewable energy. I support wind turbine industry. But when we learned about wind turbine fires, we realized this was actually the dream of an arsonist. You take flammable materials, different ones, some solid, some liquid, multiple of them, and you put them in close proximity to multiple ignition sources, mechanical and electrical. And you put them very close to each other. You put them with plenty of oxygen and wind to make sure that things go, you know, when they go, they go well. And you put them very far away from the firefighters. So everybody can see them, but the firefighters cannot reach them. That is, in a summary, a wind turbine. So the fuels, for example, are the large amount of polymers of plastics that are used in the nacelle. There is a lot of metal components, obviously, but there is a lot of composites, there is a lot of cables, there is a lot of insulation. Sorry to interrupt you. The nacelle is the part where the gearbox and generator is hosted, and on top of that, you have the blades. I hope that's the correct methodology. So, if you could go once again, like, what's inside the nacelle, and which parts of that are actually, like, flammable material, fire hazard potential? So, the three main parts of a wind turbine are the tower, which is hollow, and there's maybe cables going through it and a ladder to go up. Then the nacelle, which is the big part, which is bigger than... I mean, it's a multi-story room. It's not a small room. It's a big room. It's called the nacelle. Kelly doesn't have windows, and it's just a big block where the engine and all the machinery is inside. And then it has the blades, which are attached to the nacelle. And inside the nacelle is where you have the gearbox, you have the mechanical elements, you have the electrical generator, and then you have the cables and the controls, and the cables that go down to carry the electricity that has been generated in the nacelle. Is the electricity converted already at the level of nacelle, or it's a separate thing on the ground? Inside the nacelle. Inside the nacelle is where the energy is converted from mechanical in the shaft of the blades, is converted into electrical energy with a generator. I meant more like a transformer station where you would convert the voltages, but that's probably not the third way. Yeah, that's true. It has a little bit of a transformer to control the quality of the signal at source, but that is something that typically is done at the farm level, not at the cell or turbine level. And which parts of it are combustible? Other than, I mean, literally, no, a nacelle is, I mean, to give you an idea, a nacelle would be almost like a flat, a two-story flat, London style. It's completely full of stuff. It's very warm. The nacelle, when it's been operated for a very long time, as it's meant to be, becomes a very warm environment. There is heat that is being released inside by multiple reasons. And it's very noisy and it's full of electrical parts and mechanical parts. So it's a dangerous place. It's not a place for anyone to be. Fascinated for an engineer, unpleasant for other people. And there is a very large amount of polymers, plastics, inside a nacelle. The shell of a nacelle typically could be, and it is now made of composites, which has a level of flammability. There is a lot of cables, many hundreds of meters of cables, which the insulation of the cables is made of polymer plastic. And it has insulation for heat transfer and for sound of different components and different parts of the cell. That's also flammable. And then it has oils. Oils for the friction of mechanical parts. Oils for insulating the electrical parts for the transformer, etc. And a great majority of these oils, not all of them, are flammable as well. And what about the blades? Like, are blades flammable? I'm pretty sure... Yeah, the blades are made of very light composite, very light, very strong, very large composite components, and they are flammable. It doesn't happen frequent that the blades themselves get on fire. What happens more frequently in a fire is that then a cell gets on fire, but the blades themselves can also burn. And there are images of blades burning and spinning at the same time, which is a weird image. So if you look at those fires in the wind turbines, it's not that it's a very tiny fire, it went down on its own, usually they would propagate. And if they did, they would have consequences probably fatal to the entire building. I wondered, like, how many fires grow to a size where they are actually, like, destroying the entire turbine. So what we saw in the data is when there is a fire in a wind turbine, it, most of the time, 90% of the times, it leads to the complete loss of the nacelle. So there's no way you can repair. You had a fire, you lost the nacelle. That's it. And then two things can happen. One is that it burns out and you lost the nacelle and you have to put a new nacelle, or the owners have to put a new nacelle. And that's it. And it's only an economic concern of that specific investment. People might have seen it. My team might have seen it. Maybe my team didn't see it. The other thing that can happen is that the fire starts to burn and it starts to throw debris, metallic and otherwise pieces of plastic that are burning. They fall on the ground. They ignite what is called a secondary fire. This is more concerning because a secondary fire could actually go much further away than the single nacelle. And in principle, the responsible person would be the owner of the nacelle. And this has happened. About 10% of the cases that we saw, I highlight that we saw because the industry doesn't see the data. 10% of the cases that we saw led to secondary fires. Some of them were burning the grass around the farm. Some of them were burning the factory where the nacelle was. Some of them were burning nearby infrastructure. So secondary fires is a concern because it is difficult to deny where the ignition source was. Is it like an effect of parts of the blades flying away at large distances thrown away by the rotation or more like a firebrand stuff caught by the wind? My imagination is going quite crazy about throwing big chunks. That would be a huge firebrand. They already fall far without the need of the centipugal acceleration of the blades turning. The blades burning, it happens very rarely. I would say blades maybe is actually about 5% of the fires in a turbine. But the production of fireibrins is always, every single turbine fire produces fibrins. There are pieces of different things that are burning and they start to go a high altitude with wind. So they can actually fire hundreds of meters away. And this is despite that every wind turbine farm protects the immediate vicinity. They're aware of, for different reasons, that they should tear the grass and they should not have flammable things next to the tower. And even doing this, 10% of the fires lead to secondary ignitions. In your SFP paper, I read the mention about a fire that happened in Riverside, California. So perhaps you can bring it up to the listeners to show how this can spiral up a little bit. Yeah, so this is just one of them. If we saw 10% of them, we saw literally about 20 or more, or we studied fires that led to secondary ignitions. But this happened in California, I think it was in Riverside, in the summer of 2012. And it was a wind turbine, caught fire. The firebrand's trouble ignited surrounding grass, which was not immediately surrounding the tower, the turbine, because that grass had been removed, rightly so. It went to the farther away. So it means that the firebrands were reaching unexpected places for the owners. The owners were caught by surprise. And it led to the burning of a nearby forest. It led to almost four kilometers square of forest burning. Which is, I mean, it's a small wildfire for wildfire scientists. We're talking about much bigger wildfires. But taking into account that it was undeniably who was the ignition source, this in the U.S. is very important because the ignition source in the U.S. pays all the consequences of what happened. So the owner of this wind turbine had to pay for this, for the expenses of the cost of the damage that it had produced. And if he had gone wrong, imagine that this was not a small wildfire. Imagine that this happened on a windy day. Not too windy that you have to turn it off. They went to rain on a decently windy day in the summer. California, a beautiful place I've lived there, where the vegetation is dry. So maybe there's a heat wave. And then instead of a few kilometers square, we start to talk about dozens of communities having to evacuate. And then people start to pay more attention. Unfortunately, when these bad things happen, then people start to pay more attention. Okay, another thing that we have not touched yet is the ignition. In many fire considerations, media would usually focus on what was the cause of an ignition. For us, it's just one part of the switches that we try to solve. But do we know the typical causes of ignition in such devices? Yeah, there are many different reasons for ignition. When we look into the data, the leading cause of ignition is lightning strike. Okay. Which is funny and not funny because all wind turbines are already protected against lightning strike. So if they're already, because you don't want electrical signal, artificial signal going into the turbine. So if you protect them against lightning strike, and still this is the leading source of ignition, it means, right, power engineers are needed for sure. The other reasons were mechanical hotspots. So the maintenance of the nacelle for whatever the reason is not as good as it should be, or maybe there are mechanical defects. Then mechanical parts are in contact with each other, maybe in the gearboxes or maybe in the shaft. They start to heat up. We use hot spots because we are surrounded by seals, liquid and solid, and the hot spots become an ignition source. And the third reason is the electrical arch, which is when some of the electrical elements, they are not isolated from each other. It creates an arc, and then the arc is a beautiful, unfortunately, ignition source for soluble elements that might find in the vicinity of it. But from the statistic, majority of lightnings, right? The leading cause, when we look into the data, was lightning strike. It really caught our attention, because every single wind turbine, since they were invented, obviously, are protected against lightning strike, they are like begging for a strike to deal with the leading cause of fires. Even if you were to design them better so that lightning strike doesn't become an ignition source, we still have to deal with two other very different ignition sources, the mechanical and the electrical. So this is a fantastic problem for a fire scientist, because you have multiple fire problems, not just one, and then you bring something and it's solved. It has multiple things that is needed that the designers and the owners need to understand. One thing that makes me curious, do those challenges scale up with the size of the turbines? Because we also know that the turbines are growing and especially the turbines installed overseas. There's a big wind farm project in Poland and those are some massive, massive turbines. Not like anything I've seen on the ground. So, I wonder, is there a difference based on the size or just like... Well, if nothing else, I mean, the thing is every wind turbine is evolving the technology is evolving in size but it's also evolving in in type of technology and material so it's very difficult to compare then as you make the wind turbine bigger you're bringing more fuels it's interesting that the industry is not bringing less fuels it's bringing more fuel in the sense i mean something that is slow fuel as a for a out for a fire engineer. As you increase the power, you increase the strength of an arc. You increase the strength of a mechanical failure. So as you make it bigger, you bring the hazards developed in size to be bigger. And the loss is bigger. It's not the same losing a cute, small, one megawatt turbine than losing one of these monsters, which they have now of 10 megawatts. The economic loss and the amount of debris they will produce as firebrands, it is much bigger as the wind turbines grow. Hopefully, the ones installed at the sea will not cause a secondary fire. It would be interesting, though, if it hit a ship nearby. That would be a very bad luck. I can imagine such a scenario, though. No, but you know what is the problem with the ones that stay? It's actually fascinating, Volian. I have all this. It's not that you can go into a textbook or there's a little manual. All these, I had to scratch it from different people I've been meeting for the last 10 years. Each of them giving me a piece of information and then getting it together. It's evacuation. The turbines in the sea are visited for maintenance by technicians way more often than the ones inland. And when they visit, they stay there for longer. Sometimes, actually, they have to sleep overnight several days while they fix the issue at sea. they have to sleep overnight several days while they fix the issue at sea. If you have a fire in the wind turbine while there is people in the nacelle, it is a very dramatic situation because they are rarely designed for evacuation. And unfortunately, there have already been fatalities of technicians that were in the wind turbine when the fire happened. This is something that industry said this will never happen. It's so infrequent. It's so infrequent. Well, unfortunately, it happened. And the only time that I've seen the industry gain more than five minutes of attention to fire safety was actually, unfortunately, when these two people died in the Netherlands. I think it was in 2014. I think it was. For sure, it's not a space designed for escape. And for sure, it's not a space designed for escape. And for sure, I mean, based on my general knowledge in buildings and building systems, while ongoing maintenance is a much better chance to get a fire than in normal operations. I mean, there are yeah, yeah. That was the fourth reason. The easier to handle is hot works, which is they have technicians doing something, soldering or welding, or they have, they're putting asbestos or something, and they themselves become the ignition source. That and they're a nice place for fire to grow. They have some ignition sources more than sufficient to set the thing on fire. What can we do about the fires? It's quite fascinating, isn't it? So are they even equipped with detection systems and the active passive fire protection tools? Well, so the answer is we could do so many things. I mean, not us. They don't want me to do this answer is we could do so many things. I mean, not us. They don't want me to do this. But they could do so many things. I'm tending to this becoming a textbook case for teaching fire engineering of all the things that could be done. And most of them are not being acted upon or when they are acted upon, they act in secrecy. Because you know what happens? The industry says we've invested into protecting them. Protecting them from what? You've been denying that this was an issue for the last 15 years. What are you protecting them from? So the industry has created themselves a situation where now they cannot even say that the assets are safer or that the assets are now being protected because they've been denying the problem for too long. or that the assets are now being protected because they've been denying the problem for too long. You know, I believe in explaining what fire engineers can do by explaining the layers of protection. As many layers as possible should be put between the fire and the asset we want to protect, this being life or property and environment. And it is not right from my point of view to just put one layer. You have to put multiple because no layer, no single layer is perfect. And the more you put, you drastically decrease the chance of a fire being able to breach through more than one layer. And the most popular layer, the one where I've met more people talking about, there is immediately the suppression industry. So now with blinking eyes, with dollar signs in their eyes, what an opportunity. We are going to put suppression system in every single nacelle. And the industry pushed quite hard into this. They developed a few suppression systems, which are specifically for nacelles, for wind turbines. They work. I've seen results of this. They work. Some of them are based on gas flooding. Some of them are water mix. Some of them are sprinklers. They work. They have two problems. One is they're expensive and the industry doesn't have a problem, they say. So therefore, why put money into something that is not a problem? And the second one is they make the nacelle heavier. It's important that the nacelle is light. Obviously, you have to store bulky material and water or different agents. And that means that designers, some of them have put through pressure systems in the nacelle, but they dislike it tremendously, Boje. I've met designers of leading wind turbine companies, and they were looking into my eyes. I was giving them a presentation with my data, and they looked into my eyes and I was giving them a presentation with my data and they looked into my eyes and they said, I don't want this in my wind turbine. And I said, why? And they said, because we don't need it because it's too expensive. It's too big. And I thought, and when do you come up with a number for safety? When do you come up with a number for I don't know, it has to be a threshold where the number of fires starts to trigger the requirement for technology. That was not the conversation. And he was a leading engineer. He, well, all of them, there were many of them. The second layer that is popular, now it's not popular at all, but it's the most popular because no one talks about it, but a little bit, is evacuation. After people die, unfortunately, well, they were doing maintenance of a nacelle, and they could not evacuate, and no one could suppress the fire, and this was very dramatic because it happened in front of everybody, they started to invest into emergency evacuation, which means systems that are in the nacelle, or they are carried by the workers, such that they can, in case of emergency, evacuate. The most popular one is ropes. Ropes that you immediately can attach to different parts of a nacelle and immediately go down, requires training. Or ladders that you can roll, so they don't take much space. I mean, remember, the tower inside is hollow, and it has a ladder. But if the smoke goes into a tower, then you cannot evacuate. Or there is one access into a nacelle, and you cannot access it. So to roll ladders are made of rope, for example. And obviously, there's people who thought, why don't we just jump from the top of the nacelle with a parachute? But that's extremely dangerous, so that has not been pursued. And they have even thought of, what about a helicopter trying to go and rescue them? That also was considered to be way too dangerous. Next to spinning, burning blades of a wind turbine. Extremely dangerous, but believe me that people thought about it. So now there is a little, you know what they did? It was very nice. There was a little paper on this. They started to calculate the evacuation time. It's like, you know, for engineers, yeah, that's what you do. You calculate the time it takes to evacuate, and you compare this to the time for untenable conditions in the exit route. Then you make sure that these are rays and that your people are faster than the fire and the smoke. That's not, that's fire engineering. Well, it took them a long time to start doing this. Good direction, Juan. Be positive. What about detection? Detection is a mystery to me because the wind turbines are full of sensors. It is a science craft, Boje. It has so many sensors, sometimes not even the experts know the sensors they have. They measure everything. Literally, name a sensor, they have it. None of them is being used for fire safety. That is one of the biggest mysteries I have with the people in the wind turbine industry. It's like you could use about 20 of these sensors for detecting fire. Obviously, it would not be straightforward. None of these sensors was developed to detect a fire. I understand. Some of them are measuring no light conditions inside the nacelle. Some of them are measuring temperature. Some of them are measuring vibrations that could lead to hotspot in the friction event. Some of them are looking into malfunction of the cables, which would indicate arching. These sensors would require some work to be converted into detection. But the sensor is already there. The capital, the investment, the signal, the monitoring, the storage, everything is already done. What about passive fire protection, separation and compartmentation, I think it's properly called. Super important. I mean, compartmentation is, you have such a, the Nacello is such a big place. It's a multi-story room without windows. You might have a fire because an ignition source has found a few, but you want is not to avoid the spread of the fire and the smoke. The smoke, because it might actually get technicians into trouble. And the fire itself, because it would lead to, instead of repairing the wind turbine, which is something relatively easy, you don't want to lose a whole wind turbine, and you don't want the wind turbine to produce secondary fires. So to avoid that is compartmentation. And if you find sharp boundaries between the parts that could get into a fire, and you just separate with fire resistance, that is something that engineers do all the time. But there's not that many to separate, to be honest, because it's like, on one hand, it's full of machinery, but it's fairly simple, because you're going to have the main power generating unit. You won't be able to split into multiple fire compartments. You're familiar with this. Fire engineers were invited, well, first, fire engineers are not invited to this design. But when they're invited, they're invited when everything has been set. So how is the fire engineer going to say, why don't we put a separation here? What, you mean a separation across the shaft of the turbine? No, we can't. So, obviously, if the industry wants to compartmentalize for fire safety, they need to do this from the beginning, to have this from the beginning in mind, not at the end. Fire engineers, we do amazing things, but we don't do magic. What else do we have left? Structural, but I guess it's not the damage would not be due to the tower falling down. That's not the best. Very rarely the tower collapses. So typically the tower stays put. Typically, not always. Sometimes it collapses. It collapses, it is a hazard to anything that is around. And also take into account that it collapses and it might still be on fire. And even the insides of the tower might be on fire. So you multiply the chances of a secondary fire when that happens. But the layer that receives least attention, although we published a paper on this, is the prevention layer, which is technical prevention. I'm not saying prevention don't play with matches. No one plays with matches in a wind turbine. Technical prevention is that the ignition source should not be strong enough to ignite the material that is nearby, which should not be too flammable. When there is an intersection between the power of the ignition source and the flammability of the material, then you have ignition. So you should have power sources that are not as powerful, and you separate them from the materials that are flammable, and the materials that are flammable should be at least a lot less flammable, and not as technical prevention. And you immediately, guess what, decrease the frequency of fires. And your super layer, the fire brigade, I guess that slice of the cheese is not on this board. The fire brigades very rarely suppresses turbine fires because lack of resources. I mean, no resources, lack of remit. Who has the fire brigade, which is mostly paid by taxpayer or the voluntary service to go up there to this strange machine that is up there. So I think the only thing we see in our data, the only thing we see is about 10%. So 90% of the fires are left. They burn. And what they do always, and they're really good at this, is they secure the perimeter. Okay. They avoid secondary fires or they try to avoid secondary, if they secure the perimeter, they avoid secondary fires, or they try to avoid secondary fires if they can. Yet, remember, 10% of the fires actually lead to secondary fires, even sometimes with the presence of the fire brigade, because it's a fire that might be burning there for many hours. Okay, we got all that is in there, all that can lead to a fire. We've just went through what you can do. And now, the reason why I wanted this episode, I mean, it's super funny. It's like fire engineering in a probe on a very isolated microorganism that you can totally play with, you know? Like, I wonder there must be a point at which investing in your fire safety starts to pay out. If you have a number on how many of those turbines burn down, one per 2,000, one per 10,000, if you know how much a turbine costs, and I would guess that you can scale the cost of the turbine per megawatts of power generation. And the same way you can scale up the production rate of a facility. So one megawatt turbine will create like a thousand more than a one kilowatt turbine, right? I wonder if there is a cutoff at which some of those points become a net gain for the investor. Like when do you start making money on fire protection on those turbines? When you will, over the life of your farm, earn more on your sprinklers than spend on putting them in place, right? So this is a very interesting conversation. In our first paper, we tried to have this conversation with numbers. But it didn't lead to a discussion with the industry. No one was interested in these numbers, probably because our numbers were wrong. No, we tried to look into cost of technology versus saving the investment. So I'm fine that they didn't like our numbers. Absolutely fine. I just thought they were going to have a conversation. The conversation is not happening. And I thought it is not happening because for them, and they own the data, this is not a clear case. For them, it's not clear that fly engineering is needed. I think they feel they can absorb the losses. But, I'm going to put two words into this. They thought they could absorb the losses until they realized that they could be having to pay for all the damage they produce around them. And many winter farms, the ones that are on land, and surrounded by forests, some of these forests are very large, some of them are very pretty. Some of them are very famous. Some of them have people inside. And that's when the wind-to-rain industry started to feel more uncomfortable about this. When they said, it's not about the cost of a cell. That happens one every 10,000, according to Guillermo, one every 2,000, according to someone else. Now is that we have to pay the liability of what we have started. That is what starts to make them happy to consider fire engineering. Not the nacelle as the extra nacelle, what is beyond the nacelle, which, you know, is considered to be a sustainability argument. When you design something, sustainability is to also look into what is you design something, sustainability is to also look into what is not that something, what is the outside in time and space. If someone is doing a wind turbine nacelle and is worried that it might burn the forest nearby, that is sustainability. They want the nacelle operation life to be sustainable. So that's a call for fire engineers to help sustainable energy sources. And the second comment that I wanted to make on this, when we published our paper in 2014, I was recently arrived to Imperial. So Imperial College is here in London, and London has more journalists per square meter than any other city in the world. So they were really interested in this paper. We got this paper covered in seven major and international newspapers. It was in Financial Times. It was in The Guardian. It was in, I mean, it was really busy that week talking to journalists all around the world. And to my surprise, what I discovered is the media immediately, immediately, even before reading the paper, split in two. There was no intermediate. They either love the paper because they didn't like wind turbines and they were covering it because they love it, or they dislike the paper immediately, even before reading it, because it was destroying or it was damaging the wind turbine environment. And then suddenly the same paper was used in two different camps, the one that loved it and the one that hated it. The one that loved it is because they were against wind turbines, and the one that hated it was because they loved wind turbines. And me in the middle. And they got me into serious trouble with actually Imperial College, because the journalists, when they're very intense on these things and they wanted to find holes in our research, they sometimes they don't stop because they are being paid for this. Pretty sure at some point I've asked Ricky to cover wind turbines and he said he's not going through that again. That week was hell. OK. That week was hell. And then I thought, you know, obviously I went through the week and then i thought well you know if we steal the pods it will be for the good and now we are here 10 years later the bot did not move there was no experience and then i thought okay this is now unfair because the industry pushed so hard shield by some of the journalists they push so hard and they did not deliver into the hopes that we had, that they were going to be releasing the data, that they themselves were going to lead this problem. I would still consider a simplified version without even taking the surroundings. It's a really clever exercise to showcase, like you said, the textbook example of calculating the value of fire safety. And I think it could become a very nice staple fire safety engineering course example for students. If you do that... Calculate the point at which it makes sense. Yeah, I know. It's true. And especially because the turbine is growing in size, that maybe your suppression can stay local to one space. For example, when they're doing that drive, which means they're removing the gearboxes, you remove the gearboxes, you remove one ignition source, which is the mechanical hot splint. And a ton of oil. It means that now if you put suppression, you can put suppression in the electrical generator. So you can actually have a local suppression that is not just taking care of the whole nacelle, but just when you're reducing the cost of suppression. And as the wind turbine grows in size, it grows in money, you want to protect an asset that is more valuable, I agree with you. There's going to be a point where now it's worth to protect it, even with low frequency fires. And there is even now standards on how to test for suppression systems inside the cells. This is why I tell you that it's the most popular of the suppression of the protection layers, because the one that was jumped into the first. But it's not the one that I'm fascinated by progress either. So it's not that I'm happy about that layer being successful. I'm not even happy about that layer. It's the most developed. Okay, we've covered it. Let's step, for the end of the interview, let's step a step back. It's also an illustration of battling against new solutions and sustainability, introducing new technologies without taking fire safety into consideration. Do you think, I mean, technologies that are meant to relieve the carbon costs or create green energy, whatever green means, are popping every now and then. What can we learn from the wind turbine industry example? As engineers, unfortunately, because there is secrecy, we cannot learn much. What we can learn is what not to do, which is when you have a hazard, don't hide it. If it's true that it's not a hazard, if it's true that it's not a risk because the probability is low, make sure that you show everybody, not just your clients, that that's the case. Because what we have in this field, in this topic, we have not many lessons to learn. We have lessons to avoid. I would love to tell you that the industry got into this. They had committees. And the committees decided that the best thing was to reduce the amount of material X and displace material Y and introduce a detection Z and to... No, I cannot tell you that. What I can tell you is there was an incredible amount of denial. Many meetings that I had to travel to some of these, coming back thinking, why did I waste literally two days of my life for this? And then I monitor the literature and the literature, there is no breakthrough in the technical literature. Every single time that someone repeats the work that we did in 2014, they keep seeing very similar percentage, very similar. The sources are the same. I mean, literally, they still rely on the same sources that we rely on in 2014. I mean, it is time for having new sources of data. This will be one of the first Firesense show episodes when I can just list the entire literature on the topic in the show notes. It's like two papers from you and one from Elalia Plana's team. And we say, yeah, they did the suppression one. I see a CFD one from them. Yeah. So not many lessons to learn, but do you see similar challenges growing within other branches of sustainability in which the fire safety engineers are not a part of the discussion? And perhaps they should. Yeah, of course. I mean, in engineering, it is not unusual that there is a new technology, innovation. We love it. And then we discover later on, it's always later on, we discover that this new technology, this innovation also brings a new hazard. And obviously, it's very important for engineers to understand what is this new hazard, because then it needs to be addressed or removed. If we do not understand the hazard, by then it needs to be addressed or removed. If we do not understand the hazard, by definition, it cannot be addressed, at least not meaningfully, and it cannot be removed, at least meaningfully. So every new hazard requires thinking. And we in fire engineering, we see this happening left and right, and we are always behind. Lithium-ion batteries, facades, you work on green walls, solar power, wind turbines today, every single innovation, unfortunately, in the 21st century, typically comes with a new hazard related to fire. Some of them have low intensity, low risk, low consequences, low frequency. We can discuss this. Some of them not. Some of them happen often. Some of them are high consequences. Some of them not. Some of them happen often. Some of them are high consequences. Some of them are very different to address. Lithium ion batteries being the most difficult to address because it is not even the chemistry, the traditional chemistry of hydrocarbon fires. And this is what we keep our profession, you know, always standing, always paying attention and unfortunately always catching up. And do you have any ideas how to put fire engineers in front of that, inside the problem, instead of having an industry that isolates itself from the fire science? I mean, I'm personally offended because it seems like fire science is a hazard to them, whereas we're supposed to help them, right? This is a case literally where you see that in print. We're talking about turbines maybe catching fires. And if you read the paper, we're actually saying one in 10,000 is not a hazard. We even said that. Especially if you compare it to, for example, the oil industry, which has a fire literally every 10 minutes. We were saying you have one every 12 weeks, right? This is not a hazard compared to your competitors. Still, people thought far scientists are bringing trouble to my community, to my industry. And instead of saying, talk to them, embrace them, resolve the problem. No. Instead of that, they say, send the journalists and bark at them so they become quiet. So they saw us as troublemakers, as opposed to wanting them to help. Instead of good hackers that want to help them, they thought we were the bad hackers that were there to cause harm. I see the very same case with electric vehicles and with human batteries in general and many, many of the sustainability technologies. I think that's one of the challenges of the modern fire safety engineering to actually be there. Like, you know, be present at the table, hopefully from the beginning, from the earliest phases where you can actually influence the decisions and not just appear after a fire has happened to help me out with the thousands of the same objects I've just built, you know, it could happen again. Indeed. And awareness, Bolle, it requires awareness. That's what it requires. Awareness by engineers, awareness by authorities, awareness by citizens. You know, and you know this very well, and your audience probably will know this, but it's always worth remembering. When fire engineering succeeds, and it has a beautiful, successful story over the last hundred years, no one knows we exist. I always say I'm Guillermo Reym, I'm a member of a secret society. The audience is not meant to know that we exist. Because when they learn that we exist, it's because fires are happening and we are not doing our job. We do our job, fires appear, society thinks we are a secret membership. And on that secret accent, let's finish the winter discussion. I hope I don't get buried by lawyers and journalists. I just send them out to you. You have a very good press team at Imperial. I've had enough of them. Let's see if we wake them up after 10 years. Thank you very much, Guillermo, for coming to the Fire Science Show. And let's hope the next one is sooner than 100 episodes from now. Yeah, no, but yeah, it's true. I look forward. I will think of more topics. And let's see if I can convince you of another one. And that's it. Wind turbines on fire, a microcosm of fire science and engineering. I truly stand by saying it's something we could make a stable risk-based design example for teaching how to do fire safety engineering. Something in which you can put a really good number on the value of fire safety. As sharp and clear as in not many other applications out there. I really enjoy this and I think it could be a very nice exercise for anyone to do, actually. Try to calculate at which size of wind turbine, at which energy generation. Just start to get money back out of putting fire safety solutions inside, and when they do not make sense, when they are just a simple cost. It's a really interesting approach. Of course, there's complications to that, as what Guillermo said. When the wind turbine fires start to create damage outside, for which you are liable for, that's a different story. But in this very simplistic way, I think it's a nice, nice way to teach fire safety. So, that's it for the wind turbine episode. Of course, there was much more into the episode on how the devices burn, how they act in fires, what can we do to prevent that, and how can we respond to those, but I won't repeat myself. It's episode 150, so instead let me give a round of thank yous all around the table. First, thanks to Guillermo for being the first guest in the podcast, being the guest in episode 50, now being the guest in episode 150, and some more episodes as well. So big thanks to you, Guillermo, for supporting the mission of The Fire Science Show. Second big shout out goes to OFAR Consultants. We're together for more than 70 episodes already, and this is a beautiful collaboration. They are supportive to my mission. They truly believe in what I'm doing in here and help me deliver great content to you every week. And finally, big thanks to you, the listener. I do it all for you. I craft new episodes thinking about what you would like to hear. I respond to what you tell me, and I try to get guests who will be the most interesting for you. Bye.
