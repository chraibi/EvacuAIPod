 Hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show episode 49. Great to have you here again. Over the time I have noticed that there are some subjects in the podcast that generate above the usual interest in my audience. And among these topics there's definitely battery fires. I think lithium ion battery is something that touches all of us as engineers because it's something new and it's something that everyone expects us to handle in a way. Even if in your scientific or engineering career you don't necessarily touch the topic, eventually you will be asked about the questions of burning electrical vehicles or is energy storage at your house safe or not. And I think we should be ready to answer these questions, hopefully, based on science and evidence. And this is what I'm trying to get you in the podcast and also get for myself in the podcast by inviting world-class experts. We had Roland Bichon from RISE who discussed electric vehicles. We had D.K. Izakoye who discussed the battery systems. And today another great scientist, this time a young talent from King's College, Dr. Francesco Restuccia, who also happens to be my good friend and whom I admire a lot because his scientific scrutiny and the way how he performs research is on another level. All the effort he puts into quantifying uncertainties, understanding the first principles in experiments he's doing, the way how he designs, ah, this is so good. And you will hear that in the podcast that he's really good and he knows what he's talking about, even though every second sentence he claims he's not an expert. He certainly is. And with Francesco, we go deep inside the cell, the battery, to understand what makes battery dangerous. Why batteries burn, what events lead to a cascading failure of battery, and a little more about if self-heating can be an issue in batteries. And that's very interesting. Francesco is a scientist who made a career out of investigating self-heating. And I find it really great that he applied all this knowledge he gained on self-heating of various materials to batteries now. And that looks very, very promising. So it's a tough episode, but I think if we want to be prepared to deal with batteries, to talk about batteries, to provide safety, to facilities that deal with batteries, we need to understand what happens inside the battery. And this episode is all about it. I hope you will enjoy it. And one more question to ask, if you do enjoy and if you'd like the podcast, maybe there's a chance you could leave a five-star review in your podcast app. That would help me a lot with my search engine optimization. The algorithms love five stars. So if possible, and you can just pause for a second, jump into the review part of your podcast app and leave something nicer. I would be very grateful for that. And once you're done with that, please press play and enjoy the episode. Let's go. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, I'm today here with Dr. Francesco Rustuccia of King's College in London. Hey Francesco. Hi Wojciech. Thank you for having me. Welcome, welcome, man. Happy to have you here. And another take on batteries today. The previous episodes about batteries were really well received, so I assume the audience in the podcast is very interested in this technology and who's not in the world of fire, who are being scared about the dangers of lithium-ion batteries every day. And last week I had Mike Spearpoint on the show, and he also brought numerous things to consider, not to worry about, but to consider when doing a car park with these electric vehicles. Actually, Mike said that the first vehicles were electric. That killed me. First car parks were meant for electric cars. Now to think about that, we have run a full circle. But Francesco, I didn't ask you to talk about electric cars. We can discuss the vehicles on some other day. I want some hardcore chemistry, man. I want to finally know what the hell sits in the battery that makes it so scary to everyone around. And I've learned that I should not poke one with a nail to see what's inside. Accurate, yes. The active material inside might not like it. So, yeah, please tell me what kind of devil's technology lies inside the lithium-ion cell. And, yeah, let's start with the basics. Like, how is a goddamn battery built? I know it from outside. So, I'm not a chemist, so any chemist might be horrified at my explanation because I will simplify it. But effectively, you have lithium-ion batteries, and they're named after the active material that's inside. So for example, when you read lithium cobalt oxide and you read L-I-C-O-O-2 or L-C-O, that just means that the active material is lithium cobalt. So the material that the cathode is made of is lithium cobalt. Or the other popular one is LMO, so lithium manganese oxide. And again, it just means that the active material, so the cathode, is made up of lithium manganese in layers. So they have an oxide layer. And the third common one is NMC. So the three that you usually read most about since you mentioned vehicles is NMC, which is basically a cathode combination of nickel manganese cobalt. And so they're usually used for power cells. So that's why they're used a lot in electric vehicles, because, for example,, start with the 18650 cell, and that's just a cell that can deliver, I don't know, about 2,000 to 3,000 milliampere hours, so 4 to 5 amps. I have a flashlight with just one cell, and it lights for 12 hours. So for me, that's 12 hours of continuous light capacity in such a cell. Yeah, and then they can charge. So they have this specific energy, right? It could be, for example, NMC is between 150 to 200 watt hour per kilo. So quite high energy dense, right? It's very, very big. Or the lithium manganese oxide one, which is less powerful one, right? There's a hundred still, right? It's a hundred watt hours per kilogram. So these have quite a lot of energy that can be stored into them. Okay. But that's the cathode. What's else in there? So you have the anode and the electrolyte. And in fact, that's where the fire comes in. So these batteries are made up of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte substance inside. And These batteries are made up of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte substance inside. And the electrolyte substance varies. And in fact, it's usually quite hard to find out what the electrolyte is when writing papers. Again, I am not a chemist. So when I started looking into this, I was a bit confused at what the electrolyte was. So I asked a chemist, I asked a chemical engineer, what is the electrolyte? And they said it's full of additives. It's really complicated. It varies battery from battery. But you always know what the cathode is because that's what the battery is named after. And that's what really is what provides the energy density component. So let's agree on calling electrolyte the battery juice. Exactly, yes. So you have the juice, you have the anode, and you have the cathode. And for a fire problem, why are we interested in these materials? So these are the materials within a battery. When you cycle a battery, so you connect it up, you make it active, then electrodes flow, right? So you have your electrical cycle, and part of the energy that's released is your electrical energy, and part of it is what's known as dual heating, right? So it's just the electrical, the cell impedance. Your cell has some resistance, and it releases some heat and dual heating. One second. One step back. Yes. But the way how it is built, I was actually quite confused when I watched the video of batteries being produced, because when I was a young kid, I had a passion for chemistry and blowing stuff up and actually setting things on fire, which has not changed significantly. I was about to say, now you basically just do that for a living. I made it into living, so actually that's quite cool. And I don't go to jail for that. That's another benefit. But I've played with batteries. By playing, I mean I've disassembled them, and there was like a graphite core, there was a metal encasing, and there was a black, oddly smelling substance in it. And when I then saw 30 years fast forward, how batteries made, they were like sheets of materials spinned into a cylinder. So it's like a continuous sandwich that's just rolled. Yeah, so's just rolled. Yeah. So for the cylindrical batteries, you start with the powder, right? So you start with some material. You then make really, really, really thin sheets. And then you roll them up into jelly rolls. So you roll them up into all these really thin sheets into a droll. Then you compress it into a can of metal so that it's protected. And then you basically put a lid on the top, which has the plus bit so that you can connect a wire to it. And on the bottom, you put an anode. So you put the cap on the anode. Only when I saw this, how it is made, and only when I finally understood what is inside, because I had this image in my head from the childhood that it's like a rod of something in the middle, a substance and then casing that surrounds it. Only when I realized it's layers of cathodes and anodes, all like jelly rolls together in one continuous roll, I've realized that why this mechanical failure of batteries, like why crushing it or why nailing it immediately creates such an effect because essentially you're suddenly connecting the things that should be separated. You create a short circuit between the cathodes and anodes. And because they are so close together, because you probably want to have the biggest surface reacting all the time. So there's like dozens or hundreds of these layers together. You pierce through them completely and suddenly you've created hundreds of short circuits. And you just pointed out the item that I missed, obviously, in the rolling. You put a really, really thin membrane, which is called the separator, that separates the two, right? So, it almost looks like a sheet of paper, right? And then you fill it with the liquid electrolyte, or the juice, as we called it, and then you put the cap, yeah. So, Dan, when these short circuits, it's just all the energy that's stored in the battery and and we try to put as much energy in it because of obvious reasons, it's just released in a split of a second, actually. And that's really interesting. But I didn't want to talk that much about mechanical failure of batteries because you also happen to be quite a knowledgeable person about self-heating processes. And this is something I look forward. So you've started mentioning why the battery produces heat. Maybe you can finish that thought. Can I add one thing just out of curiosity? Yeah, go on. You actually sparked my curiosity. You know that the battery manufacturing, from what I hear from the manufacturing people, the battery manufacturing process is done a certain way because it was adapted from existing industries, right? So when we used to do Kodak films, right, we already had the industry for that, which is why the film making, from what I understand from the material scientists, the process was just an adaption of the one from the film industry, like Kodak and so on. And that's why it was done that way. Because from an engineering point of view, I always thought there must be a more optimal way to do it, but they already had the industry. So they just adapted an existing industry. But again, I'm not a material scientist, so this is from my manufacturing colleagues, because I asked why. From an engineering perspective, there must be a more efficient way to make this. And that's also why now they're always looking at future batteries and there are other materials that they're trying to think about. But yeah. But there were also prismatic cells, poach cells, and I guess these are done in a slightly different way, I would guess. Okay, so you started mentioning why the battery heats up. It's meant to produce electricity, but it also, because it has a resistance, it's not a superconductor, it must produce heat at the same time. So first, what are the rates? How much battery heats and how much it gives back electricity? Oh, so, the vast majority is electricity. So, the extreme case is the one you pointed out earlier, which is when you start having short circuits, right? Because if you start having short circuits, then you increase that resistance of your battery massively. Or if your battery starts degrading, then that impedance, internal impedance, increases. The higher the internal impedance, internal impedance increases. The higher the internal impedance, the more dual heating you produce. So, you know, a fresh battery, new, with no degradation, with no short circuits, probably, I would guess, 99% electricity, 1% heat, or maybe 2%. Very, very small amount of it is heat. But the more your battery degrades, the more internal impedance you create. And so the higher the heat. But the more your battery degrades, the more internal impedance you create. And so the higher the heat. And so actually, it's not a constant. It depends on your battery's aging, how much it produces. And it depends on the most extreme cases when you start creating a short circuit, because then that short circuit creates a peak of impedance, right? And so then a large portion of your energy stored becomes released in heat rather than electricity and that's a time issue as well because we do heat transfer for fire right so heat transfer is a time dependent process and so if your heat is released very slowly over a long period of time you go into my other area of expertise self-heating if your heat is released very very quickly then you have a local peak of temperature increase and then the rates, chemistry rates are exponential and so they go up much, much faster. But even if it's 1% and let's assume your car driving takes, I don't know, 30 kilowatts, 50 kilowatts, 100 kilowatts if you enjoy your life and quick cars. But it takes, let's say, 50 kilowatts per hour. And even if it's just 1%, that's 500 watts released into a metal tank. And even more important than the charging, right? So we always talk about fast charging. If you use all of your battery in two hours driving, but then you want to charge it in 10 minutes, you're doing the exact same electrical cycle backwards, right? So instead of the energy going one way, it's going the other, but you're still producing heat. The heat generation, the dual heating is still based on that impedance. But if you want to, that's the biggest problem they have with fast charging, right? Is if you want to charge your electric vehicle in five minutes, which is impossible at the moment, but imagine you did. The amount of heat that you will be producing is massive because the kilowatts that you're putting in are huge. And so the charging rate and the discharging rate, so you're using up of your vehicle electricity, higher discharge rate means higher C number is what they call it in the battery world, would mean more heat produced per unit time. Yeah, I was always surprised when I saw this information about quick chargers and people trying to connect like, I don't know, half megawatt charger into a truck. And I'm like, I run the fire laboratory. We do run high capacity fans in high temperatures. When I have to test a 100-kilowatt fan, it adds so much to my logistics because it's like huge, huge cords. It's dangerous. That's a lot of electricity, man. And then you just go, yeah, and I will just plug this half-megawatt socket into my car and go for a coffee. That scares the hell out of me, but I guess I hope they've worked it over. But again, if it's just 1% that goes into heat, that's a considerable amount of heat. And I've had this issue when designing my lab. So when I was designing my lab, I wanted to have scalability for my battery testing, so I have a nice big battery tester. But the first question I got from the health and safety team as, you know, the crazy academic who wants to put something in is how much heat will you be generating? Because this says you've asked us to put in a current limiter of 60 amps. 60 amps is very high. So how much heat are you going to be producing? So I had to do some back of the envelope calculations, not with 1% heat, but I went with 10% just to maximize. But yeah, it is a huge concern. From a research side in the lab, I can imagine from a design side when you're building the cars or building the charging stations, just as big, right? Because you have more people using it, you have more chance of error, you have more risk of a failure. more chance of error, you have more risk of a failure. Okay, so before we go into the battery finally igniting, we've discussed the heating processes due to short circuits with mechanical failure. We've briefly discussed the charging and just energy consumption. And let's go into self-heating. I guess if I can take a step back in between the two, I can explain the stages maybe of the heating that might help. So in a battery, you have reactions happening at different temperatures and you're going to get to self-heating, which I'm happy to talk about. But I guess maybe it's when your battery, it doesn't matter how your battery is heating up, right? Self-heating or not self-heating. When your battery reaches a certain level of temperature and it cannot dissipate the heat. Usually that's about 100 degrees. When you get to 100 degrees, your solid electrolyte interface, so that's the thin layer that is on your cathode, it starts to decompose, right? And so if that starts to decompose, that causes exothermic reactions and that adds its own heat. So, you know, we say it's an active material. And as an active material, when I think of chemistry, the reaction rates from a combustion side always happen. Exothermic reactions always happen at different temperature ranges, right? And so in the battery, usually you first have heat being created from the solid electrolyte interface decomposing, then from the electrode electrolyte interface decomposing, then from the electrode decomposition at a higher temperature, and then from the electrolyte decomposition at the higher even temperature. And so you have the inner materials, those active materials you were asking about, all start reacting at different temperatures. Okay, so can we just remove the one that reacts at the lowest temperature? But you need it to. You need. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what causes the battery to work. Can we make a magic material that will go off at 200, not at 100? The SEI layer, so the solid electrolyte decomposition layer, is just like a passivating layer that forms on the electrodes. And so as your battery operates, you're forming this layer. And so it's kind of covering the intercalated lithium in the negative electrode. And so when it starts decomposing, then the intercalated lithium is exposed, right? And so it's then exposed to the electrolyte and so it causes even more reactions. So basically you enter a path of no return, and this additional heat generated by this exothermic reaction will heat the thing more. Yeah, much, much more. Up to a next point where another thing will start contributing, and another thing, and another thing, and you end up with this thermal runaway, I guess. This is it, yeah? And actually the last material, ironically, which is maybe slightly contrary, we name all the batteries from the active materials, right? So I said, but that's usually the last material that then starts, because that is the one at the most high temperature. So that's actually the last bit that starts creating heat, usually, because normally at the higher, higher temperatures, then the positive electrode can start becoming unstable and decompose. Let's say that all the heat released in a fire of a single cell is 100%. Do we know how much each of these steps contributes to this? Complicated. So it depends on the state of charge of the battery. So it depends also how much energy is in the battery. So it depends also how much energy is in the battery. And it depends on what electrolyte is being used. So there are some papers that have looked at the different contributions. And from a self-feeding side, we have looked at the contribution in temperature rates of the different rates of increase, but not the individual materials. So we looked at the temperature range. Okay, so from this temperature to this, is this increase? Yeah. Okay. So at the macro level rather than at the chemistry level. At the chemistry level, it's quite a challenge. So because you start having, so the materials that react start forming other materials. And in fact, if your cell then overpressures, for example, you were talking about prismatic cells earlier. So if your prismatic cell bursts the safety vent, and then some of these gases that are being produced inside start reacting with the oxygen outside, then that causes even more reactions. And the gases that are being produced are very complicated. So there are a lot of carbohydrates, but there's also hydrochloric gases, hydrofluoric. And so it can get very complicated very quickly. But I guess this is fundamental to understand these macro fires of batteries. Because they start, like the ones that are from the individual cells. Because obviously if the car park is on fire and your battery catches fire from that heat, I guess the cell chemistry would not matter that much. It just acts as a heat source, right? It's just a heat source, exactly. It's the same with our pool fires, right? If you have a pool fire, once your pool fire has a size, it's the heat release rate from that size. It doesn't matter if you were burning C7 or C8, right? It's the heat that's being released from those flames, the heat release rate. Okay. But you asked me earlier about modifying the items inside. You're not far off. I actually think that is one of the solutions. If you can change the additives in the electrolytes to add things that maybe passively act for the duration of your battery life but then if your temperature is above a certain temperature they act as a suppressant or the heat remover or whatever it is that could be a solution um or you know if you can have maybe a ceramic coated separator in between, right? Then the ceramic is harder to create short circuits from, right? It's also harder to roll, Oswald. Yes, exactly. It adds a cost and it adds a weight, and weight is a big problem. But yeah, that could be one way. So it can start from the chemistry modification. So you can change the cathode, you can change the anode, you can change the additives and the electrolytes, or as we are not chemists, neither myself nor you, we can look at the bigger size, right? So we can look at a bigger size. What can we do with a battery management system? Or what can we do with separation, right? Separation between batteries within a pack. What can we do with detection? What can we do with different suppression methods? I think it's a brilliant starting point. I'm on the edge of understanding. I understand literally up to 60% of what you said and I think I'm quite successful but the takeaway is I think it's this thought that things happen at certain temperatures and essentially you reach a threshold point which initiates a set of events that lead to failure. And I think this is a great takeaway because it doesn't happen by pure magic or unicorn farts. It's chemistry that leads to that, And you've already mentioned many things that influence this thing, the energy capacity of the battery, the charging state of the battery, the processes, is it charging, is it discharging, the chemistry of the electrolyte. Because I think this is where the confidential magic is happening. If everyone is using the same cathode materials, I guess they're playing with electrolytes to differentiate and patent some things to earn more coin on that. And finally, maybe not exactly, but you have a rough idea when this thing becomes dangerous. Because if you don't enter this cascading level or this cascade of events leading to a major failure, you don't get a major failure. Yes. And we've talked very generally, right? So it can also be, I've talked about the system in charger, discharger in use, but also passive, right? That's where self-heating comes in when you mentioned self-heating is, you know, what's an active circuit. So I said in the charging and discharging rates, but batteries still react. You know I said in the charging and discharging rates, but batteries still react. Your battery is always reacting when it's not connected. It's still producing heat, even in open circuit conditions. There was a game abroad on Twitter, some instruction for a laptop, which mentioned fire in so many places. And I've responded showing a picture of my old laptop that two years ago, my battery has suddenly swollen into like three times its size. And I recall it happened literally overnight. I didn't use the laptop. So when the device is idle, I guess there are still things happening in there. Yeah, because mass diffusion, right? You know, you're always going to have some electrodes travel through. You're always going to have diffusion through your, from one side to the other. So your battery will always, even when it's not connected, your internal resistance is in itself a connection, right? So you're going to have passive resistance, not just active resistance. Okay, but will it happen when the battery is discharged? Like when its charge level is zero? When charge level is zero, you don't get to that condition because that's really bad. So when everything is on one end, you're basically going to have exposed the material. So remember I said that you're creating this SEI layer. If you've moved everything to one end, so the battery is completely at zero, you will have exposed that and it's not designed to be exposed. So you're telling... In fact, I think it starts reacting even further. So you're telling me my laptop is lying to me when it says charge zero? Absolutely, yeah. There is no such... I always knew that. You will never allow a device to go down to zero. Okay, but what does that mean? Okay, that's cool. I have a laptop with one battery, but on the factory where they produce laptop batteries, they probably have one million of them stuck together. What does this mean for storage of batteries? When you produce them in large volume quantities, you have tons of devices that, and you just said that the reactions are ongoing, whether you like it or not. So they are produced and often they are shipped as charged batteries. And that's why they put a limit. So you have an ideal charge rate, which is, I think, 30% from the standards now, but also colder temperatures. So that's the other thing you do is you reduce this self-discharge, right? You lower the temperature. So what do I do when I store batteries in my lab is they have to be in a fridge below 10 degrees, ideally 10 degrees, and then that's the optimal range for them not to reduce the self-discharge. So self-discharge is also temperature dependent. Okay, but a stupid question. If my cell phone in winter works shorter and if I expose it to minus 20, it's going to die very soon. So it loses this capability of react, which also, from your perspective, makes it safer. Well, so other problems arise when you go to too low. Other problems arise. So I'm not a material scientist or a chemist, but you have a sweet spot of temperatures for which the materials are designed. If you go too low in temperature, I believe you might start degrading the materials in other ways, but I'm not an expert on this. So there is a guidance on the range you want to keep it in for the battery to be healthy, and I don't know what that lower limit is. That doesn't matter. But it exists. That's what matters. Yes. So based on experience, tests, and knowledge, the scientists have figured out the optimal charge level where, let's say, the risk would be minimum. Okay. Charge and temperature. Charge and temperature, right? So I think charge, they shipped them at 30% state of charge. And temperature, I don't know, but there is an optimal temperature, which is usually your battery. The optimal temperature for a battery normally is between 10 and 25 degrees. Above 25 degrees, it's not good for the battery. Below 10 degrees, might start having other issues. But for example, when I store them in the lab, it's between 6 and 10 degrees. Okay, so batteries produce heat. There's an optimal temperature at which the, let's call it risk being lowest. Maybe it's incorrect term, but more understandable by the FHIR audience. So are we managing this heat? That's something that interests me. So if I have a bunch of batteries in my car, which I don't because I don't have electric vehicle yet, but in my hypothetical car, if I had it, would the battery management system be monitoring the heat as well? Because I know it is monitoring the electricity. Good question. So your battery in an electric vehicle is made up of many, many cells, thousands of cells. You, for a question of cost and space, you don't monitor every single cell's temperature. Voltage you can do by line because you can have a row. And if it's in series, you have the voltage there, right? And voltage you probably would like to monitor to know the charge level anyway. Correct. And you usually do that by row. So, every 6 or 12 usually do that by row. So every six or 12 or whatever that row is. But temperature, you cannot do for each one just because it adds massive costs. And so temperature sometimes is monitored, but it would be monitored at probably a pack level, not a cell level. But everything I've been telling you now is about a single cell. So imagine you have a cell that starts deteriorating or a cell that goes into some kind of initial failure condition. Usually in an electric vehicle, you're not monitoring that cell's temperature. And some people say that, OK, but you're monitoring the voltage, so you will see a voltage drop. But sometimes, and we've shown this in literature, including a paper I am on, we've shown that sometimes the failure happens before the voltage drops. So in fact, I have a case in one of the papers we've written that the battery was basically on fire and the voltage was still constant, and then it dropped 15 seconds later. Very brave battery. I assume it was Ukrainian fighting till the end. Any other things you can monitor? Like maybe you can measure impedance of the cells. Yeah, so impedance is another thing they do. And they measure impedance, especially when they're trying to figure out how your battery has degraded. So imagine you want to have a second life of a battery. So the elephant in the room for batteries, in my opinion, is recycling, right? Just like we had for plastics. When your car or whatever system you're using reaches its end of life, you either recycle the battery, and that has a lot of costs involved, or you try to redeploy it in the second life in something that requires maybe less high spec, right? Because your battery has degraded. So how do you then figure out how much your battery has degraded? So normally what they do is they then measure the impedance of the battery. So you can use impedance systems that measure what the new internal impedance is so that you know how much your battery has degraded. What it doesn't tell you is what conditions it was exposed to. It doesn't tell you if it was kept in a warehouse at 40 degrees. So it doesn't tell you what has degraded. But yeah, battery recycling, entire topic. But for me, apart from the fire safety, which I find really interesting, and a global scale is what's the plan with end of life for the batteries. We have it for nuclear, right? If you have a nuclear power plant, you want to design a nuclear power plant, you are not allowed until you have presented the plan of what happens to all the spent fuel, what happens to the land, what happens to everything that goes with that, right? Even if you want to put a new oil rig out into the sea, you have to have an end-of-life plan for that platform and what happens. But with batteries, there's not much. People who are listening to the podcast are open-minded fire engineers who want to understand what the future brings. And I think what you mentioned now, if we think we have an issue with electric vehicles or lithium-ion batteries today, which I don't think is that big issue, but let's say the public would say it's a big issue today. Like when you bring to the question the out-of-life batteries or repurposed batteries or 30-year-old batteries, that's going to be an interesting issue we are going to have. And we better start looking for solutions how to manage this. Should we incrementally increase the fire safety regulations for the batteries, even though we don't have really good regulations at the moment. But it seems that we're struggling with something that's not even a problem yet. Yes, and I think it's going to become a problem in a couple of years, right? Once batteries are scaling up and scaling up, and we're using more and more high energy density batteries. Once people and there are companies that have started doing second life of batteries, what are the regulations around that from a safety side? If I'm a fire scientist and I care about when the system will fail and potentially cause a fire and I have no clue of what's changed inside, I just have this battery pack and I've been told the impedance has changed and that's it and I have no clue of what's changed inside. I just have this battery pack and I've been told the impedance has changed and that's it. I have no clue what I've exposed it to. The hysteresis of it, what cycling it's been exposed to, what charging it's been exposed to, that degrades the battery. So it's from a safety side, I find it concerning. And how degraded battery is more dangerous because of this increased impedance, this increased self-heating? Yeah, potential short circuits, right? So, for example, self-heating, right? So, sorry, I'm going to step into self-heating. Go on to self-heating, yeah. So, Schwanzer, Zenwin, and Guillermo Reyn and I have worked on self-heating at Imperial. Schwanz and Zenwin and Guillermo Reyn and I have worked on self-heating at Imperial. And a lot of what I'm going to say is the merit of Zenwin and Schwanz's work and their PhDs. And, you know, they studied a lot on what happens when you have... These exosomal chemical reactions are always happening, right? So they increase your temperature. So I care about self-heating ignition. I've done self-heating ignition for non-batteries, for other reactive media in my PhD. And the problem is very easily posed to me is, well, the behavior is the same. So what happens if in an open circuit cell, instead of abusing it, instead of adding an internal short circuit, I just consider the battery itself and the heating that it's caused. If the heat cannot be dissipated and the heat starts building up, then I might reach a critical temperature for which self-heating ignition can happen and thermal runaway can happen, right? So I can reach a condition where these exothermic chemical reactions are causing enough heat to be produced that the environment around it is not providing enough cooling. And so eventually the temperature will go up. And obviously, if that's a single cell, you do the calculations and Schwantze has done experimentally and you get a ridiculous high temperature that you will not reach in a warehouse. But if you increase the size, so with self-heating theory, if you go back to Seminoff or if you go back to the work in the 80s or even some of my work in my PhD, you see that for most reactive media, if you increase the size, the temperature threshold for which you will reach a critical temperature that will eventually lead to thermal runaway will decrease. And so by how much it decreases, it changes. And so what they did in their PhD was they looked at this phenomenon for batteries. So they said, okay, if I have a stack of batteries and those batteries are all heating up, the center core battery might be heating up more, right? Because it's not releasing that heat to the environment. It's releasing it to batteries next to it, which are also causing heat, right? And eventually you might reach the condition where you have temperatures that cause ignition, temperatures that you can reach in warehouses. The state of batteries is idle. They are not being charged. Yeah, they're open circuit. So imagine you have a warehouse. Right. So Zen Wen did this calculation in his PhD, which was that he took the size of a warehouse and he said, okay, imagine I'm packaging batteries in this warehouse and it's all batteries. At what size will I need a number of batteries for them to ignite at room temperature in the warehouse? And he found the number to be very, very high, you know, racks and racks of them. But that's if there is no insulation, there is no packaging. And so he said, okay, now what happens if I start adding packaging, right? So packaging causes insulation, in fact. So it lets you retain the heat. And he saw that that temperature started dropping massively. And one of his papers found effectively that depending on what insulation you have between the batteries, it actually massively lowers the temperature for which self-heating ignition happens. And Schwanzer then did this experimentally. So he measured self-heating ignition for a stack of batteries. And he saw that as you increase the stack size, the temperature for which they reached ignition reduced. And that is passive self-heating that you would encounter when you store the batteries. Yes. You've said that there was a certain charging point at which they should be stored. So did you guys try different charging points? Yes, absolutely. Very good question. So that was one of our first questions. Okay, we did everything at a single charging point initially. So in Schwanz's first experiments that he did back in China, he had state of charge of 30%. So he had the low one that you use for transport. But then he said, okay, but what happens if I increase it, right? So what happens if I go to higher state of charge? And in fact, he found that you have more electrical energy stored inside, but he also found that your temperature threshold for self-heating ignition massively reduces. And so the more state of charge, the lower critical temperature for which ignition is triggered. By ignition, you mean the beginning of these cascading processes or something specific? Yes, so basically where the process becomes unstoppable, right? Yes. So the beginning. So basically where the process becomes unstoppable. Right. And at some point. Yeah. What what is that trigger temperature? So if I go back to something that we've looked at in fire from the 1980s is coal. Right. So this was done a lot for coal fires is, you know, what is that temperature for storage. So coal has the same problem, right? Coal is a reactive material. It oxidizes with oxygen. So if there's oxygen in the room, your coal is going to be producing its own heat. It doesn't matter that you're not burning it. It's going to be producing heat. And so the mines that use coal or power plants that use coal always have that policy of first in, first out, right? The coal that gets into storage first is the first one that's going to be used. You don't leave it in storage for a long time. You don't start using the one that comes later. Not because of aging of coal and whiskey. The aged are better. It's the opposite. The more aging it has, the more heat it's had a chance to produce. And so for coal, they found obviously that the bigger the storage pile, the lower the temperature for which you would have that trigger. And so that's what we were looking at from a battery side, is can we find a similar behavior to what we have seen in many, many fuels over the history in fire science, and which maybe the battery community was not really used to thinking about. And when you did these experiments, I know there is a fancy technique that you have ruined for everyone else, that's accelerated rate calorimetry. Yeah, so that was the last chapter of Svante He's PhD thesis with Pierre Morin at Imperial. You know, the way we get kinetics that we use for a lot of our stuff is using accelerating rate calorimetry. And we often investigate thermal runaway parameters. So those, you know, parameters that bring you to runaway by assuming adiabatic conditions. So you assume that your condition, exactly, and you put it into this machine that's called accelerating rate calorimetry and out pop the kinetics effectively. That's a really simple way of putting it. But what Schwanz and Guillermo and I and a couple of others thought was, well, we do heat transfer. Adiabatic seems surprising when you have a system that has its own temperature generation, right? And it's not microscopic, right? A battery is not a millimeter size. Let us assume the battery is a point in space. And so, exactly. So Schwanz then did measurements to figure out if you do not ignore the heat transfer. So basically what you're assuming is that you're ignoring internal heat transfer, right? When you use accelerating rate calorimetry. And he said, well, what happens? Can we ignore internal heat transfer? So within the cell and external heat transfer at the cell surface. Because in accelerated rate calorimetry, you have a constant temperature wall. And he found that actually for, I think he used, I'm on the paper, so I need to be careful here with not getting things wrong. So he used lithium cobalt batteries, lithium cobalt oxide. So for his lithium cobalt oxide prismatic cell, he found that actually for temperatures that are much lower than thermal runaway, so, you know, very low temperature, then the temperature variation was between 1, 1.5 degrees. So between zero and one and a half degrees. So relatively small, right? The heat that you're missing, the negligence that you're getting from the heat transfer effects. But then he found that when thermal runaway does occur, so when you reach those higher temperatures, then the temperature that you've missed, the change that you've missed by ignoring the heat transfer effect can go from 10 degrees to 130 degrees. And so he found that actually, if you ignore external heat transfer effects, then you are underestimating the heat of reaction of the cell by about 12% for the cell that he was using. That's a lot. If the heat of reaction underestimated by 12% means that your kinetics, the estimated kinetics, will have a bigger error. And that error will grow as the number of cells grows, right? So I said that the temperature for self-feeding will decrease as you increase the size. So imagine you have more and more cells, then that error will compound. And did they go back to the warehouse calculations knowing that? So the paper came out last week, in fact. So it's a very new paper from his thesis. in fact. So it's a very new paper from his thesis. And basically, our conclusion was that if you ignore key transfer effects, then the thermal runaway parameters that you're quantifying using this technique will have errors that can propagate in your battery safety design. And so if you go back to the warehouse, make sure that if you're using that data for your calculation, you are aware of the errors so that you can use it in your prediction. Because, I mean, you do way more CFD than I do, Wojtek, and you know that it's fine. As long as you know what the error is, you can account for it and you can do error propagation. But if you don't know what it is and you don't have an error propagation, then you're going to have a lot of issues with design. I had a very nice talk about life as an engineer with Mike Speedpoint, and there was this consistent level of crudeness being mentioned that when you do very fine simulations and you have an underpinning assumption that has a major error, no matter how fancy your technique was, this initial error will propagate to whatever you do and will increase the uncertainty of whatever you've done by a lot. And if here the first thing you would assume that the reaction rate is this and you've missed it by 12 percent and that's the underpinning point of every single analysis you do for the next of your research. That's a huge miss and not the biggest one in the fire industry, but still. But I learned this with Guillermo. So I did my PhD with Guillermo Reyn. And when I started doing, so I started looking at self-heating from a modeling side, and I realized that I couldn't find the data I wanted in the literature because I wanted the errors. I wanted to know what the uncertainty was. And I couldn't find the data I wanted in the literature because I wanted the errors. I wanted to know what the uncertainty was. And I couldn't find the uncertainty. I said, well, if I model, I don't mind how big the uncertainty is. I need to know what it is. So then I ended up doing experiments to get said data. And then I put the errors. And Guillermo and I were having discussions in my first paper in my PhD because my error bars were quite large. And so then when I upscaled to real life scenarios, I was having these really big error bars. And in fact, if you look even now with Schwantz and Zenwin in our battery papers, when we upscale, our error bars are quite big. And I went back to Guillermo and we were looking at my figures and I was like, I'm really worried. And Guillermo said, but why? You know, if that's when you then use the data, you need to know what the uncertainty was. So we sent the paper for review. I got demolished by one of the reviewers. I got a little bit demoralized. We resubmitted the paper to combustion and flame, in fact. Got great reviews back. No problem with the errors. In fact, it was very good that you specified all the data. And so for me, it was actually, at the beginning, it was a bit worrying, but in fact, I learned and I've kept this throughout my career. And now that I'm an academic and I have my own PhD student, I am very careful always with or even with my postdoc on error uncertainty analysis. You know, I don't mind if the error is big, but it needs to be accurate so that if you then use it for modeling, you have as accurate as you can get data. It's something that my mentor, Professor Charnesky, said. Do you want to be roughly correct or precisely wrong? And roughly correct is sometimes that's all you can get. And to understand the limitations of your errors means you can... I mean, the data does not need to be super high fidelity to be useful. Models do not have to replicate reality 100% to be useful. These are tools for engineers. And I think here another lesson comes for the general fire safety engineering audience who may not be that big fans of cathodes and anodes. But here we are talking about quite difficult engineering topic where so many fields of science interlap. And then again, if these batteries burn down, it's us fire engineers who's going to be blamed that we didn't solve this issue. And methodologically going through it, understanding the limitations, understanding the impact of these small factors, gives you, in the end, a holistic view on a system, in this case, on a battery cell, that gives you space to work with. It's not that we're going to magically solve the problems of batteries, if one exists, actually. But we need to learn how to live with them and how to manage them in a way that is acceptable. And I think this is an achievable goal. What do you think? Yeah, I agree. And in fact, you know, if I go back even to Schwantz's first experiments, right, one single cell in cell feeding requires, you know, a room temperature, the cell at low 30% state of charge, so really safe, the one for travel, a single cell, super healthy, no issues, requires something like 150 degrees or 160 degrees room temperature, which is never going to be achievable. But if then two cells require 150, four cells require 145, and then, and then you scale and you get down figuring out that from what you can gather experimentally or numerically, if you can figure out what the material that's inside the box. I'm ignoring the separation. I'm ignoring a lot of things, right? But it should be good enough that we can then use it. If we try to do everything perfect, I mean, look at CFD. If we were to do a direct numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes for a box that's bigger than a meter cube, we'd be spending 150 years waiting for the solution. And so often, you know, we do combustion, right? So in combustion, we need to optimize our parameters. So if I'm looking at turbulence and I care about the really precise chemistry and chemical kinetics, then I will set up my simulation one way and I will make some assumptions. If I care about a really fast solution, but that gives me a temperature range for which my behavior will be in and I can afford to have a 50 degree error, then I will run it with much less chemistry, detailed chemistry. I will run it with fixed chemistry parameters and get my quick solution out. And so as an engineer, I mean, we have to wear two hats, right? So I'm a scientist, so I want things to be accurate and I want things to be precise. But as an engineer, I need it to be useful. Exactly. And so you need to find a balance in between the two. And having to wear both hats is the fun part of our research, I guess. But yeah, we need to remember that it has to be useful at some point. And the third hat of managing laboratory and health and safety. But that's not the topic for the podcast. And teaching and teaching hats and admin hats. But let's ignore those for now. I also have a podcast hat. It's great if you want to fit. It's fantastic. Thank you, Francesco. Thank you so much. I think this is a difficult topic, but the more you know your enemy, the less you're fearful of it. And I really want my audience, my people to understand what is the issue we are dealing with. It's in a way a mystical, magical technology, the fact you can capture a lightning inside of a small metallic pouch and use it to power your electric cigarette. Someone once said, I wanted to charge my book, but my wife was charging her cigarette. The future is stupid. It's a thing that enables us. And if you look at the world, it's actually one of the technologies that is necessary to change the planet, the fossil fuel, everything to a more sustainable future. And fire engineers... I like Guillermo's approach to this. So I'm going to steal Guillermo Rey' approach to this, which he uses in other fields. He says, you need to think about, when you think of a fire problem, I mean, technology is useful, right? But you need to think about how to prevent it, how to compartmentalize it. If a fire happens, how do you compartmentalize it? How do you detect it and how do you suppress it? And all four things are equally important because we always want to have prevention, right? We never even want to have a fire, but our job is also to figure out what happens if we do have a fire. So how do we compartmentalize it? How do we detect it so we know it's happening? And that's sort of what we were discussing earlier about voltage and temperatures. And how do you suppress it? Battery fire suppression is really, really complicated because the chemistry can get really complicated. Toxicity of some of the gases can be, there's hydrofluoric gases. I think even access to these cells that are reacting is the major obstacle at this time. And so it's putting all of those together that's important. And so our technology is, our future, technological future is always bright and it's always improving. But from a fire side, we're never going to prevent every single fire. And so we always need to think about the other aspects as well. Fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. And I will link to all the works that have been mentioned in the talk in the show notes. And please send me if you have something to add to that, because I think you've mentioned quite a lot of interesting research being done at your lab and at Imperial College. And it is absolutely worth sharing. I'm sure some people would like to dig in more. Absolutely, we'd be very happy to. And it's not limited. I mean, I'll send you the works we have done, but there's works from the U.S., works from Asia. You know, battery field is really growing. So I've shared our experiences, but thankfully there's a lot of researchers around the world. Thank you. Thank you so much for doing that. And thanks for coming to the Fire Science Show. I hope you've enjoyed. Thank you so much. See you around, man. Thank you for having me. Cheers. I hope this was a five-star worthy episode. From my perspective, it was because I finally learned what makes the batteries burn. And this is an interesting lesson. In the end, I would like to bring your attention again to the elephant in the room that Francesco pointed, that is the second life of batteries. If we want a sustainable future and a circular economy, there is no way we can just let them rot on the dump waste. And that will probably lead to catastrophical fires as well. So I don't think it's even a choice. We need to find a way how to reuse batteries. We need to find a way how to give them second life. Because of how they are manufactured, it's probably going to be difficult to disassemble them to first materials and then assemble again. So we probably need to find a usage for used lithium-ion batteries. We probably need to find a way how we can benefit from them again once they're ended their life cycle in the primary device they were in, like a car or laptop or something. And I think it's going to be a huge challenge. I know the focus today is on the safety of cars, buses, car parks, energy storage at buildings, mass energy storage facilities, maybe warehouses. But trust me, in a decade or two, when there are billions of used cells that need to be refurbished or reused, of used cells that need to be refurbished or reused. A lot of us will be dealing with the issues of how safely give batteries second life. And I think we should look forward to that. There is no sustainable future without reuse. So we need to be a significant part of that. And through the podcast, I will try to find great guests who can talk about this second life of batteries, even though there's not that much knowledge yet. But hopefully we can start working towards solutions before the problems start arising. And yeah, that would be pretty good. And for now, I think that's it for today's episode. Thank you very much for staying till the end and for listening to the show. And if you enjoyed, there's another episode for you waiting every Wednesday. So, see you there. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
