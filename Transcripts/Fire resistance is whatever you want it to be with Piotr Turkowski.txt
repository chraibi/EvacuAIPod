 Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the FireSense show. Today we're touching the subject of fire resistance or resistance to fire. Well, we're actually going to set that up later in the episode. It's something that we do here at the ITV at our fire testing laboratory. And many times I have told you that we fire professionals, especially ones that work with fire resistance as a concept, work with fire resistance tests, we understand that thing a little bit different than most of fire professionals because we know some insider stuff that dictates how materials behave, how they pass the tests, what's happening within the tests. So for today, I thought that it may be a great lesson for the fire engineers to learn something about how fire resistance is actually done in the fire laboratory. And for that purpose, I didn't have to look far for the guest. It's my great colleague, Dr. Piotr Turgososki who I had the privilege to sit across the desk and I've learned so much about fire resistance from that time I'm sure now having him on this on this podcast will allow us to learn a lot about it together even more so yeah Piotr is already here hello Piotr great to have you here hello Wojciech nice to see you nice to be here Piotr. Great to have you here. Hello, Wojciech. Nice to see you. Nice to be here. Long time no see. Great to have you in the podcast, finally. Piotr, you're very involved. Can you give a brief introduction to yourself, to the listeners? I mean, you're a representative of ITB and CN committees for fire resistance testing. You're our man in e-golf. You're doing lectures on how to perform fire tests properly. But give us a few words about yourself. That was actually a very nice introduction. Thank you. So yeah, I work at ITB for over 11 years right now, actually almost 12. So I did hundreds of tests, witnessed double the amount. I do participate in SEND committees, SEND TC127 in particular, and SEND SC250, so the one for Eurocodes and the one for fire resistance testing. I also do give some of my opinions on Eagle Forum. I also participate in those meetings in fire sector group. Basically, for the past few years, I've been sent to any fire group that actually is, that has something to do with our work in the laboratory. I did my PhD on carbon fire polymers, fire protection of such for reinforced concrete structures. Yeah, I'd say that is a summary of my person thank you very much you can also name emotions in in musical tracks which i find amazing and you also somehow know your codes by heart which i find disturbing so let's jump into the the subject fire resistance so if a person on the street if you pick a random person on the street and tell them, if I have a wall which has one hour fire resistance, what does that mean? My guess would be they will tell you, it will resist fire for one hour. But that's not a very precise answer to the question, because the question, well, as I know, working with you at ITB, fire resistance is a very precise thing. So first of all, let's try to define it. Like, what exactly is a fire resistance rating and fire resistance on its own? I think this is a very good topic to start with, because it's a very misunderstood concept of what fire resistance is. And if we go into testing, we would define fire resistance in classes. And a fire resistance class is something else than fire resistance itself. Because fire resistance class includes a test method, which you have used to determine this parameter. And it also includes the criteria you have applied to it. So, for example, if I say a fire resistance class of a concrete beam R60, and I will say that I have achieved that class during a test, it will mean something completely different if I say the same thing, but I would define the fire resistance class as, for example, a Eurocode does, or any other person could actually define his own parameters, because the Eurocode will use the temperatures inside the steel reinforcement. It would actually use bending momentum criteria or shear resistance and stuff like that. Whether in fire resistance testing, the only criterion for load bearing capacity is actually deflection of the element. It can be of any temperature whatsoever up to a certain point of deflection, which is actually quite insane. We would say that it has the phi resistance. And for example, this exact parameter has changed two years ago because before we had one value of that deflection. I will not bother you with the equation. But right now, we have multiplied the deflection by one and a half. So we actually allow 50% more deflection. And I think this approach is actually still better than the one that was also proposed. Because what people actually proposed at CEN was that only the failure, the breaking of the test specimen, its collapse, can be considered as loss of load-bearing capacity, fire resistance. And we actually can observe the quite opposite thing. For example, roofs tend to have a breaking point after something like 10 minutes, where they suddenly increase their deflection by 10, 20 centimeters very rapidly, and then they stop. And sometimes it's enough to lose load-bearing capacity, and sometimes it is not. But there is no failure. That roof can withstand another 20 or 30 minutes of fire. So fire resistance is basically what you want it to be. If you define your criteria and you present them to the reader, then obviously he will know what you mean. But if you go and say to someone, yeah, I have a wall of one hour fire resistance, that actually means nothing. It means absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. So yeah, the thing we do in the laboratory and the thing we do in our opinions most of the time, because we also act according to the legislature, which asks us for fire resistance classes. And it asks us for certain parameters in accordance with certain standards, the EN 13501.2 or Euro codes. So we have to follow them up, whether we like it or not, whether we agree with those criteria or not. We just follow them because that's basically the way that has been adopted that allows products to be compared. It's a little disturbing. Fire resistance can be whatever you want it to be. I mean, it seems like the answer is 42 to that question. In that case. Anyway, you've mentioned it being multiple things at the same time. On one way, it is like a cooking receipt for the test. You know, add this amount of heat or temperature with the furnace, measure this parameter. If it goes beyond this, it's failure. If not, it's OK. Measure the time with specific uncertainties, measure everything around, and this is, like, the outcome of the test is truly the fire resistance as tested. For the common man, it could be how long my building will withstand a fire without defining what the fire is. For a firefighter, it could be, or for the legislator, it could be a very convenient way to parameterize fire safety in the building code. You just need one number, like R60 or REI 120. You're good. If your thing does this test in this way, you're good. And then for the manufacturers, it would be another thing. As you said, it's a tool for comparison. It's like a measure in which they can compare the properties of their products measured in, let's say, all in the same way, because every product would have their own standard. And I think this is also important. We measure fire resistance of certain building elements. Like you measure a wall, you measure a column, you measure a ceiling. But we don't really measure the whole systems together. We don't measure the fire resistance of a building, right? How tricky it is to convert, for example, a slab from a building into the fire test. I mean, it will act completely different in the furnace than in the building, right? You're a structural engineer, enlighten me. Yeah, that's exactly the case. And obviously, every lab, so are we, we are limited by our furnaces, by the furnace size. There is a way to build a big furnace. We do have two such furnaces. One of them that we call Chimera can be extended to 12 meters span of elements. But at the same time, if you take a 12 meter span element, like a pre-stressed concrete beam or maybe pre-stressed concrete floor, and you calculate the deflection, when then you start to wonder, is the 3.7 meter depth of our furnace enough to accommodate for the deflection? Because the criterion goes insane. The criterias are written as for a standard size of test specimens, like 3 by 3 meters is for walls and 4 by 3 for floors. And then maybe they work. But otherwise, we start to see some insane deflections allowed or insane rate of deflections where basically the test specimen could bend toward our furnace to half of its depth and have, I don't know, burners above the actual test specimen and it wouldn't still be considered as a failure. So obviously there is a great limitation of what we can test and then how it applies to actual building. There are two ways to deal with that. We can build bigger furnaces, and so did we. We built a Phoenix furnace, which is 7 meters tall and 10 meters wide, and very soon test that made our previous understanding of behavior of test specimen irrelevant, because suddenly some completely different failure modes occurred. For example, for lightweight partitions made of gypsum boards, the whole world tested 3x3 meters walls, but the actual need was for so much bigger walls, like maybe in a cinema or in theater or in other spaces where you had to have like eight meter tall wall, maybe even 12 meters. So what can you do if you only have a three by three furnace? You can start to calculate. But what happened when we've tested such wall? Well, the unexpected happened because the wall didn't fail because of the deflection. It didn't fail because of the temperature. It failed because the actual length of the arc of the wall, once it deflected, made it disconnect from the top fixing. It basically unfixed itself from the lintel. So it failed in a way that no one has ever thought before. So what the producers do right now, they create a kind of telescope, a special device at the top of the wall to make it move downwards and upwards throughout the entire test or maybe throughout the fire in the building. We only can say what we saw in the test. And that was unexpected. The same thing happened with hollow core concrete slabs. Well, the first thought of everybody was, well, what's difficult about concrete? It's just reinforcement. You calculate bending momentum, you calculate the temperature of the reinforcement, and you have everything. And then people started testing those, and they didn't fail because of bending. They failed because of sheer failure. And then they failed because the anchorage was not enough in the anchorage zone. And it's very funny to observe how that knowledge spreads to standards. Because if you go for a standard for hollow core slabs, the EN 1168, and you read its first edition from 2000-something, its bending failure is enough. Then you go have plus I1. Well, bending failure is not enough. You have to consider shear. Then you have plus A2 edition. You know what? Actually include anchorage as well. And then there's plus 3 edition. You know what? The shear and anchorage is actually way more severe. And if you go with the same concrete slab between these four additions of the standard, you go from REI 180 to REI 60, something like that, for the same product. And throughout the years, people were doing that. And it's incredible because the standard was issued in something like 2005. And I remember, okay, I don't remember because I wasn't at ITB at the time, but I know that we have done such tests in 2002 at ITB together with DBI from Denmark. We've done such tests and we've shown this problem and it took Senn only 10 years to incorporate that into the standard. Which for Senn is actually not that slow. Which for Senn is actually not that slow. Which for Senn is actually not that slow, unfortunately, yeah. But 10 years later, yesterday, I had an opportunity to review a paper submitted to a journal last three months, something like that. And it was about hollow core and hollow sphere concrete slabs. And all the knowledge is not present. People only care about bending. They still forget about shear. They still forget about the anchorage. And they don't include that in their calculations. So you said that the way to understand bigger elements, to understand the effects of scale, which at this point we were relying purely on calculation methods or our predictions or our expectations on how bigger elements would behave. Now we can build bigger furnaces to accommodate bigger elements to observe these effects of scale. My issue with that, and it's in a way a critique of my own laboratory, but it is what it is. My issue with that is that the furnace was never a great representation of a real fire. Even, you know, the three by three meter furnace, even if you assumed that it's fully flash-over fire, it's not a perfect representation. It's not a representation at all. It's just a furnace condition. However, as you build bigger furnaces, the further away you go from real fires. Like the big furnace we have is 10 by 7 meter tall. Like the hell, what kind of fire does that represent? I mean, it's gigantic. I really struggle to imagine a fire that would have uniform conditions because that's also a point. The furnace is meant to provide you in uniform conditions over the sample. Now, I struggle to see a fire that would provide uniform conditions over a sample. So maybe these telescopes, these solutions that are invented to pass the test, are they going further away from your fire? Are they serving the safety or just serving the glass? That's something I struggle with. That's a really good point, which I was trying to get to. But it's a really good point, showing that the first way we can deal with bigger elements, with real buildings, is building bigger furnaces, is actually not the way. Because they do not represent real fires. These fires would have to be insane to be so long, so consistent over the entire volume, the entire space that is in fire. We do get away from what the actual fire is. But the other option is actually not better, because the other option is calculations. And that's the way that our standards, so-called EXAPs, the Extended Application of Test Results standards, they go with calculations. But the way they do it, they cut so much science out of them to basically incorporate only equations that include addition, maybe some multiplication, maybe one more factor or something like that. And sometimes not even that. They are just wishes. Like if we keep the lightweight partitions in place, you can do 12 meter wall with that X-up. But the way you do it, well, they say, okay, the way you can have a higher wall, you just have to have an overtime. If your wall was 60 minutes and you get 66 minutes, that's good enough. And then you can start building higher walls. This is absolutely not a scientific approach. And I don't want to be mean to anybody who wrote that. I know how hard it is to work on such standards. And that's basically the reason why new EXAP standards have to have their background documents for people to see how people came with such solutions. But what they do is that there is no science in that. For masonry walls, it's almost the same. If you have managed to get your wall for 60 minutes and the deflection of the wall towards the furnace wasn't bigger than half of its thickness, which is almost never the case, then you can raise the wall up to eight meters because of reasons, basically. It's important to say that to people who are not involved in writing the standards in this part of fire engineering. The people involved in these committees are usually two types of people. Either there are people representing the laboratories, which, I'm sorry, they have their interests. Like, there are certain sizes of elements written in the standards for a reason, because it's the furnaces that exist. You don't want to write a standard for furnaces that do not exist, because then people have an issue. And the other group is manufacturers, producers. You know, we love this, you know, that represent their own particular interests of putting products on the market. And essentially, there is nothing wrong with that, As long as we understand it is like that. It's not a group of scientists who would start thinking, what is the ultimate measure of safety of a masonry wall? And let's define it, how to build the safest wall in the world. No, it's not that. It's about how can we put the product on the market with the standardized test that everyone on the table agrees to, right? Yes, that's exactly the group of people we meet at CEN. They're great people. They're smart people. They're nice people. It's in their agenda. They come to the meeting, which is related to where they work, who they work for, and how they earn their living. It's not about the people. It's about the system. Yeah. Sorry. I had to say that. I like these people. I like these people very much. Each one of them, it's really nice to meet them, even though it's only on Teams right now. But I like to see myself as a person that acts on the benefit of a user, that I don't want to write a standard or participate in writing a standard that increases the amount of testing that needs to be done. If it's unnecessary, if it actually misrepresents the science we have. And one example of this can be seen in Eurocode versus the fire testing of fire protection of concrete elements. Because in Eurocode, in the new edition, the concrete up to a very high class of concrete, C70, is immune to spalling. But in fire testing, every concrete is susceptible to spalling. And you have to test a range of concrete classes to actually give that. And I am fighting very hard to change that, to reduce the amount of testing that needs to be done. But otherwise, you can see some insane actions from the manufacturers, especially in glazed partitions, in glazed doors, where they do have very complex elements. Glazed door is made of 60 to 80 components, and each one of them can have some influence over the fire resistance. You have a lock, you have the closing. Gasket, shield, knob, everything has an impact. The shell, the glass, the aluminum glass, everything. So there's a lot of parameters. So obviously they do not want to make a hundred tests because it costs. It's basically a cost. And in the end, who will pay that? It's not them. It would be the users. The product will be simply more expensive. So I'm trying to balance this, but it's a really hard topic to balance, especially because of the way we perceive certain criteria and the way we measure them. Some of them are very quantitative. The temperature is quite obvious, but it's also a point of discussion. And we do stick with the 140 and 180 Kelvin temperature rise over the unexposed surface most of the time. But there are voices, voices that come from important people like Barbauskas, who says, no, it's too low. You can rise it up to 300, maybe even 400 degrees. And that would change the whole market because suddenly so many other products could be seen as fire resistant. Sorry, but the challenge, do we even know where these values came from, these 140, 180? Or these are the words written in the code forever and no one even dares to touch the origin of them? Because it's also very interesting as a concept. The fire resistance as a concept has a build-up of 100 years for now. So do we know that? I know just a little. And I don't know if it's big... Just a rumor. Maybe just some rumors. And I don't know if it's because such knowledge doesn't exist, or maybe I just didn't have time or skill to dig up to it. But as for the temperature, it's supposed to represent the element that could be on the other side, that could actually ignite from the temperature itself. And Barbauskas argues that if that's the case, that the temperature needed is not that. It's way more than that. So why do we stick with such low temperatures? If I had to place a bet, I would bet that someone just 100 years ago, they just did the test. Okay, that looks okay. Let's stick with that. And if I had to bet my money on that, I would put it on that. And if any one of you listeners know the origins of that, I'm very interested in learning that. Because, oh boy, as a fire safety community, we have totally lost our ability to understand where the magic numbers came from. And that's one of my goals in the podcast. You started talking about intumescence. Yeah, I'll go. I just want to give one more story about the temperature. Yeah, yeah. Because we do stick with the 180, let's say, caldions as a temperature rise, yes? But sometimes it's not so convenient. Sometimes the market actually can influence the way we perceive fire resistance. So, for example, in Great Britain, they have a ton of wooden door. Yeah? They like them. And they can keep these criteria. They can maintain the temperature rise below that value. But if you have steel door with steel frame, there is absolutely no way. This is just too much of insulation you're asking. So what we did, well, if you cannot keep the I1 criteria, let's go with I2 criteria. And that allows you to have a temperature rise of 360 kelvins in certain areas. So, you know, if it's not convenient, we can change that. But otherwise, let's keep the other criteria. As for the intermittent, well, that's a story of many aspects on how to game the fire testing, on how to game the product into being good for the test. But you have absolutely no idea how it will behave in a real fire. Or maybe you have a very limited amount of knowledge. I don't want to speak in such absolutes. So why is that? Intubation paint basically works because it swells, because it produces that foam and encapsulates air or gases inside of it. And those gases are basically the insulation. But the activation of the products inside intumescent paint doesn't happen just like that. It happens because a certain heat flux acts on it. And in a standard testing, first of all, the temperature always rises. Second of all, the temperature rises in a very particular way. You have a pre-described fire curve. And then if heat acts on intumescent paint, some first products will start to swell at 200 centigrade, then maybe at 250, 300, and so on, up to a point where you have a really nice foam that starts to insulate, and your temperature rise in steel gets much, much lower. And then you can keep the temperature below a certain temperature of, let's say, 500 degrees for maybe 30 or 60 minutes, maybe even 90. But what would happen if that fire wasn't like that? What could happen if your fire is very small at the beginning? Maybe it's only 200 degrees, but then suddenly you have the flash over and then it goes more like standard temperature. Well, people thought of that and they introduced the smoldering curve and some countries require that, some do not. And you check whether your paint would behave in the same manner, whether it was still active. In a much lower temperature, in a much lower curve. In a much lower curve at the beginning, and then when it goes to the regular curve. But there are two curves they've tested, and that's it. What would happen if you had the opposite? What would happen if you have an intumescent paint on an element that could be subjected to very rapid and very high temperature fire at the beginning? And then it gets lower. So, for example, a hydrocarbon fire. That would be completely different behavior. And it was observed. I mean, we do it all the time. We can see that the swelling ratio of the paint is not exactly the same for one curve or another. And when I said about gaining the fire testing, well, the fire testing for the first five to ten minutes is basically chaos. It's mayhem. Anything can happen in the furnace. It almost doesn't matter what your temperature is because your criteria start to kick in around the tenth minute. It almost doesn't matter what the pressure is because also this criterion kicks in after five minutes. So you have a period of when you can do in tests something that will influence your test result, but something that will never be seen by anyone who only reads the classification in the end. to do to gain. And they've asked us, for example, to increase the pressure in the furnace in the first minutes because it doesn't matter, but because it will help to activate the product, the intumescent, so it swells better. That's one way. The other way to gain it is that standards are not perfect. They tend to give some guidance of what your test specimen should be. But then you can choose such test specimen, and I'm speaking particularly about intumescent paint and sprayed mortars or board fire protection systems, the ones which are tested in accordance to EN 13281 Part 4 and Part 8, where you can take such load-bearing beam that your failure will occur at such a point that you will get always the best correction factor. I don't want to go into much detail on what that is. I think that if people know these products and know what correction factor is, they will know how much it influences the results. So people are gaming that, and we change standards because of this, but we know only as little as we have thought ourselves or what the customers told us, but they probably have some aces up their sleeves still. It's everywhere where you assess a family because if you have to assess a family of products, it is literally impossible to test them all. So there must be a way to extending the individual tests into the performance of the whole family. We have the exact same thing in natural smoke ventilators where we assess the discharge coefficient of the ventilator and the standard basically tells you what types of vents to take for this test based on the ratio of their dimensions and it tells you to take at least four. Sometimes you can take a little more than that and then just find which combination of four between them gives the most optimistic assumption about the performance of the family. I mean, that's the way how the industry works. That's why I wanted to do this podcast as well, because the fire resistance or the fire properties, how they are assessed in the laboratory, it is a much, much bigger story than just the index. It's not that you take the same wall, put it in a furnace in Poland, in France, in UK, and expect it to be the exact same. There are these minuscule differences. Of course, in our e-golf groups, in our CN commissions, we share this knowledge. We try to work up the standards so they're harder to gain, that are more unbiased, but it's a slow process. But you've also mentioned that in scientific papers, you have not observed the, in a particular paper, you have not observed the growth that you have observed in the standard. And from this talk alone, we already see there's so much knowledge hidden in the laboratory people. Does this knowledge surface anywhere else than CEN committees? Does your experiences or experiences of our colleagues in other labs actually influence how fire safety is delivered in the world? Or is it a secret knowledge passed from generation of lab workers to the next generation? Honestly, I'm starting to doubt it even surfaces in sand anymore. Because the way the new standards are changing, especially Eurocode for masonry walls. I don't think that there is enough proof for the claims that this standard wants to introduce. The same happens for glazed products. And for example, we are working currently or beginning to work for fire protection for aluminum products. And we've asked everybody to share their test results. I think for the past 12 months, we haven't received any. So maybe laboratories keep them to themselves. Maybe they don't want to publish them. But I think there's another topic here that is influencing very much how we perceive fire testing. And this is the uncertainties that are inherent to fire testing. And we see them very much, especially in round robins. I've heard you like stories. I will give you the story that makes you not want to do any fire tests anymore. So you've mentioned EGOLF. EGOLF is a great group. It's a group of fire testing laboratories. There are very many of them. We tend to be number one there. So we like them. We like to share their logo on our test reports. Unfortunately, eGolf is no longer Google-able because of the introduction of electrical golf from Volkswagen. So I will share with you this. I need to give you the link. You cannot Google this. Yeah, there is a secret link. It's eagles.global. There is no way you could think of global as a domain, but it exists. So eagles.global, that is your address. So they do round robins, and round robins are great when you think about them. And then they are very terrible when you start to compare the test results. So they did many round robins for the past few years. And I want to talk about two of them. One which I have personally participated in and the one that happened recently that caused so much trouble and such ripple in fire testing that will hopefully change many ways that we do fire testing. So the first one is about steel beam. Imagine a steel beam made without any fire protection material whatsoever. All of the steel beams come from one factory. They do have the same properties or basically the paper claims they do have all the same properties. The steel beam is HEB 300. It's loaded in a very little way. It's only about 20% of its load-bearing capacity. And each lab tests two of such beams. You couldn't imagine a more simple test. It's only steel beam. And if we... No protection. No protection whatsoever. Only steel, fully exposed to fire on three sides. And we were talking about the criterias. The deflection criterias were made for steel. They weren't made for concrete. They weren't made for timber, for any other product. They were made for steel. They weren't made for concrete. They weren't made for timber, for any other product. They were made for steel. So the criterion itself basically applies to the very test specimen you are testing. So many labs, I think there were over 20, participated in this round, Robin. Could you imagine what the spread of test results was for steel beam? 20%. 20% would be really nice. The actual spread, I will give you our results. I don't want to do a commercial of ITB, but it will be a commercial of ITB because we have tested two such beams. And the difference in our test results was 15 seconds for the failure. It was 29 minutes and 29 minutes and 15 seconds. So basically I'd say, yeah, this is nice. And the beam was designed for 30 minutes? The beam was designed for 30 minutes. But when you checked the results of every other lab, well, some of them got 16 minutes. Some of them got 45. So it's like, what? I mean, it's a steel beam. And I want to say our test results was really nice. We did a paper with colleague Marek ≈Åukomski on that. We compared our test results with calculation method from Eurocode. We also did a coupled analysis, thermomechanical analysis of that beam. And we got the same result each time. But some labs got 16 minutes. You wouldn't want to go there, obviously. But the ones that got 45, well, fantastic lab. I mean, I will do all my tests there. So this was still being a very simple test. But the other round-robin was about doors. So that's a way more complex element. And that is two subjects. The first one is that that product hasn't actually been tested before because its classification came exactly from what you've said, from evaluation of a family of products. So they didn't test these doors in particular. They tested some other and they said, well, because this and that, these doors could be regarded as the same class. They look 30 to me. They look 30 to me. But here the spread was insane. It was between a few minutes to 90 or something like that. That virtually makes absolutely no physical sense on how that could happen. makes absolutely no physical sense on how that could happen. And even if we exclude a very failed test because of obvious mistakes, you still get a spread of 100% to 200% of the test results. Is it 30 plus minus 30? It's 30 plus minus 30, yeah, something like that. What does it say of the product? And the problem is that it also showed how much different laboratories read the standard. The standards are maybe 30 pages long, some of them. And you can still find mysteries on how to deal with the pressure, how to deal with the temperature, where to put thermocouples. And those mistakes, maybe, okay, I don't want to say mistake. Those misinterpretations of what was intended by some other general interpretation of the standard were so huge that there are courses ongoing right now on changing that. There are standards being changed on how to exactly calculate the pressure inside the furnace because it all influences your test results. So at the beginning, I said, if you say to me what a fire resistance class is, I will tell you it goes with the test method. But right now, you cannot even be sure of that because it actually also goes with the laboratory behind the test. And this is something that shouldn't happen. But it's something that actually, unfortunately, is our reality. I'm in the head of my listener now who entered this podcast in expectation to learn what the fire curve is and how much pressure we applied in the furnace. And now we're in the world of uncertainty in experiments that's like 100% scatter. And then on the building, the firefighter will tell you, okay, this is 30-minute doors, so they give you exact 30 minutes in the fire. And that's what publicity expects. If there's a major fire, that's what the journalists will be digging into, you know? What was the fire resistance of that door? What classifications they have obtained? What was the fire resistance of that door? What classifications they have obtained? I mean, I've expected that, but it's even worse than I thought. This disjoint of what the test is for us, for manufacturers, for AHAJs, and for the general public. This is crazy. You maybe remember when we had our paper on fire resistance of timber walls in review. And we wrote something that the public understanding of the test is like this. So we really need to rethink the test to adjust it a little bit so it represents reality better. The reviewer was like, wouldn't it be easier to just change how people perceive the test? Well, no. It's almost impossible to change the perception because we are working here in a very small circle of highly specialized people who are literally the only group who understands how it works. And then everyone else from fire engineers to fire scientists have some assumptions or presumptions of what we do, what we produce, and what the behavior of the elements is. I think this is a very important and difficult podcast episode. Thank you for sharing all of this. I have to look on the bright side of that. I don't want to be an atheistilist, but it's very hard. It's very difficult. Are we the good guys, Piotr? Are we the good guys? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I ask it myself. Because what is the alternative? What is the alternative to testing? Okay. Yeah. It's chaos. It's chaos. It's chaos. It's chaos. It's even more of what made testing where it is now. It's more of calculations methods, more of presumptions, more of expectations, what it would look like if it was different. You know, it's unvalidated modeling. It's reduction of meshes because of computational time, so I achieve my results quicker. It's the desktop studies in the UK. That's the alternative. So out of these two worlds, I think highly specialized people want to understand their craft because fire testing is a craft. In the end, there's a place for fire laboratories for sure. And the model worked. Like if you look at the bigger picture, the model has certainly worked in delivering fire safety to everyone. It's just these few fires that caused massive damage in which fire resistance was misunderstood. They're like the trouble now. Because overall, the model seems to be working fairly well. So maybe less negative view for once. Yeah, that's definitely the bright side of the topic. We definitely have way less fires. We definitely have safer buildings. But there's a shade on that as well. Well, it comes with the costs. We obviously incorporate very demanding classes from many products. We incorporate other active fire prevention systems, sprinklers, fire detection alarms, stuff like that, smoke control. So there's a lot, and it comes with a cost, obviously. It comes with a cost that our buildings do not cost anymore. What they did 50 years ago, they cost way more. Just like with cars, we put more and more safety features in them, automation and other things that we could live without. But they do increase our safety beyond maybe... Okay, I don't know if it's beyond the point we need. Maybe there is no value to human life. It's invaluable, basically. It's priceless, yes. But then our car starts to be quite expensive. so are our buildings and especially tunnels we discussed many times on how the rws fire came to be what it is and how it's now being applied to tunnels which are way taller where you maybe don't have such exposure anymore but we still do do act with RWS fire. And I think that brings us to another topic that we could talk about, is what is the standard fire versus the real-world fires, yes? Oh boy. Oh boy, yeah, indeed. And how the behavior of material changes. Because if the alternative is calculations, and I fully agree with that, and a shift to numerical analysis or AI learning, machine learning stuff is... Digital twinning is an interesting concept. It will definitely happen. Then how do we predict the behavior of the material we use for over a century right now, which is concrete. If you expose concrete to standard fire curve, it will most likely behave like you would think it would. Basically, nothing will happen, or some very superficial spalling will occur for the first few minutes of the testing. And basically, that's it. There will be some moisture on the unexposed side, and that's it. But if you put the same slab for hydrocarbon-modified fire curve or RWS curve, it can actually explode. I mean, I've seen spalling that made the slab jump over the furnace, and not like a few millimeters. It jumped like to the height of my head. It jumped like to the height of my head. I've seen concrete elements exploding and people running away from the furnace because of the falling, because the concrete was pre-stressed. And once the strand was exposed to heat, it lost its capability to stress the concrete. And suddenly this whole energy release made the floor explode, virtually explode. We had concrete that melted our furnace. We had concrete that contained basaltium aggregate, and we exposed it to RWS curve. And after the test, we have found out that our very new furnace built a few months ago, after the very first test, requires a repair that costs hundreds of thousands of euros because the whole lining was covered in melted basalt. I thought I would get fired after that, but I didn't. So I was way more courageous for any other tests I did in the future because I knew if that didn't get me fired, nothing is going to. Yeah, there's still marks on our furnace. Every one of you is invited to visit a fire testing laboratory. Ten years later, you can still see the marks. You still can see the marks. They will be there forever. So, yeah, the standard fire curve is 100 years old. Definitely everything changed since then. Our fires are not anymore cellulose fire, as they're also being called. We have way more plastic, oil-based materials, plastics. Our furniture is plastic. Our clothes are plastic. So it's a different fire. So obviously the standard curve, and I'm telling you that the method comes with it. I want to also add one more thing. I want to say that the way we measure stuff in fire resistance testing, on one hand, can be so very detailed up to a point where it actually doesn't really matter. And on the other hand, we take some things without any consideration that causes the biggest failures of all. So I want to give an example for that. On one hand, we do tend to stick with the temperature measurement. We do have huge science for the thermocouples, for the plate thermometers on their size, what it's supposed to be, how we neglect the back radiation from the test specimen, but at the same time, we actually measure mostly the radiation that goes towards the plate thermometer. But on the other hand, we have this standard fire curve. And the standard fire curve, well, you know way better than me what is its origin. And you know how flawed it is in its very core. But we are still using it 100 years later. So we do measure the deflection and define the criteria because of that. But at the same time, we measure the integrity by application of cotton pads. Yes, that's a very scientific approach. Very scientific cotton pads, yeah. Well, it's very qualitative. And I think that's the part where people are thinking. It's not like, I mean, for sure people are thinking how to improve it. But at the same time, we are stuck at some point. Fire testing is necessary. Product ranking is necessary. Product certification is necessary. All these things are necessary. And I think it would be difficult to scratch the concept. I mean, it's impossible to scratch the concept. We need that. At the same time, what we need is a little better understanding that fire engineering is engineering. Guys, let's engineer this. I know it's easy when you write a law to state a class. Class goes with the standard. That can change five times over the course of a decade. I mean, it's easy. Maybe it's the way. Maybe if you think about the overall costs of introducing more sophisticated methods of testing, of validating, maybe actually that's the cheapest and the easiest and the safest way, actually. Maybe it is. But still, I feel an obligation that we try to understand it better. We try to figure out some stuff. try to understand it better. We try to figure out some stuff. And I also feel there is a place for labs like ours in a performance-based fire engineering world. I really like, you know, I don't like doing tests. I like doing experiments. And I think places like ours is perfect for experimenting, where you don't close yourself in this preconception of what a class is, what are the failure criteria, where you can really open your mind and discuss, is this charring on this element something dangerous or not? Does this lead to a failure or not? A very recent example where you can discuss that, think about it and decide whether it is safe or not. I really enjoy this way of working in the fire lab. However, this is a very, very minor part of the everyday work we do here. Well said, and I envy you. The opportunities you have as a person who doesn't have to deal with these fire resistance tests, the standard fire resistance tests, and you can... Outside of fans. Fans are funny. I could make an episode about fire resistance fans, which I did. Boy. Yeah, I accept that. But you have the freedom to experiment, to build any structure you want and to measure whatever you want. And that's what I said at the beginning. The fire resistance is what you think, what you want it to be. You can shape it. You can see stuff you will never see on furnaces because of its limitations. And because most of our tests are commercial tests. So their basic purpose is to place the product on the market. And the manufacturer, sometimes they are, but most of the time they are not involved in science. They virtually don't care. Some of them do. Let's give the credit to those who do. Yes, some of them absolutely do. But generally, they don't. Generally, their aim is to place the product on the market with specific parameters, and they are willing to repeat the test as many times as it's needed to achieve it. Sometimes they will do some improvements. Sometimes they will just act on the fact that fire resistance testing is single testing. There is no statistics. You do not have to get three samples of the same product and each one of them has to achieve certain parameters. You do a single test and there is nothing stopping them from exploiting that. And sometimes the problems that occur are very rare and sometimes they are basically mistakes or something that happens once every million years or something like that. I can tell you about the test about glazed doors where... Okay, let's finish this depressing episode with a little bit of fun. Yeah. On the cost of our clients, but no names. No names. But the test was hilarious. So there is a test. You can see yourself seeing doors with some side panel and some top panel. They're all made of glass. And the one fact you have to know about glass for it to work is that it has to break in order to expose the gel, which is inside, to heat. And then this gel expands and creates a barrier for poor heat. So for the ones who are not in line with properties of fire protective glazing, it's literally many layers of glass and there's a gel between them. is literally many layers of glass and there's a gel between them. So once some of the glass falls out, gel activates, and this gel is meant to stop the fire, not the glass itself. Exactly. So the glass breaks. The glass breaks and the glass falls. And once in a blue moon, you will see that the glass falls on the handle. And we've witnessed such tests. The glass falls on the handle. It opened the door, and the test was over. It is a failure. Two minutes into the test and it's over. Because first, you have a crack. You have a smoke leakage. Smoke itself doesn't fail integrity. You have an open door. But you have open doors. And the whole frame loses its rigidity. So if it wasn't for that, a few minutes later, the top panel basically breaks, completely falls off outside the furnace, and the test is over. I think that's the number one funniest we've seen. There were some. In furnace testing, it's always exciting when the things break. The clients have an absolutely opposite point of view. For them, it's most exciting when things do not break, the clients have absolutely opposite point of view. For them, it's most exciting when they things do not break, but it makes this job interesting. Okay, Piotr, thank you. Thank you so much for joining me in here. I guess I'll be flooded with emails after this episode, with probably some people very angry at us. However, I think it was important. I always thought being open about what we do is the only way how the fire science can move forward. And I really wish we are the good guys trying to do something better. And if anyone knows how we can do our job better, please tell us. We will very gladly take your advices and we can also talk. So you improve your understanding of our craft and what's really happening in the fire lab. That's a perspective that has not been in the podcast yet. And thank you so much for bringing it here. It was a pleasure. And I hope people will enjoy this episode. There was a lot of doubt in this episode, but in the end, it's something that works and we would love to make it work better. And yeah, you gave me an idea. I should do that episode a long time ago, Compatible Fires versus Standard Curve. Boy, that would be a funny episode. Thanks, Piotr, and see you around. Thank you very much, and see you all. Thank you. Bye-bye. And as you may have figured it out, that's it for today's episode. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope we didn't insult anybody personally. I mean, from my own experience, people in the fire testing industry are really great people, good people. We have some systematic challenges to work with. That's for sure. We have some competing interests to work around. And this brings challenges like the ones that have been discussed in this episode. I hope the image does not go too negative after this. I mean, it's not. I just wanted you to understand some specific conditions, some challenges that you may not be exposed to in your everyday work, and that will help you understand better the challenges that we have to go through, and that will let you understand the meaning behind the indexes a little bit better, and understand the challenges that go with that, and understand that, as I said many times, fire resistance does not tell you the whole story of fire behavior. It cannot be used as one sole only proxy of performance of materials, elements in fire. It was never its purpose. Its purpose was ranking tool, classification tool, something that you can measure and compare against another product. That's the ultimate goal of fire resistance. And it should be treated like that, not as an ultimate proxy of safety. So, yeah, thank you for staying with us in this very challenging episode. We had a lot of fun recording this, but trust me, it was a difficult conversation. And, yeah, I'm happy we did it. And what else? I hope to see you here in the next week next Wednesday another podcast episode waiting here for you cheers this was the fire science show thank you for listening and see you soon
