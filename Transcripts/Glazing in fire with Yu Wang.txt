 Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. Finally, I got you the episode I was talking a lot about in the previous episode, and that is the glass and fire experiment. Extremely important subject in fire and fire dynamics studies and very, very relevant for the whole fire engineering concepts of buildings. And yet, not that many people research that, and it's not very easy to find experts on modern glazing virus. So I'm really, really happy that I found one, and that is really, really good. And that is Professor Wang Yu from UICC in China. Yu is probably better known for his involvement in the IRIS project on informal settlements, where he's project won all awards that were available to get in the last years. And that was an amazing development and something that eventually must come into the podcast, because I would love to share that with you. Anyway, he also has done his PhD on glass and fire. He did extensive research on glazing and fire during his time in Edinburgh. Now he's continuing that in China. So he has really great experience, experimental and modeling experience in the glass behavior. A lot to learn from him. This episode is probably more engineering and technical than the usual podcast episodes. So there's a lot of terms flying around without warning. So maybe I'll try to give you a little background on that. So we're talking about the glazing and different glazing technologies. If you think about a simple glass panel, like the simplest form of glass, that would be something we call the float glass and that's just glass nothing else now if you subject this glass to temperature during the process of tempering and then cooled it down you pre-stress the glass and you receive something that we call the tempered glass and that's something that behaves completely different as you will explain and this is something that is very focal to his studies, because this type of glass is very force-strain resistant. So it's used for facades, especially for facades in large buildings. You cannot build a really big glass panel out of different types of glass than that. So it definitely is an important type of glass to be considered. There's also more. There's laminated glass. So you take a piece of glass and you put a foil on it that changes some of the properties of the whole glass system. You receive basically a float glass that sticks to a layer of foil. And then the foil changes the behavior because suddenly if you crack the glass, pieces will not fall off because they're sticking to the foil. So again, different behavior. And many times in the episode you'll hear a name, PVB foil, that's a polyvinyl buttreat or something, foil. That is a key component in this laminated glass and connecting the glass layers together. glass layers together. And it has certain characteristics, certain properties that we need to study to understand how the glass behaves as a system. And finally, well, you'll learn that in the episode, but glass is really critical for compartment fire dynamics, the development of fires. We make many assumptions related to the ventilation conditions in which the fires take place. But do we really consider if these conditions can occur in our buildings? Like, it's really modeling a huge compartment fire, taking into account that 200 square meters of windows are already open when the fire starts. Is this really a realistic fire scenario? I don't know. I hope you make up your own opinion after this episode and you learn a lot about the glass behavior of fire. And I was thrilled to finally have someone to chat about this topic because I find it one of the fundamentals for modern fire safety. So, yeah, it's a little longer introduction than usual. I hope the episode meets your high hopes. So, yeah, let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host. Everybody, welcome to Fire Science Show. I'm today with Professor Wang Yu from State Key Fire Laboratory of the USTC from China. Hello, great to have you on the podcast. Hello, Bec. Thank you for taking my invitation. I was looking for an expert on glass or glazing in fire for a while, and eventually you got recommended, and I'm super excited to do this interview because this subject for me, with every fire experiment I make, is more and more important. So maybe let's start with a nice way. So maybe can you tell me about your previous studies? When did you build your interest on glazing in fire and how did it develop for you? Actually, I started these area from my PhD study. I mean, from nearly 10 years ago. Yeah, so during that stage, we conducted some experiments and also developed numerical software using the finite element method to predict the thermal stress varying and the strength during the fire or the thermal loading. And we successfully predicted the correct path and correct propagation of the glazing. And after that, so that we can make some full-scale experiments and validate our simulation. So we started this area from there. And for now, we are conducting some experiments to understand the interaction between the glass and compartment fire. This is exactly why I brought you here, because this interaction is very fundamental to understanding fire and fire design in buildings. fundamental to understanding fire and fire design in buildings. First, maybe let's start with the glass. Because, you know, if you look back 30, 40, 50 years ago into the golden era of fire science and experiments being conducted, the glass used in buildings 30, 40, 50 years ago was a completely different thing than what we use today in terms of its thermal properties for the buildings, but also in terms of properties to fire. Now we have this modern glaze technologies with tempered glass, laminated glass, different infill panels, different layers, two-layered windows, three-layered windows. Can you try and comment on how this modern technology differs from this old type, like single glass panel windows from the far past ago? Yes, sure. It's a very good question. So actually, 30 or 40 years ago, like Pegney, they started very elegant research to then predict the temperature difference of non-temperature glass. But that kind of glass is primarily used for the windows, not for the glass facade. So actually, in the very recent 10 years from my PhD study, we started to focus on the glass facades on the Harris buildings. So like what you said, this is very different. For example, in China, it is required that you have to use the tempered glazing in the glass facade. So I think the most difference is that the tempered glass, when you manufacture the tempered glass, actually it's manufactured from the non-tempered, from the fluted glass. And during the manufacturing, if you reduce the glass surface temperature very quickly then you will get some pre-stress in the glazing so namely it has three layers of pre-stress the the compress the tensile and the compress so due to this pre-stress that the glass can withstand much more more much higher temperature than the float breathing so I think this is very different so that's why I think when we started the glass we have to go into the stress under the fire and the combined some stress and the pre-stress together to that to get the critical point of crack initiation then after it's, different from the float one, for tempered, it will totally fall out for the single glazing, because they have to release the energy in the pre-stress glazing. But for float glass, they have a lot of cracked paths. So that's totally different. So actually, why we are now starting the template glazing? Because for the float to work, if we want it to fire up in the fire, so it has to be a crack ignition, crack pass, then press, cross each other to forming the islands. That some pressure may happen, may press on the glazing or some fire, so make it fall out. Like a part of the glass where the island of cracks has made and then this part will fall off, not the whole window, right? Yeah, not the whole window. Only the islands. So it may fall out gradually. So, for example, maybe 10% of that, 50%, like that. So it's very difficult to practice that, realize a lot of probabilistic problems you know the fire is often complicated and actually the glass you know also you know why the glass crack because it has a lot of very tiny flaws which you cannot see it on eye yeah so the tiny flaws this script very in a very randomly. So both the glass crack initiation, both the fire are very problematic, so very difficult to crack that. But so it's a very difficult topic to be honest. And now when we are focusing on the template glazing, so you have to deal with the pre-stress problem but the good thing is that once it crack initiation then you can assume all the wall collapse right you can assume a new vent is formed so it's kind of easier than fluid gliding actually but but the pre-stress is much more complicated. So it's very difficult to develop a model of this. But now we are focused on these areas, and we eventually develop a numerical model, but it's still under the validation of bio-relevance. And do you have any experience with laminated glass? Because it is commonly used in Poland. They would use, I think it's float glass, but with a layer of plastic foil on one side. Can you maybe tell us more about that? Yes, we indeed conduct agreements about the limited glass. But for limited glass, it's much more expensive than the single one. So before research, you have to consider the expense. But if you can, the advance, so of course, then the glass is a better way to give the better fire resistance. Because from our experiments, even the both glass cracks, even for the float glass, I mean, for nebular glass, they still can seal together with a PVB layer or some materials. Yeah, so it's very difficult to fail out for this kind of glazing. And you have to make the PVB charring and even melting, but difficult actually, so that the glass can fail out. My experience is also that for laminated glass, I've seen like the cracks propagates through the glazing like a spider's web, but it would still stay in place. It would become soft. You could punch it with your hand and move the glass, not break, but move it. It may crater inside, but not break through, but it would not fall out. So in the end, you have the world in which there are literally three different mechanisms like float glass, where you would have cracks propagate and open islands in the glass, and parts of the glass will fall out, and you will have the glass exposed to fire from both sides, so this will quickly lead to more of the glass cracking and failing, and more and more and more. Eventually, the glass will completely fall off. You have tempered glass, which is much more resistant to heat, but once you pass the critical temperature, I don't know, some critical... Temperature difference. Yeah, temperature difference. Temperature gradient inside the glass. Once you pass that point, you have the cracks, you can assume the whole thing breaks out because of the release of the stress within the glass and then you have laminated glass which acts like float so you have the islands of cracks but they don't fall off they they stay sticks to the to the foil membrane until the foil membrane is destroyed did i get that correctly yes yes i think you're very, very correct. Yeah, that's really cool. In Poland, I see this, especially laminated and tempered glass, I see them used together in projects. Like we often have, in recent projects for tall buildings that I had, we had three-layered glazing. First, there was the laminated glass. Then there was some argon layer, like a part of the window filled with argon gas. Then there was a middle section which had some special foils to reflect infrared and ultraviolet light to improve the thermal properties of the inside. And then the outermost layer was tempered glass because probably of its resistance to stress and forces. So in essence, we had three glaze panels between the interior and the exterior. And they were also not made from like a single, it was not a single layer of glass. The laminated one was like three or four glutes together. The same in the middle, it was two of them glued together. So in the end, you literally have multiple layers of glazing on your way out. How do you deal with that problem in your modeling? Are you modeling just one layer or you're modeling all the layers and stresses in all of them separately? Yeah, actually you have to evaluate some other factors. For example, you have to know the heat transfer analysis for the laminated glazing. You have to validate the temperature inside it and also the ambition side of the glazing. We have done that. So I think the FEM method will do this work. And then after you get the temperature and temperature gradient, I think then you can know when the glazing can break. And after that, we have to understand more about the PUAV properties. And actually, for this kind of glazing, I do not think it may fall out very easily in a normal compartment of fire. Not easy, but that way it can fail out. We also have done some double-layer or three double layer or three layer. I mean, not about PVB, but by some airspace. The fail out actually the primary caused by the frame deformation. Yeah, you have to focus on your attention to these areas. For example, we have down to full scale elements. I mean, we build, we burn two real compartments in China, my group. So actually the glass fall out, which is caused by the PVC glass frame. You know, PVC can even burn in the fire. So when the structure loss is stability, so then the flame with the glass would totally fall out. I think this often happens in real fire. Yes, but in the previous research, we did not consider the flame constrained a lot. But, you know, in Edinburgh, David and I were supervising a master's student together. That student had done very good master's thesis that is about the... His name is Parisis from poland and have very clever guy so he has done the you know the combination of the fire and also the deformation from a frame and the impact of both impacts together on the on the glass pad so that will give you a very different breakage magnesium. Yeah. So I think for the case you mentioned, I think we can focus more about the frame and also more about the PVB properties. Yeah. I remember one experiment we were doing, like a full-scale experiment, and I am known for notorious sticking of my iPhone into fire experiments, trying to record. I've got my hand burned like five times already. And my hand is much more fragile than the iPhone is. And there was this window. We had a full compartment fire, like fully flashed over compartment fire. And there was a window frame in that room. And they really, really, really wanted to capture on a video how the glass breaks and falls off. And I was standing there like an idiot, you know, for like good three or four minutes next to a fully flashed over compartment waiting for this damn glass to break. And what happened was exactly what you said. It was not the glass that would break. I mean, I could see like the layers inside crack. I could hear it cracking. But on my end, on my side, on the outside, I could not see cracks. You could hear them, but you could not see them. It was like dark inside and so on. So in the end... So is it three-layer glazing? It was multiple-layer glazing. I don't remember how many. Okay, okay. At least three, maybe even more, because it was for some sort of very energy efficient housing. So for these projects, you use multiple, multiple layers of basing. It was not a skyscraper. It was just a normal window. Eventually, the gaskets, the rubber gaskets have failed. The frame melted a bit and then the whole thing slide off. And the glass was like, ah, it was horrible. I really wanted to capture the glass breaking and what I saw was glass falling. But that is an interesting behavior as well because suddenly you open the whole window, not a part of the window like in the fault glass scenario that was mentioned previously. So maybe we'll move to the fire side. So you've mentioned you now researched blazing failure in connection with compartment fire dynamics. Maybe you can bring up the audience in line on why would we care about blazing failures in fires? Why is it so important for the fire dynamics? for the fire dynamics? Yes, actually, it's also a good question. Actually, in a lot of previous research, when we do compartment fire, we often assume there are no glass pans in the compartment, right? We just assume a flash over already happened, the glass probably gone. But actually, in a real fire, especially in a pirate building fire with modern tempered glass or lancet glass, they are there even after flash over so you cannot simply assume they are gone and so we have to understand how and why it falls out because once it falls out the new air will enter the compartment to give more oxygen to the fuel especially in the in the ventilation control stage of the compound fire and also you know when the glass break at four hours is it gives a new path for the flange spread it can suddenly change the flange spread direction maybe to the facade and the harass building the combustion facade and also maybe it can give the smoke a lot of possibility to go to the other floors or the other rooms, which will cause much more death. So I think, so that's why this is important. Because before you understand this, it's difficult to give the prediction for real fire threat in you know high parallel buildings or in our normal modern buildings yeah so i think we have to learn these areas and because i think because primary because the modern gas is so tough to break so it may not break out the flash over so you have to know even after flash you will when it may break and how it can happen so that's why we started this area in recent years uh primarily you know especially for some parallel buildings the glass facade areas is a lot of glass facade areas so once the glass fall out the the component farm may suddenly change it from ventilation control to fuel control fire uh but in our previous maybe 30 years old maybe no problem. The windows are always small, but now people like big windows. So it can change the opening factor much more significantly. So I think we have to learn these areas. In the very, very far past ago, you would rely on something like a standard time-temperature relation for designing your structure. Well, you still do, but that was the only understanding of the fully developed fire back then. Eventually we got the compartment fire models which connect the size of the fire with the amount of air available through opening factors like you mentioned, the ratio of the part of the building that is open to the surface of the structure inside, more or less. That's not an accurate description, but that's the physical meaning of it. And now, if you want to understand the temperature in your compartment, you need to know this opening factor. You need to understand how much air is available through entrainment into the compartment and how much can go outside of the compartment from the fire. And we often, when you would design a building, you would know the area of your windows or area of glazed. And you could mistakenly assume that all of it is empty, that you have the maximum possible open factory because everything fell out, which may be the case after a few hours of your fire, like an hour or two hours, when you have exposed this glazing for the maximum temperature for a long time, it could fall out actually. And it could be a description of the maximum biggest fire you can have in that room. fire you can have in that room. But if you have a fire that is growing, a fire that is building up and transitions to flashover, it has the whole glazing closed. Now, a good question is, are the conditions in that early stage of the fire sufficient to break the glass easily? And easily and in what amount do you have any experience in like pre-flash over fires destroying glazing or opening this new flow paths or it has to be like it must be conditions like in a fully flash over fire to destroy this modern glazing yes uh we have done some small scale improvements and also i've done some full scale for thescale elements, when the tempered glass totally falls out, you can see that the ejected flame is very big. I mean, suddenly, maybe three times bigger than the normal ejected flame. So I think suddenly, maybe during only one or three seconds, but this is already a very big threat for the fire spread. I think this is a very interesting thing. And, you know, it also can, when the glass breaks, it can also change the distribution of heat flux. That means, in the room, that means your structure will be subject to very different heating conditions before and after the glass fallout. So I think that's a very interesting thing. But for the fourth scale, like you said, last year we have conducted two fourth scale burns. One is there is no window and no door. We just burn the furniture and the fire just develops at the normal stage, the early stage, and the flash over and something. But it's only, but it actually is only as a borderline to make a flash over happen. But you know what? After we furnished the glass panel and the door, yeah, and during the fire, we closed the window and closed the door. Then we ignited the room. And something interesting happens. And the fire develops first, and then, ignited the room and something interesting happens and the fire develops first and then due to lack of the oxygen the fire kind of self-extinguish and also it may cause the jack path if you open a door on a window but so the room is in the with the temperature of more than 400 degrees for more than 10 minutes so it maybe there are some smoldering on the bed or on the sofa. And what is interesting is that even the smoldering fire at last makes the glass crack and makes the fail to happen. So after a while, then the fire becomes much bigger than the test wet after the flash over. So that's also a very interesting phenomenon, that it even makes the fire bigger, if you install the glass, and the glass, if the glass fades out at some point. For me, an interesting topic is the natural ventilation of offices, and we were also doing, we're doing a lot of research in that field. I'm not sure how it is used in China, but in Poland in particular, we see a lot of natural ventilation even in very tall buildings because it gives many points in the green certificates, you know, LEED, BREEAM. You get many points for having access to natural ventilation. And it's not that you have a whole panes of glass opened in the facade. It's more like you have these narrow panels, maybe 20 centimeters wide, which you can open. And they're like closed with a porous steel mesh outside. So you cannot even put your hand, but you can let some air inside. You cannot even put your hand, but you can let some air inside. So I think even in such conditions, when you have some sort of ventilation for the compartment, like natural ventilation, it would be very difficult to oxygen starve the fire like in your case. But it would still be not enough to develop into fully flashed over fire in a compartment. So it would be even closer to the conditions you've mentioned with the smoldering. It would be some flaming combustion adding to the energy. So you could have this, let's say, pre-flash over temperatures for a very pre-long time in your compartment. And the second thing that comes to my mind, if you think about the traveling fire methodology that is commonly used now to design offices in large buildings, it pre-assumes that parts of your compartment are preheated by the fire that is far away. We have a fire that is far away, but the smoke is covering the whole compartment. So you still, even though the fire may be far away, you still have your glazing exposed to some high temperature from the smoke anyway before the fire comes. So these are two scenarios that come to my mind thinking about how pre-flash over fire can create damage to the glaze. And did you try to burn to a window destroy that window? You mean directly put a window? Like you have a window in your building and you put a sofa next to the window and you burn the sofa. So you consider the fire of that item, not the fire of the compartment. Will that be sufficient to destroy a tempered glazed window? Okay. We do not burn this, but we do a profile just beside the glass. Okay. Yeah, similar condition. It's like an ambitious condition. Yeah, it can make the float glass crack. Yeah, not tempered, but it's kind of difficult to make the tempered glazing crack. Especially if you have multi layers. Yeah, it has layers. I think it's very difficult for the open condition. Understood. I also wonder if you reverse the problem. When you discuss the separation between buildings or how fragile a building is to a wildland fire, for example, we often consider how easy it is for the fire to get into the compartment from outside. So I wonder also, like, if you reverse the perspective, I guess, because the windows are harder to break, they have better thermal properties, they have infrared reflective foils inside of them, they must be also much better in protecting the building from the fire that is outside or on a separate building. Have you had any experience with that? So yes, when you put the fire inside a compartment, that is a harassed building fire, urban fire. But when you put the fire, you know why we did the fire and just put maybe a full fire just beside the window because we want to stimulate the the wi situation yeah so i think the radiation is the primary way to make it a break and as i mentioned in the interview that i think also the the frame material is already important because you are subject to the firebrand issues. So if the window is closed, I do not think the firebrand may make the glass break. But it may ignite the PVC window frame or wooden window frame. Yeah, especially I think I know at the fire, but in China, we don't use the wooden frame a lot. But in Europe and in America, especially in the W.R. areas, people like to use wooden fray. So I think this is very important to make sure that make the glass safety, to make the window safety. And in terms of radiation being able to penetrate the glasses, is it still like the outermost layer that would be the most exposed or maybe some? Because you often use the shading foils inside of the compartment we are not fully transparent to shade a bit or to reflect infrared radiation and this would not be used or is it used on the external i'm not completely sure on the technology maybe it's used on the external layer of glass. But do you see a different, for example, temperature gradients inside the glazing in this scenario, or is it the same? I think they are similar because the maximum temperature difference often occurs just at the borderline between the covered areas. I mean, frame covered and the frame exposed areas. So no matter if it's inside or outside, I think the maximum temperature difference is at that point. So the crack often initiates in the middle of the edge. It's often at the edge. So I think there are no big difference between the inside and outside. And a stupid question, if you have half of the window shaded, like if the radiation hits only half of the window and the half is in the shade because you had a corner or something will that create a temperature gradient that can also be more difficult for the glass to handle yes it is a very clever question yeah if you change the shade the forms it may change the correct location i guess. We also done some numerical simulation about this. We try to give a shadow, a new triangle. So that will be different. But the best thing is that, you know, when we change the installation or change the shade forms of the glazing, we found that, you know, if there's a hidden frame, no glass frame, then we do not make it break. frame, no glass frame, then we do not make it break. But there are no such big temporary difference when it's subject to a fire. There's no frame, for example, you are just hitting the glass. Yeah, so I think maybe this is some way to prevent the crack. I'm just imagining it. Because in Harrods buildings, they are hidden frames we see them a lot, yes but the problem is the glue the suction glue between the glass and the metal area and in the description of your previous experiment you've mentioned the glass was exposed to approximately 400 degrees for like 10 minutes that is a lot of temperature in my school of engineering how I was told you could assume that the glass will fail at 300 degrees maybe 250 you can see some cracks i wonder do you have numbers of what temperature to assume for this glazing to fail or it's too complicated and you need to go um fem modeling yeah actually the engineering, I think you can assume it's critical condition for crack. And actually the factor for glass break is the temperature difference. I mean, temperature grade rather than the temperatures. So even though the room temperature is for me, maybe 500 degrees or 900 degrees, but you cannot say what temperature it is on the glazing and what temperature difference. So you have to measure the temperature difference on the glass surface so that you can determine, okay, it may crack or not. So you have to assume that. Yeah, I think room temperature. I think glass crack in a very wide range of room temperatures because room temperature is not the critical factor for its break. And in your modeling, do you now have a way to couple this into the simulation? Because if I model my compartments in FDS, one way to do the glass breaking, you would set a device with a temperature trigger on it. And once this temperature is met, the glass would disappear and the wall would open. That is a common way we do this in CFD modeling. You think at this point it's the correct way or more sophisticated models are needed? And if so, do you see these models be created and implemented in FDS in future? Yes, I think. Because now, a lot of my students are doing, you know, something you mentioned with FDS, you know, once the temperature reaches some point, or the heat flux reaches some point, you know, it just removes the panel. It disappears. It disappears. So, yeah, it can simulate some environment phenomena, but it's difficult for you to match the environment results. I mean, breaking time and the breaking time in the numerical simulation, very difficult. So I think FDS cannot predict very well for the glass breakage. But we need some more specific and some more complex modeling, I guess. So actually you can also, actually that is similar to the structure fire areas. You know, you get the temperature distribution of the glazing, and then you do the FEM analysis, in another solid sulfur. Then you add the crack, you know, the quick condition, then it changes. So I think the value is very similar to structure, structure fire. It's interesting. Like, if you have just the float glass or just a single layer of tempered glass, I mean, this approach you've mentioned or I've mentioned would be okay-ish to model that, you know, if you have just one layer. But if you have multilayer glass, especially with the air zones inside the glazing, so it makes a very complicated thermal boundary condition inside. I mean, FDS has this 1D and 3D heat transfer models inside, so you could technically solve for that, but it could be interesting to have a glass boundary condition that you could put and software would know it's layers of glass that will break at this temperature gradient. And it could know that, okay, now one, two, three layers have failed. The fourth layer is exposed. Okay, now it broke completely, one two three layers have failed the fourth layer is exposed okay now it broke completely disappeared the element that that would be an interesting development maybe you guys with developing your models will be able to to build something like that are you yeah this is what we are doing actually you know i got a project from the start of this year so we have to focus on these areas that range is actually we hope you know we don't want to make things very complicated you know we want to understand the complicated issue and make these things very simple to be used so we hope you know even in the current fds if we do some assumption or some simplification that we still can kind of accurately, I mean, in an acceptable way, the practice of the glass breakage. So I think that's also very cool because, you know, the computation time is also another factor we have to consider. We make, you know, single glazing. So a lot of things to, I think that's not very efficient in the engineering. So we want to make the things as simple as possible, but in an accurate way. I also think the coupling outside and inside, like back and forth would be difficult because so far I know it is fairly easy or very easy to extract from FDS to FEM models. I just had Thomas Cherne on the podcast and he was talking about Saphir, how it does this extraction of the data that there's already a model built in FDS to help that extraction. But if you extract to another software and then would like to come back to FDS with the information, okay, now it broke and destroyed the window. I think it is quite difficult at this point. Are you working with other numerical models as well besides FDS or this would be development for or it's just unrelated to software, it's just a third party model outside of any CFD? Yeah, because we have in-house software for crack so maybe we get this temperature and then we can get it practiced in our in-house software. But this is still undergoing, so the students are trying to compare the results with the experiments to modify. Numerical simulation often needs a lot of assumption or a lot of time to be validated. Yeah, so we are doing this. Very good. Maybe just as a final question, how do you see the near future of glazing? Is there any new technologies emerging that will change everything in the next 10 years, like the tempered and laminated glass changed the last years, or we are now in a stable region and just slowly improving the technology? What the future holds? Actually, I checked this area as a boundary condition on the fire dynamical problem. So we do not uh you know focus too much on the glass technology so we cannot predict what kind of new glass can appear yeah or maybe yeah but what we can predict is as the glass will be used as more often and more widely much more widely in the future because i think it's similar to the you know people are like using the timber building because timber make you feel very natural and very very nice the glass as well i can say in china you know many buildings are using much much more grazing even the channel of the floors and uh you five years ago, they likely used concrete, but people like to use glass everywhere. So I think glass may be much more widely used in the future. I think this is more important than previous years. This is what we can see. Sorry, I told you there would be two questions, but it's like now the question number seven. But it is so interesting. We also have these double-skin facades where you would have a facade of the building, then let's say one two-meter cavity, very large cavity, and like an external covering facade. I guess in this WUI scenario, you'd also be very good because you would have this frontal panel that can take the heat and did you have an experience with this type of facades yes i think the problem for this kind of dark skin is this the smoke movement rather than the glass breakage it's more about the flow dynamics. Yeah. So the smoke entering the cavity between the facade and the second skin. Yeah. So only if you have where the fire happened, if the fire happened in the room. So after it break the window, so the smoke can go out. But I don't think it's very easy to break the glass in the upper floor. I think the problem is the smoke may go up and maybe enter the other. As I said, you can have natural openings in Poland in these buildings. So you have a natural opening through which the smoke could re-enter the building, creating a very dangerous dynamics. This is actually something to consider with that. That should be a podcast episode. I'll note that down. I need to find a double-skinned facade expert now. That's so cool. Okay. And for the end, we have talked something about the future technologies. And one future technology that I see developing is different approaches to create energy generation within glass panels, like embed some sort of silicon foils or perovskite foils inside to generate electricity within the glazing. And I don't expect an answer, but I think this could be also a thing that changes the way how facades are built, used, and how they behave in fire. Do you have an opinion on these new technologies? Do you mean the PV panel? Yeah, but even like PV panels, when you put them on a facade, that's one topic. And I see that happening. I know there was like one building in China which had like the whole facade of the building covered with PV and that was amazing. It was an insane generation of energy. But I read in like pop science magazines that they would like to embed the the pv inside the glass like a foil inside okay so it would be a part of the glazing you would probably not even see the the foil being in there so you could cover the whole building with this uh type of foils and panels yeah yeah actually this is the new research direction in my group. So I think the substantial issue is a glass breakage issue. Actually, what you mentioned is similar to denture cleaning, right? It's similar, okay, so similar challenges. I also wonder how we will handle all the cables inside the facade structure, especially if it's PVC. I see a risk with the cables and energy transport and firefighting operations on facades that are under electricity. So that is a whole array of challenges emerging. Yeah, it's much more complex. It's much more complex. Okay. This is very insightful. I look forward for the work of USTC in the field of FASAD and every other field that you're researching. I know your group at your laboratory is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in the fire science. So I'm really happy that the fire science show finally came to China and had the guests from the biggest group out there. Yeah, congratulations on what you are doing and all the best for the future. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Wojciech. Thank you for your participation. Thank you for the audience for listening. Yeah, I will show this, I think it's a very good show. I will show it to the colleagues and the students in our State Key Fire Lecture. And that's it. Thank you for listening and thank you for coming to the Fireside Show and telling us all about the glazing in fires. It was certainly a very interesting and packed with information episode. I could not extract a single number from you on what temperature the fire will break the glass. I guess we have to stick to the literature reviews. And he has written some great papers. I'll cite them in the episode show notes so you can unravel. I really enjoyed talking to him. I really enjoyed the research they were doing and developments they were doing at the USTC, especially the ones related to creating new models. If we could get a glass breakage model that we could implement somehow into FDS or other CFD cases that are being used and just have a glass boundary condition, and just have the software figure out at what point the glass will break, crack, fall off, and what extent that fall off will be. We would enter a whole new level of modeling. Today, we are doing that in a very simple manner by creating devices, opening parts of the model as soon as certain temperatures are reached i mean it works it's better than nothing but i think thanks to models like the ones created by you steam we can really up this game and really improve our modeling skills and make these simulations more realistic and if we couple that with models that use real fuels, they use ignition, solid phase, pyrolysis, combustion, they just model the fire actually. If you couple that with a really good model for ventilation conditions, we are closer and closer to modeling real compartment fires in our CFD and that's a beautiful direction. Atmosfires in our CFD, and that's a beautiful direction. And as soon as I see something emerging in the field that brings us closer to this solution and that helps us understand real fires better, you may be sure I'll bring it into the podcast. And that would be it for today's episode. I also hope it will let me reach some new listeners in China. I really hope for that. Let me reach some new listeners in China. I really hope for that. You have promised me to share this episode with their internal mainland channels and help to spread the word about the podcast. I really hope to find new listenership in China where I did not have that money. And that would be great news for the podcast, reaching more engineers and more scientists around the world. And as usual, if you know an engineer, if you know a fire scientist, you know a firefighter, or anyone else who could benefit from listening to the FireSense show, please let them know that the show exists. Yeah, and thank you for listening. See you here next week, next Wednesday. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
