Word of mouth is still number one way for podcasts to get shared. And maybe your colleagues don't know they have a podcast app in their phone. Maybe you have to just steal the phone and put the fire science show name in it and play it to them. So they finally join us in here. Maybe don't be that brutal, but I would really appreciate if you help me spreading the word about the podcast. Because the more people people listening the more people we can help and have more people with us on this journey into the fire science and also i really appreciate the donations you can donate to the podcast through the podcast website there's buy me coffee button where you can drop a few euros to the show all of the donations go to supporting the podcast paying for my my hosting, mastering, editing software, and so on, so on. So if you would like to support me in this way, I would appreciate that. And anyway, I really appreciate you being here and listening to the show because I'm doing it for you, and I'm really happy that you are here with me. So for the episode today, it's actually a comeback to the podcast. I'm hosting again Professor Guillermo Reyn from Imperial College London. Guillermo was my first guest in the podcast that I've ever interviewed and we've talked about pit fires and today we're going to talk again about fires, this time fires in buildings and a very particular type of fire which is called the traveling fire. So first, let me introduce you to the traveling fires. There is a thing in fire science that's called the compartment fire dynamics, or the compartment fire theory. It was pioneered by Cavagoa and Thomas, then written in handbooks by Drysdale, Quintieri, Carlson. And it's something that we are being taught learning fire science in our universities. This theory is about how fire grows in compartments and how the physics dictates the size of the fire, how it can go into either fuel control or ventilation control, what's the maximum size of it, and so on, so on. But there is a very profound limitation to this theory, and it's related to the size of the compartment. Because the method assumes that the temperatures in a smoke layer or in the compartment as a whole are more or less unified. And once you have a large compartment and the fire is localized, it does not cover the whole compartment, then you start having gradients of temperatures. The theory breaks down in a bit. For many years, it was not considered as a big issue because we commonly assumed that a flash over the fire in a small compartment where you have the maximum temperatures is the absolutely worst case scenario you could have in a building. But after fires such as World Trade Center disaster, this was in a way revisited. And it was found that it's not necessarily always the worst scenario. And sometimes if the fire takes a long time to travel through the compartment, burning it part by part, it can lead to much worse outcomes than a short and very hot fire in a flashover setting. And this was pretty much the basis for emergence of the traveling fire methodology. Methodology in which the source of the fire is not considered stationary. Instead, you consider two edges of the fire moving through the compartment. The leading edge, so the edge at which the fire ignites new fuel, and the burnout edge, or the the trading edge where the fuel burns out and there's no more fire at that location. And as these two edges move through the compartment, fire is obviously in between them and in a way it travels through the building. And this is a very powerful concept that's a missing link between the localized fire theory and the flash of that fire theory. And in this episode, we're gonna talk a lot more about how this came to life, what were the assumptions of its creators, and how it's being developed today. So I hope you're gonna wildly enjoy this one. I really enjoyed having Guillermo again in my studio. So yeah, let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojcie Guillermo Reyn again. Hey, Guillermo, great to have you back to the show. Hey, thanks for having me again. You're awesome. Just a few months, but it feels like a whole, I don't know, decade has been since last time we've spoken. Well, I see you every week. Oh, that's nice. Thank you, man. I hope you enjoy it. Yeah, it is. It's been since last time we've spoken. Well, I hear you every week. Oh, that's nice. Thank you, man. I hope you enjoy it. Yeah, it is. It's awesome. It's unique and it's very refreshing. And you are making the point that something like this, this podcast was needed. So you are making our field better and larger. Thank you, Bojo. We'll make a statue for you. Nice. Thank you, Roger. We'll make a statue for you. Nice. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's going to be a very fat statue. I would not recommend that. Let's talk about some traveling and it's going to be traveling fires. I'm really happy to see so much happening around on this important subject, including the recent publication of your team led by Dr. Rakauskaita that summarized one of the biggest or the biggest experiment we've done actually together on this subject. And I see some interesting things happening in France. I have my own memories of interesting things that happened in Poland. And I guess it's the time to share this a bit with the listeners. What do you think about this subject? Is it something that really fires you up? This is one of the contributions that we had to the field that I like the most. This is very close to my heart, literally, not just the physical heart, but the professional heart. This is something that I started a long time ago when I was just freshly arrived to the University of Edinburgh. The core of the ideas were developed at Edinburgh, and then the applications and the subsequent improvements and developments were done at Imperial. And we continue doing them. This is a topic that we haven't finished with, not just us. There is still a lot to do on the topic. Maybe you can take me back in time to your early days in Edinburgh, where this was born. And tell me what made you pursue a completely new methodology to define boundary conditions for structural fire engineering. Didn't you like the standard fire curve enough? No, I like it, but not enough. It is important. We are talking about traveling fires. This is a concept that we developed in 2006. I think it was the first paper. Actually, the first time we developed it, it didn't have a name, so it was not Traveling Fires. It was later on named Traveling Fires. It was Barbara Lane from Arup who, in an email exchange, said, those Traveling Fires of yours, Guillermo. I thought, that's a brilliant name. Let's call it Traveling Fires. So the next paper is then they use traveling fires as a name. And now it has catch. And it's not just that it's our work called traveling fires. It's that the standards and many papers by other people and even in meetings, people say you can see the traveling fires. But traveling fires is a broad concept that it just refers to a fire that travels. And some people were saying, what do you mean by travel? What we mean by travel is that it doesn't stay put in one location. It might be large or it might be small, but it's moving across the compartment. And that concept, just that it's moving, it is a departure from what structural engineers have been assuming for the last 200 years. As you know, structural engineers have a duty to design buildings that don't collapse because of gravity, because of wind, because of earthquakes, because of tsunamis, because of snow storms, and also because of fire, right? So they have a duty to assume what is the fire that they are more concerned about for multiple reasons. They have to reach an agreement with the authorities and the clients sometimes about this. And when they decide what is the scenario they want to design, I guess, then they make the structure be strong enough against that scenario. And for many, many years and decades, actually even centuries, structural engineers have been assuming, it's an hypothesis actually, that the worst-case scenario in a structure, in a compartment, is what we call flashover. And flashover is when absolutely every single piece of fuel that could burn is burning. That's what it means. And it has different ways of being expressed. It has different ways of being measured. It has many different ways of being studied. But it really means that everything that could burn is burning. Not that everything has burned in the past or will burn in the future. No, no. That everything, it is burning in that particular moment. So every structural engineer said, well, that's pretty bad. Firefighters are very concerned about this. We have seen some structures failing when flashover had taken place. Therefore, flashover is the worst that can happen. And this is an assumption that was not checked for a very, very long time. And the origin of traveling fires is when it actually started in 2001, after the horrible attacks of the World Trade Center. millions of people saw that the fires that were started by the aircraft and that then were burning the office of the World Trade Center, everybody saw that the fire was not in one place. Everybody saw that the fire was traveling. And obviously that led to the investigation and it led to many things. So Jos√© Toredo, a professor in fire engineering at that time at Edinburgh, he was actually the professor in the group where I was, he himself thought, oh, that's very interesting. He was involved in litigation regarding the Waltry Center. And there was an ongoing discussion with the lawyers and other technical matter about what happens if the fire moves and if the fire doesn't move. And he thought, that's an interesting idea. We need to look into this. And I thought, that is absolutely brilliant. Jose, you're absolutely right. But I could not be involved in the litigation. That was on the side. So we said, okay, let's work on this as a research topic. We came out with the first paper where we said, what happens to the heating to the structure? We were just, we're not doing a structural response. We were saying, how much does the heat, the structure made of steel, heats up if the fire is moving compared to a flashover? And the first thing that we saw is like, actually, it gets hotter if the fire is allowed to move than if you assume a flashover fire. And we started to travel the world, literally, with these findings, conferences. And we had plenty of interactions. It was amazing. It was a paper that it not left anyone in the audience in silence. People were horrified by the things that we were saying. People were fascinated by the things that we were saying. And people were in agreement or in disagreement. But it did not leave anyone neutral and we realized that there was a need to continue looking into the topic so we developed more research and we started to develop models that are able to create scenarios that structural engineers can then use and and then we started to look not just at thermal temperature response, not just how much the steel or the concrete heats up, but actually what would be the structural response if this is in a building with multiple floors and the fire is traveling horizontally or vertically, and we continue doing this. And now the latest piece of work that actually a paper that was accepted today with ADOP and a paper that was accepted today with Adub and a paper that was accepted two months ago are experiments. Experiments that we have conducted on the specific objective of seeing, observing in detail a fire that had trouble. That's an interesting journey from an idea, very clever and one that really immediately changes your perception of what you see right it's this type of a powerful concept at some point i've wondered what traveling fire is really about is it understanding the physics of a fire is it understanding the manifestation of the physics of the fire is it just a clever way for a structural engineer to really expose his structure to the worst thing or maybe a bit of all of the three above? It is all of the three. Obviously, me specifically, being an expert in heat transfer and a person that really likes fire dynamics, I enjoy understanding why a fire would trouble. And if it does, how it would trouble. But that is not the only reason why we should study traveling fires although i have a bias on this it is from my point of view absolutely essential for a structural engineer because it means that the worst case scenario for their structure is not just a standard fire or a flashover fire. That sometimes, and this is uncontroversial in the sense that it has been shown numerically and experimentally, that the worst case scenario for a structure could be, it's not guaranteed to be, but it could be a traveling fire. That means that a structural engineer cannot say, well, I just don't feel like looking into this just because, I don't know, I just, I don't speak good English. So therefore I'm going to assume that it's a flashover. Like, well, okay, that's, that someone might allow you to do this, but that's not good enough. If you are really looking forward to your structure being robust enough, you might want to look into the possible worst case scenario that could be a traveling fire. So there are many engineers around the world right now that are using traveling fires as a possible scenario to challenge their structure. And when they have done it, they have shown that sometimes the worst-case scenario is a traveling fire. Sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's actually quite interesting. Structurally speaking, specifically, the worst-case scenario sometimes is a steel flashover fire type of behavior, right? In Eurocode or something like this. But sometimes it's not. And we don't know enough in the sense that no one can say at the outset in any compartment what is going to be the worst case scenario. Unfortunately, we have to go by hand and look at them. And there is not just one traveling fire, the bad news, and people don't like it for that, is that it doesn't exist one traveling fire. We recognize this was another contribution that we had. We recognize a family of possible fires. We don't know if they're going to be fast or slow. We don't know if they're going to be big or large. But they are going to be traveling across the compartment. And we made a link that the fastest fires will be larger. The slower fires will be smaller. That's actually dictated by physics. And then we just ask the structural engineers to look into the family of fires, not just one fire. And it's not necessarily, well it's never the same fire that will be the worst for all structures. In one structure it will be one, in another it will be other, right? Indeed, definitely. It's a structure, it's compartment has its own worst case scenario. But what we found, and we don't know why yet, and this is actually a mathematical problem more than a physical problem. What we see is that the worst-case scenario tends to be in relatively small fires, which are relatively fast. They're actually in percentage of the floor area. What we see is that between 10% to 15% of the floor area, when a traveling fire is that size and is traveling across the compartment, that leads to the largest heating of the structure, being steel, concrete, or timber. That's what we've seen. Mathematically, someone at some point will look into why that is happening, but it's a balance between the highest temperatures, which are produced by the flame, being long enough, and that then the smoke, which is preheating and post-heating, is therefore long enough as well. And the combination between the flames and the smoke leads to a larger temperature. So with these percentages and the way how you define these traveling fires, if I understand it correctly, you can imagine a large room where is the virgin fuel that you will eventually burn, be it desks, wardrobes, whatever is in an open space. And then the fire starts and it eventually spreads forward, igniting more and more fuel, but there is not an infinite amount of fuel behind it. So it burns out as it moves. So it becomes time-related phenomenon. Can the fire live long enough in one space to ignite another space before it burns out? And now the velocity in how the fire will ignite the further things is related to heat transfer, more or less, and ventilation conditions, and very, very complex physics, actually, to calculate how it spreads. Yeah, actually, we can't calculate how it spreads. That's what I wanted to say. We can only assume how they could spread and then look into the consequences. That's what I wanted to say. I mean, if the world was built only from PMMA slabs, maybe we would have a chance. But PMMA is usually found in the fire laboratories, not really that much in open space offices. And it's not an easy way to solve it. So you had to find a proxy for this spread. How did you solve that issue with this methodology? It's a brilliant question and line of recommendation, because there's something that I want to tell you. Oh, first, something to highlight we haven't mentioned yet. We know that traveling fires appear or traveling or the fire wants to travel when the compartment is large. Okay. If the compartment is small, and they always ask me how small, we don't know, but we think that it's going to be smaller than 100 meters square. So for example, my office is definitely the fire is not going to travel. So if someone is interested in the structural response of the environment in my office, just let them know that it is not going to be a traveling fire, and a flashover fire is going to be okay, and it's going to be the worst case scenario. But when you start to move in open plan offices and large spaces where there is few, the structural engineers, because of inherited and the legacy training that they receive, they immediately said, worst case scenario is a flashover. But if you ask other fire people, for example, a forest fire expert, they will tell you, we rarely see anything similar to the concept of a flashover. Only in a valley, they would see something like this. What we see, they will tell you a forest person, we always see the fire spreading. And there is a leading edge where the flame is igniting the next fuel element and is moving forward. And behind, there is what we call the trailing edge, which is when all the fuel that has been burning for about 20 minutes already, actually there is no more fuel and the flames stop. And between the leading edge and the trailing edge, you have a fire of some size that is traveling. And the size of the fire could actually vary. Sometimes it could be large, sometimes it could be small, because it depends on the interplay of the velocity of the leading edge and the velocity of the trailing edge. So the two edges are unrelated to each other, but they are related to the fuel that is burning by flammability properties and by fuel load. So the two of them, that's why you can end up with a large fire or you can end up with a small fire related to a slow fire or to a fast fire. And how did you proxy it? Like, what did you do to solve the unsolvable problem of physics of the fire spread? Because to model it you need a number. So yeah no it's a very good question and this is when the different schools of thought will have different answer to that question right? So a physicist or a computational scientist will tell you, you obviously take the 3D development, Navier-Stokes equations, Arrhenius equations, and you couple all through Fourier's law and Stefan Bonsman's law, and you push enter, and you spend three months, and you will have a special distributed model of how the fire spreads. Obviously, that's possible. As an engineer, I could do that. that's possible. As an engineer, I could do that. But what I prefer to do is to produce something that can be used by the people who design buildings, the structural engineers. So I want my research, this is an aspiration, it doesn't happen often, but I want my research, our research, to be used in the real environment so I actually can sleep better at night thinking that I did my tiny little son bit into having a safer world somewhere. And that means that if I come out with a 3D, fully transient, fully physics model of the whole enclosure, it's not going to be used by engineers. So what I did is we spent a significant amount of time into studying how engineers were using design scenarios. using design scenarios. And we saw that they were going straight into flashover and they were using either the standard fire, which is cheating because the standard fire doesn't ever end. It could be an infinite fire. Infinite fires don't exist in nature. Or the one that is very popular that we use a lot for our comparisons is the Eurocode. The Eurocode used mostly in the UK, actually. Which is really funny, but it's very popular in the uk it has the parametric fires which are fires that are not infinite which makes me very happy because i believe in conservation of energy and conservation of mass and these fires could be hot and short or could be cold and long or in between it creates the concept of a family of fires it's not embraced by most engineers but they were actually the first ones to say, we just don't know which one. We just know there's going to be a range of them. And we look into that, right? And we realize, so they take one temperature in the whole compartment. The compartment has thousands of temperature points, but they say, just take one, the average or the most representative one, and that is heating the structure. And actually they do the heat transfer in a relatively nice way. They assume a heat transfer coefficient, which is not in a value that is relatively acceptable or which you can do better. It assumes re-radiation and it just solves for the heat transfer into the steel or the concrete or the timber. the steel or the concrete or the timber. And we thought, okay, so let's take that structure and alter as little as possible, but allowing traveling fires to come in. So if we come out with 27 temperatures changing in time and space, the structural engineer cannot use them. We will have to wait 20 years for them to be ready. So we said is remove that one single temperature by one temperature that at the beginning is not too hot is this arriving a smoke to the location then at some point it goes really hot which is the arrival of the flames and then it goes down again to the smoke because now the fire has burned whatever the fuel is under this structure element has moved away and then now just focusing for how long is the smoke preheating? For how long is the flames heating? And for how long is the posterior heating after the flames? And this is for different locations in your building. So you would calculate this for like, I don't know, the slab next to the fire, the slab 10 meters away, the slab 20 meters away. And each of them would have their own. In reality, there is a possibility different points of the compartment will see the arrival of the smoke and the flames at different times. It would end up in different final heating. What we saw very quickly is that it is true that the final maximum temperature, not the final temperature, the maximum temperature, which is one thing that the structural engineers like to look at. Obviously, as a mechanical engineer, expert in heat transfer, I love the concept of maximum temperature because it's something that I can calculate. And I love things that I calculate. But in reality, a structural engineer needs to focus on the structural response, not on the thermal response. And when the structural engineers start to do complex calculations on the structure, that is away from my expertise. So they have my full admiration and they will always have my collaboration to work on this. But I encourage them not to stop at the temperature, which is where I should work. They should go into the structural part. But anyway, so talking about something that I can say more about is the temperature, the maximum temperature in different parts of a compartment. the temperature, the maximum temperature in different parts of a compartment, it is relatively similar in all places, but it tends to be higher at the end of the compartment. But because we don't know where the arsonist or the accident is going to happen, we don't know what is the concept of the end of the compartment because we just don't know where it's going to start. So therefore, you run a traveling fire and you always look into the maximum temperature towards the end. And you use that temperature of the steel or the concrete or the timber as the requirement or the challenge to your structure. So coming back a little earlier, you've said that when you were developing the methodology, the concept of flashover was very strong and we see today that we perceive the fires as flashovered fires or pre-flashovered fires. Usually the flashover is the point where the fire dynamics change and this has some historical background going back to the 50s where the first single zone models were developed or even earlier where people were just assuming that the flashover fire is the fire. Everything else was a small fire. So now we enter to this moment when we figure out, okay, maybe this flashover scenario is not the most onerous one or maybe you're even entering discussion if a flashover in a given compartment can even occur. Because if you use MQH correlation, McCaffrey-Quintier-Harkload, that allows you to calculate what heat release rate essentially you need in a compartment to create a flashover, you sometimes don't have a solution for that in a given compartment. So now, on the other hand, you have the whole world of fire resistance, the whole world that is very juxtaposed to the post-flash over fire. It is the post-flash over fire world. And suddenly, we are talking about the physics of real fires in the building. And it's interesting. But when you compare that with very unrealistic way, how we create the proxy of safety through fire resistance concepts, for example, do you think that this needs to be changed? Like the whole world of fire resistance should change to adapt for use in traveling fires? Or maybe the traveling fires can penetrate the world of fire resistance in a way. Is there a link? Can we find one? So it is happening and it's definitely happening slowly, but it is happening with our lifetime. I'm happy to say that traveling far now is in the Euro code, it's in the ISO and it's in the British standard. And it's just a matter of time for it to also be in the Society of Fire Protection Engineers and other codes. So it is happening that now is part of the standards. It's not just that there are many papers on it, computational, theoretical, and experimental. It's that it's already in the world of design. And I know, because I'm a, well, I used to know, I used to be updated with the number of buildings around the world that have used traveling fires. Not that they were designed against a traveling fire, but that the engineering team had considered if a traveling fire was the worst. And it was sometimes, sometimes it was not. And they were all beautiful buildings. Literally, they were all iconic. They were not like cheap buildings that you do at someone that's in a minute. It's a building that people put love and attention and true engineering in. And these type of teams, the ones that aspire to the true engineering calculations, are the teams that are more susceptible to embrace traveling fire as well. So it is happening. Just one thing, you referred to the concept of fire resistance. I really dislike to use the concept of fire resistance as a very, very specific, small definition related to standards and to practice. For me, fire resistance is a combination of two words. That means the resistance against fire. And i think there is a lot of work to do into how many engineers currently design for the resistance against fire but i refuse to assume that those two beautiful words together only mean that they mean also the future of fire resistance yeah i've asked that because it's these concepts are as far from each other as the real fires are from the fire resistance in a way, which is in a way a horrible conclusion to make. But that is the truth. Now we know how the idea was born. We know what triggered it, what were the goals. And now let's fly to Poland and tell me what made you burn a cowhouse in the middle of Poland to prove a point. It was a beautiful, absolutely beautiful work that actually you had a significant input into. And it was very important to have met you. But I'll start with when we were presenting the work, not just at the beginning, as we were progressing and presenting papers. As I told you before, it was very rarely that an audience will stay quiet after hearing about traveling fire especially if i was presenting by the way no i have i have the gift or not of making audience react uh one of the questions that i was getting actually i think is the number one question that they are by the way obviously i didn't do this work by myself quite the, but there are key players in this work. It's not just Jose Torero or Jamie Sten Gottfried that was the first PhD student doing this, or Egle Racascaute, who did another PhD with me at Imperial, or Mohamed Heradi, who did also another PhD thesis on this, and more students that are coming. coming. Altogether, when we were presenting, the number one question that we were getting was, what is a small compartment? What is a large compartment to know when they have to worry about traveling fires, right? And we didn't have a question for that, and we still don't have it. And then the number one complaint, not question, was fires don't travel. We literally hear that very often by some very reputable scientists and engineers, obviously not in front of hundreds of people, but to us and on written, they said, this is bollocks, Guillermo, fires don't trouble. And it was very interesting because if you talk to the fire brigades, they would tell you they hardly go a month in their lifetimes when they don't see a fire troubling. And I thought to myself, what kind of a state of affairs is this? Where some of the luminaries of our field claim that fires don't travel and some of the people at the forefront of fire protection, which is when everything fails and the fire has to be fired, are saying that, of course, they travel. I just don't have time to take measurements for you, Guillermo, because I'm trying to save life, mine included. So we obviously thought there is more work that needs to be done here. And one of the things is, can you show experimentally that fires travel? So the first thing that we did with Jamie is we look into the literature. We actually revisit the literature with a question that no one had ever posed before. Is in this experiment, did the fire travel? And we found we found evidence i think in the figure of five experiments where there was evidence that the fire had traveled there was also lack of comments in the paper about this behavior people were not looking at it people were not interested in at it people were oblivious to the fact that thermocouples were racing up and down almost like in synteny at different times they like, we don't know what this happened. There's a comment that actually in one of them, in a BID test, that says, and we don't like this, we tried to get rid of it, but it just doesn't go away. The fire keeps being in the wrong place, right? It was fascinating. So actually, traveling fires had been observed, but people were blind to it. They were not interested and they were not actually able to see it. Then we obviously recognized the need to do experiments. There was a very large proposal led by Jose Torero that was written here for the UK research agency. And when the funding was won to do the experiments, I happened to actually at the same time go to Imperial and Jose Torero to Queensland. And that meant that the team got dissolved. And it meant that the experiments actually happened, but unfortunately I was not part of them. It happened in the absence of any influence, positive or negative, that I could have. These experiments, which is a beautiful set of experiments, three sets, one in VRE with gas burners being operated at different times that was forcing the fire to travel, so to speak. VRE also but with wood grips where the fire traveled at the speed that it wanted to speed. And then an experiment, a beautiful experiment in Lisbon, in another compartment. These are the first time that the experiments, they were designed and they were analyzed with the objective of seeing a traveling fire. And they saw a traveling fire. And it was actually the first post traveling fire era experiments uh that were able to see this there was another experiment in the czech republic with david lang we were involved in this actually egly was there and addy were there two of my pg students working on the topic they were there in the czech republic the fire did travel in a completely different manner as expected but but it traveled. And we just gathered all these experiences and said, well, we want to also do more experiments. So I presented traveling fires in Warsaw, a conference where you were, Boje, and Pjort was also present. And at the end of, when I came down from the podium, you guys approached me and said, what do you need to do this experiment? I literally was saying, you're crazy. This cannot be done. This would be impossible. You need a very large facility. You need a large building. And it was Bjorn who says, well, I know a lot of Farby Gates. I'll get back to you. And during the course of six months, he was calling me every month saying, I found this building. He was sending me photos, and I was saying, no, no, that's not, thank you, but not. And one day he sent me a building, and I thought, oh, wow, that building would be great. It's open space, plenty of windows. And then he went and says, oh, it cannot be done, because it was built on top of a transformer station, transformer station with oils. I said, yeah, no, that will definitely not go well. And then months later, he came on and said, okay, I got it. But sorry, Guillermo, it used to be a cow house with the house. I was like, what? And then he showed me the photos. It was perfect. It was incredible. It was literally open plan, wide range with multiple amount of windows. It's important to have a lot of windows so you have plenty of ventilation that imitates as if the compartment will be even larger because one thing that is important in traveling fires is that the fire that is not influenced by the presence of a wall not ceiling and floor are fine but it's the wall if the fire is seeing always the influence of the wall because the wall is changing the flows it's arriving with fresh air if there's a window that if it's a wall doesn't happen. And that is actually recirculation and the wall itself could be absorbing a lot of heat or it could be actually insulating the fire. And that's what we wanted to do. We wanted a large compartment where the effect of the wall is minimized, as opposed to a small compartment where the effect of the wall is maximized. Literally in a small compartment in a furnace, but you do a lot of furnace testing, there is not one molecule of that place that cannot stop filling the wall very close by. The furnace is basically a structure of walls that radiate on your sample. That's the principle. And the flows are all controlled as well by the presence of the wall. So all these molecules that are inside there are chemically reacting and fully aware that somewhere nearby there is a wall. And what we want to move is we want to move into a place where the fire, yes, of course it knows there are walls. Of course the fire knows that it's enclosed, but not that intimately related to the walls. So that's what we wanted, not only just a large compartment, but plenty of openings such that it would actually, I say, imitate that if it were to be even larger okay because almost an infinite space yeah that would be obviously ideal an infinite space where there is no wall there is just ceiling and floor and let the fire do whatever it wants to do as you start to bring walls you are complicating the problem and obviously at some point you end up in a small compartment and the the idea was if this happens, flashover will not be possible or it will be unlikely with the typical few loads of an office building. And then we found this place. You guys talked to the Farby Gates and the Farby Gates of the local town where this was happening were happy to be involved. It was amazing. They were involved. We found sponsors to this crazy. It was amazing. They were involved. We found sponsors to this crazy idea. Arup and Serip in particular and EPSRC and the Society of Air Protection Engineers. We always need to thank sponsors that support crazy ideas. And then there was just an army of PhD students and visitors and we sent them all to Warsaw there for three weeks. And they designed, because actually it has to be designed, they designed a fuel load. We bought sticks of wood, 3,000 of them. We put them meticulously, we ignited. We had many different cameras and thermocouples and different devices measuring what was going to happen. And what we observed is that the fire traveled we also discovered many things that we were not ready to do for example we lost a lot of our cameras uh it was a lot of fun we didn't know it was going to be a lot of fun it was safe we were not sure about that but we also discovered that the fire accelerated obviously you said these things in hindsight and then people say of course it accelerated like of course it accelerated just show me the paper where it says that it was going to do that. So the fire accelerated in the sense that it started very small and very slowly and ended up being a relatively fast fire. That was the really end of it. To the point that then the question is, but what happens if it's even larger? Right? Because if it's accelerating. In hindsight, when we've discussed the ideas for your experiment, because if it's accelerating... In hindsight, when we've discussed the ideas for your experiment, I've run some CFD to see what would be the heat feedback in front of the fire with different sizes of the fire that you could get. And what I've observed with these CFDs was that this, with every 100 kilowatts or 250 kilowatts that I've added to my fuel, the radiation in front of the fire did not increase linearly, but exponentially. And then, well, it's to the fourth power of temperature, and temperature is correlated with heat release rate, so it's kind of obvious. But, I mean, it was obvious that as the fire will go larger, it will have a bigger impact on the fuel nearby, which means it will change the way how it ignites. That's an easy thing to think of. The hard one is how much and when. Then these two things, it was not possible. And then we come back to the issue of the physical modeling of the fire spread in large compartment, because this balance in heat transfer, in all of the modes of heat transfer, it's almost unsolvable for such a complex fuel, such a complex setting of a building, you know, and that makes it beautiful in a way. And also, I think, and that's my own opinion, the flashover is the manifestation of the same thing. It just happens within a second. But it's essentially the same feedback loop that's going on in your compartment. The more heat you release, the more radiation easier to ignite. Eventually, you go to self-ignition temperature, and there it is. The whole room is in fire. So this is the difficult one to capture, and you had this very clever idea on how to measure it with cameras. It's a big loss that they were melted in this experiment. Luckily, you were brave enough to pursue this again. And we've met once again in the same cowhouse two years later to repeat the experiment. And it also was a lot of fun. But let's go back to 2017 when the first experiment happened. So when you saw that, what were your feelings? Were you like, yes, we've proven it happens? Or were you like, why the hell did it accelerate? No, no, at first, I mean, it was a very realistic fire in the sense that it was a true building with true, incredible amount of smoke. Probably the worst airport can see us and everything. So in the moment, it was very confusing. We were very happy that it had finished, but we didn't know very well what had happened. Everybody remembers that at the beginning it was traveling, and everybody remembers the panic because the firefighters were starting to see all the external flaming. And also I was particularly very worried because we lost many, many cameras. We had protected the cameras. They were firmly protected. But we glued them into the wall of the compartment that was made of a layer of mortar and the mortar literally just exploded when the fire was coming and it was taking our cameras to the floor so i was very worried after the fire we didn't have data but eggly like a scout they did absolute wonderful things and was able to use handheld cameras that survived the fire and and with artificial intelligence and computer vision, she actually was able to track the two fronts, the two edges of the fire. She was able to track the movement of the leading edge. That's already an accomplishment of the paper. We saw and we observed, because we wanted to observe that, what was happening to the leading edge of the flame. And we also observed in detail, and I believe it was the magic behind this, the trailing edge of the fire. And we were able to plot the two of them in time. And in between them, what you have is the size of the fire. So we saw that at the beginning it was small, and the leading edge was going faster and accelerating faster than the trailing edge that was making a bigger fire. And then at some point, the remaining part of the compartment was all of it engulfed. But it was interesting because we did not observe a flashover. So if you go to the state of the art of what scientists call a flashover, not what someone that is in the moment of a experiment says, oh, that's a little big. Oh, it must be a flashover. Well, that felt big. Oh, it must be a flashover. Well, that's not a scientific definition. If you use a scientific definition of flashover, OBOTA is called, X1, this experiment, was not a flashover experiment. It was not sudden. The average temperature in the compartment was definitely not 500 Celsius. The ceiling, the heat flux to the floor of the ceiling was actually not above the level that typically we cite. And not all the windows were having external flaming. So it was not a flashover. Yes, towards the end, it was a big fire. And that, for us, was the accomplishment. It was to show scientifically to the community that two traveling fires exist, that traveling fires is a different thing than a flashover, and that there is a lot of things to learn. For example, the fact that the leading edge was moving faster than the trailing edge and that the difference in the two of them was actually growing. From my perspective, I was there with Francesco Restuccia, another PhD student of yours. We were given a perimeter of the roof to protect with a hose because the building was it was a concrete building but the structure of the attic was wooden so we had to Wet the joint between the wall and attic outside of the building to not have a collapse of the roof on the on top of the building and We were there with Francesco Wetting this thing and then you clearly see, you know, these flames moving away from us. And we, together with the relief, oh, thank God the fires travel. Because it's moving away from us and it will soon be safe. And it was just a few minutes later. So, yeah, that was our observation on the nature of traveling fires. And you've also mentioned that Egle has done a fantastic job of reconstructing the event from the external observations like we did with our cell phone cameras. There were some cameras placed outside the building to just create this bunch of images of what was happening around. They were not the primary scientific devices used in this experiment. The primary ones, all of them die. Yeah, but what you've said in the beginning of the interview, that it was first observed in World Trade Center where people literally seen it travel. It's the same what happened in 2017. It's just we've done it scientifically, or EGLE has turned our unscientific observations into a scientific study. So that's phenomenal. Well, I mean, obviously the World Tree Center was a magic tragedy, but also it didn't have a name. So, for example, if you read the investigation of the World Tree Center, the many of them, they don't mention this word. They don't say traveling fires. The modelers from NIST, Kevin McGrath and his team, did something very interesting. They actually simulated a traveling fire in FDS, in fire dynamic simulator. They just didn't realize that what they were doing was a breakthrough compared to what structural engineers were doing. So I was trying to tell Kevin Magrata, and he was very casual about it. It's like, I felt the need to burn the office areas just one by one and let the fire be in different places. I thought, but Kevin, that's a traveling fire. Well, I don't know what it's called, but it's just what we did. I thought, that's amazing. So we actually cited the work of Kevin McGrath and the investigation as evidence that fires travel. They didn't call it like that, but that's actually what they were doing. Now let's go into the model itself. I've seen the evolution of the model. I am inside of that. So first, the earliest version developed in the PhD of Jamie Stengosfried. It had this assumed temperature that the maximum peak temperature that the structure will be exposed to. If I'm not wrong, it was 1200 degrees Celsius. Then I remember PhD of Eglera Koskajta, where she has considered that it's not a uniform temperature and there are factors that influence this temperature. And there were some corrections input to that. Then Heidari did flame extensions and another iteration of changing that. And we know there are efforts ongoing in the world to use even more complicated methods to use it. Ideas to use zone models, to use some hybrid zone models with smaller cells, up to CFD scale, where you just use full CFD to determine this. And my question is, I see that in a way the power of this method comes from the fact that you can account for hundreds, if not thousands, of fire scenarios in a compartment. You've said you don't know what the fire will be. You don't know where the fire will start. So what is the furthest point from your fire if you don't know where it started? And there is this difficult balance of this triangle of accuracy, computational efficiency, and when you have a true solution, let's say the closest to the truth. So what is your take on that? How detailed must the model be to be useful? And is approximate model still useful, for example, in instructional engineering? Yeah, great question, Bhoji. It's the question that every single engineer asks themselves at any discipline, not only just in fire engineering, is how complex does my model have to be in order to be useful? As engineers, we recognize that the complexity has to be justified. So we don't just embrace complexity just because we think it's fun or fascinating or someone has told us. We embrace complexity because we have a professional or scientific argumentation of why it needs to be this complexity and no more and no less. So the particular approach to traveling fire actually is a good example of this. The methodologies that existed before traveling fires were very good, and they were providing a level of safety, structural safety, but we thought that with a minimum amount of more complexity, we could enable the structural engineers to embrace a set of scenarios that was not in their radar at all. And we designed traveling fires methodology, the first, the second, I mean, the six of them, the eight of them that we have developed, the eight of them are minimal increases in complexity compared to the previous use of any model by structural engineers, such that they could embrace it, and that without too many difficulties, they could bring it into the design daily lives. This is in comparison to complete disruptive ways of doing things. For example, people who were bringing CFD. In a way, NIST was bringing a CFD design scenario with a traveling fire. They were saying, embrace my CFD. Structural engineers are not going to be embracing CFD in the near future. It takes way too long to compute. Yes. And actually, you know, someone says, and it gives you accuracy. Actually, you know what? It doesn't even give you accuracy because it's actually not true that CFD predictions are the current state of our knowledge of fire. It gives you more accuracy. But for sure, it gives you more complexity and longer times and more difficulties. People who have said structural engineers need to use CFD, that's not going to work. Not in the next 50 years, at least, because they are busy enough with their finite elements. They are busy enough with the structure. So the role of the fire engineers or the fire scientists is to help them increase the level of sophistication of their analysis without making their lives impossible. That's what I wanted to do. This is what I can claim that traveling fires was doing. And that's why CFD approaches are not going to work in this problem in the near field, because the next engineering discipline that is doing this cannot catch up on the tool. But I want to make a comment on what you said. There are, as far as I know, there are 15 models. I don't call our work models, but actually it's true that there are models because they are conceptualizations of a phenomenon. We call them methodologies to make sure that people don't forget that the model is attached to the way it is going to be used. The model per se is not in the air, in the abstract. It's married literally to the way it can be used. And that's why some of the simplifications are called upon, because they have to be compatible to the way that it's going to be used in design. If I were to be doing traveling flyers, not for design, not for structural engineers, I would be doing a completely different approach, more similar to how I do forest fires, but I want it to be used in a methodology. So there are 15 methodologies existing. Six of them are ours. Two of them existed before we arrived. So when we revisited the literature with Jamie, not only we discovered experiments where people have seen traveling fires but were oblivious to it, we discovered that traveling fires had been independently being created twice before it. And the authors didn't know each other. One of them was in Belgium, the other one was in New Zealand. The two of the authors didn't know each other. Obviously, they didn't use the word traveling fires. The two of them were significantly different, but the two of them were allowing the fire to move in different ways with different assumptions. Obviously, we claim that our methodology at that time was more complete and more consistent with heat transfer and all these things. And that's up to the dates. And since then, they have been the model by Danny Hopkins. Now we know if are the model by University of Edinburgh. They have another model of their own. There is a model in the Czech Republic. There is another model coming from Belgium. They just keep popping up. And that is really good news. That means the concept is catching. Most of them at this point use the word traveling fire, which is really good because that in a way is a way to integrate the literature. Although I actually have to tell you that now there are papers that are coming out with a new name. That's a pity. Now they're creating new names. They're saying, no, it's not a traveling fire, it's a spreading fire. No, it's not a spreading fire, it's a moving fire. Anyway, that's the tribal behavior of scientists. And it's good that there are different ways of modeling this, because with time we will be combining and choosing the one model or the parts of the models that are combined together, allowing engineers, structural engineers, to do their job better. I like what you're saying about the complexity that has to be justified. I see a parallel to my world of smoke control, where you have smoke plume entrainment correlations that allow you to calculate the amount of smoke that travels upwards in a smoke plume above a fire. And you have CFD, which essentially you do the same thing. And there are buildings or compartments in which empirical models are more than fine to be used. And they give you good representation of what the outcome of a fire in such a room would be. And there are rooms in which you have to use CFD because the abstract space is not compatible with the complex flow that will be there. Sorry, the simple model is not compatible with the complexities of the space in which it will be placed because it was developed for the empty space. In a similar way, maybe the simplest traveling fire models are compatible with simple open plan spaces. But as soon as you start to turn your building into a labyrinth, they may lose the ability to predict these scenarios or give these scenarios. But I guess that is the future. And at some point, we will more or less get to a point where we have a tool for every fire scenario. Maybe artificial intelligence or something fancy will emerge at some point that will help us figure out which traveling fires are the one to seek. Or maybe a world in which you use the simple model to screen for potential scenarios and then you solve the most onerous one. That's also, I can see that that could happen. But the great thing is, I think the biggest disruption this method has created is to decouple the structural fire engineering from this fire resistance paradigm and this blind vision of the fire will be there, it will take the whole room, let's solve for that, we're done. To just decouple structural fire engineers from this concept is as powerful for me as understanding the complex behavior in a building. And the method has already achieved that, no matter what the fidelity of it is. What you mentioned, Boje, is actually quite important to disassociate structural engineering from only flashover. There is another scenario that actually was there before traveling fire, which is localized fire, which is recognizing that sometimes there is no fuel everywhere. It is just a concentrated amount of fuel and that if it burns, it could be a local threat to a structure that crosses that path or is nearby or a column. The fascinating part that I can say now is that they did that, but they did not realize the difference between the space, between the localized fire and the flashover. They didn't realize that in reality a localized fire that is allowed to move, it is the link between the two of them. But now we can say we have this continuum. There is a localized fire that doesn't move, there is a traveling fire, and then there is still the flashover fire. That's beautiful. And tell me where you're going with it. Well, now, okay, so Heradi has just graduated with his PhD, Mohamed Heradi from Zerib. And what he did is he fixed our near field. Our near field as heat transfer experts was not up to standards of heat transfer. We got a lot of flack from that. What Heradi did is he improved it in a way that doesn't make it more complex. So he actually hit the sweet spot between being simple and being more accurate and more comprehensive. So we are actually very happy with the work of Heradi. The next step, we're thinking of two of them. One is to make it probabilistic, and Heradi has already done that. The fact that it's not just deterministic, but over a range of families. Now it's actually that you could have different fuels. A range of ranges. You could have a range of ranges. You could have a range of flammability parameters, and you could have a range of fuel loads. And then you run this through a Monte Carlo approach approach and you end up having probabilistic behaviors, which was fascinating. But we just scratched the surface with Herade on this. But it is probabilistic traveling fires. And there is another one based on the work that we're working with ADOP. So it's a paper published in Farm Materials, literally just this morning, where it's fascinating, where a water from Warsaw was replicated brick by brick. Okay, so this old 50 years old cowhouse forgotten in Warsaw has now a twin and it's not a digital twin, it's an actual brick twin in France in Serib and it's still standing by the way and it's literally the same, same doors, same walls, same dimensions, same everything. It's just like brand new and so far in very neat conditions. And instead of burning a concrete structure, which is the original of Obora, they were burning a timber structure. They were putting timber columns, they were putting a timber ceiling, CLT and GULAM in particular. And they put the fuel loads that we did in Obora and they started to observe what happens. And the first thing that happens is that the fact that you have added more fuel and you put that in the ceiling, which is the most part where it's exposed to the highest heat fluxes, yes, indeed it changes the behavior of the fire. And actually what we saw is that what we saw that day was actually closer to what we will call flashover. It is a fire in a very large compartment that even I would say it almost meets the scientific definition of a flashover. It doesn't really do, but it almost defines a flashover. It was a big, big fire. And that requires the fact that the ceiling is flammable and that you have a leading edge in the ground fuel and a trailing edge in the ground fuel. And you have again the same on the ceiling because the ceiling will have a leading edge and a trailing edge. It means that we are thinking of bringing a new model of traveling fires that brings into account what happens also to the ceiling. These little details that completely change the complexity of the problem and really make you appreciate the world of fire science. We had this moment in a recent experiment where we were very happy with our, let's say, predictions of what will happen in a small compartment. Then we've put a beam into the compartment and it changed everything. And it was like, what a great time to be a fire scientist whatever you like these tiny changes change things completely so for the last question and it's also in a way an appreciation in all of these experiments or the recent one at least i see aropa being heavily involved which is an engineering company and they don't sell compart company, and they don't sell compartments, obviously, and they don't sell anything, yet they seem to be funding this research and promoting the methodology and are very active in development of that. And I think, in a way, your collaboration with them on this project is, in a way, a model. A lot of interesting questions could have been answered in fire engineering world so how did you convince a commercial company that does not have a direct economical interest in pursuing such a program to so heavily invest in that and convince them that it's for the better so the professional relationship that my group has with adobe is the most beautiful thing that i've been involved with i've been working with adobe since i arrived to the uk literally i met them within months within weeks of arriving to scotland when i was in edinburgh and since then i've created a partnership that just keeps growing and growing and growing in three things that i want to highlight the first one is there were very early believers. At this point, it was believing in the concept of traveling fires, whereas most people in the community were saying, you're crazy what you're talking about. And very often you are wrong, Guillermo. Adub said, that is very interesting. How can we help you so you develop this further? Let's see what are your findings. And they funded the PhD of Jamie Stead Gottfried, which was actually an engineer in Adub. That led to Adub to be the first engineering company in the world that used traveling fire in a real building. That's a major thing, right? It goes from the paper or the PhD thesis to a real building. I mean, as a scientist, I'm still impressed that that happened. And then Adub developed this in more of their buildings, and then the competitors started to pay attention to this. And when they were asking to ADOPE, what is this traveling fire thing? ADOPE was actually giving them a copy of a thesis of James St. Crosby. They said, well, you will read everything about it here in this thesis. So ADOPE was not only just key in sponsoring the research, it was an early adopter, and it was a key agent in the spread of traveling farm methodology all across England. It was first, then it was in Scotland, it was also in the Middle East, and it was also in Canada, and even the United States now is thinking of doing it. Without ADOP, nothing like this would have happened for many multiple reasons. Also, ADOP has been a major company hiring my pg students literally every single pg student upset heradi mohammed were hired by adobe immediately right after and many other ones so that creates an interface between the research and the engineering the fact that adobe is able to put the scientists to work as engineers right away and the third one is that, it's not that they were involved, it's that they led, they designed, and they justified and they found the money to this experiment that I told you that happened in France, this replica of Obora with CLT and Gulen in timber. It is not that I convinced them. In this case, it was actually they did it. They knew how to do it, and they just invited me to help them and to be involved in the decisions and the details of how to do it. So for these three reasons, the relationship that we have with Adopt is incredible, very, very important for my career. You said Adopt. I might not be here today being interviewed in your podcast. The fact that an engineering company was there from the start, was trying to use the abstract idea in real engineering, in a way, beta testing the usefulness of this model. If the model was too slow or not reliable, they would tell you and you would know and you could apply changes. I think without this collaboration, it would have just ended as a beautiful idea or a beautiful model that would be put on a shelf like it happened with many models. And in my own engineering, I also solve issues that are key for my own engineering and the engineering of my colleagues at the office. And these things happen to be important for many engineers over the world. So I really cherish this model collaboration between your scientific unit and an engineering company. And I'm very happy to see many other engineering companies. It's not that they start. There are many companies that invest in science. And I think this is a key in building a safer future for us all. So with this kind accent, thank you so much for being here again. I hope it's not the last time for you at the Fire Science Show that there is at least 37 other topics that we need to cover in the podcast. I hope we'll get to that. Thank you, Boje. It's always a pleasure to talk to you and you just give me a call whenever you want to hear Spanish accents from London. My artificial intelligence translator is not a huge fan, but we can handle that. It's much worse with Italians, really. Don't worry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for being here and see you around, Guillermo. Again, take care. Bye-bye, Wojciech. Thank you so much, Guillermo, both for this episode and discussion and for your enthusiasm and support to the podcast. That's much appreciated. I hope you've enjoyed this talk about traveling fires. You probably have heard a lot about them in the past but i think in this podcast episode gear shared some stuff that i i've personally never heard so i'm very happy i've learned something new today and traveling fires are very close to my heart i've been there at the experiments i've done some experiments myself actually tomorrow i'm presenting my first results from my own furnace traveling fire experiments, and I'm really excited about that. So I truly believe in this methodology. And I think in this episode, I really enjoyed that. It was quite focused on engineering and practicality. I mean, it's obviously important to understand the physics of fires and absolutely fundamental to know how they grow, how they move, how they decay, because without that knowledge, we're unable to predict them and fight them. However, I really enjoyed what Guillermo did in his time in Edinburgh and now at Imperial, he's continuing that, is that he recognizes the limitations of engineering and he's trying to produce science that's really useful to us engineers and trying to find ways how to model these fires in a way that is compatible with the ways we are modeling our fires today. So I think that's a great achievement to seek fire theory that is so complex yet so useful. We know that there are many approaches to traveling fires. There's much, much research being carried over the world. I'm actually going to try and link the research I know about traveling fires that I've seen in the literature by Edinburgh, by Queensland, the phenomenal papers by Hidalgo and all others from this large folk building experiment that Guillermo mentioned, and recent developments from Marcelo Mittal and other collaborators in their Travelling Fire project. And I hope some of this will be useful to you. We know that MetaDisc is already useful today, but it can be better. And as Guillermo mentioned, it's growing, it's developing and all the knowledge that we gain from all over the world can be added to this to create and emerge new better ways of designing and creating a bit safer world. And that would be it for today's episode. Thank you so much for being here, for listening to it. I hope you've enjoyed it. As usually, next week, another really good episode. I'm super excited about the next week's episode. I've talked about AI for the third time in the podcast and for the third time it was a fantastic experience and once again I'm convinced that this is kind of the future of fire science and engineering. So if you would like to see the future, join me next Wednesday and yeah, take care. See you soon. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
