 Hello everyone, welcome to episode 5 of the FireSense show. Today, another episode, another important issue that troubles many fire safety engineers, and myself included. We're going to talk battery fires and electric vehicle fires. The knowledge on this type of fires is in never-ending demand for fire safety engineering, so I hope you'll truly enjoy this one. It's going to be a bit different. It's going to be a two-piece episode. In part one, I'm welcoming with me Roland Bishop, who is a project manager at RISE in Sweden, who will share his first-hand experience in burning some of electric vehicles and what Dave learned while doing that. Dave learned while doing that. And I'm very happy to learn from him because it's some really important data points for my own research. And in the next episode, in the next week, I'm going to take the mic and tell you a little bit of our research on what are the consequences of electric vehicle fires in modern car parks and if there are any solutions that we can already implement, despite the fact that the knowledge is limited, the data is limited, and yeah, we kind of have to work with what we have. That's the only solution. So yeah, I hope you will enjoy this interview and the next episode that we'll follow in the next week. So without further ado, let's spin the intro and jump into the topic of electric vehicle fires and car battery fires. Hey, Roland, thanks for joining me. Hello. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Can you introduce yourself a bit? How did you land up doing the battery fires? It's a long story, but yeah, my name is Roland. I'm originally from the Netherlands and eventually moved to Sweden for some studies as a mechanical engineer. Eventually moved to Sweden for some studies as a mechanical engineer. Met my girlfriend here and ended up staying here. But yeah, I'm not like a fire engineer or electrochemical or electrical engineer. I'm just a mechanical engineer who kind of ended up in the whole battery research area because that was kind of growing so fast at RISE when I started working there. The need for doing tests and gaining knowledge in that area was growing so fast at RISE when I started working there. The need for doing tests and gaining knowledge in that area was growing so fast, so I had to grow along with it, so to say. That's not an uncommon story, like both stories. I brought you here because I've read your paper written with Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I think it was first authored by Pei Ji Sun. It's a review on battery fires in electric vehicles. And I must say this paper was so useful to me because I'm trying to research the how these fires of electric vehicles, battery fires in electric vehicles, how do they differ from the fires that we meet every day in designing the car parks, the ones that we've been studying and learning for decades. So the first thing is when I see the videos of electric vehicle fires, if you like go YouTube, go electric vehicle fire, you'll find a lot of them. And every now and then there's a new one. And they seem very similar to each other in the way that there's usually this huge cloud of smoke coming from from nowhere, this this huge cloud of smoke coming from nowhere, this huge jet of flames coming from out of nowhere, and very rapid development into this jet fire type of fire. So is this something that, touching the subject scientifically, you also observe? Yeah, I would say there are many different ways in which batteries or battery packs can fail and what the outcome may be. But if you just look at the lithium-ion battery cells themselves, when we do tests, we see first, when we start abusing them, we overcharge them or we heat them up or whatever. They will release a cloud of smoke. They'll pop. They build up pressure. They pop. They release like a cloud of smoke they'll pop like they build up pressure they pop they release a small cloud of smoke and that already is is like flammable cloud of smoke it's not a very large amount nothing major is happening yet then but if if we then keep pushing the battery keep abusing it then then we get into this thermal runaway stage and the battery releases lots of gas very rapidly, which may or may not ignite. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. So it's like a cascading fire of the smaller cells within the whole battery pack? Yeah, so this process will happen to each cell in the in the battery pack and and how it will cascade through the battery pack it's uh it can vary a lot like you have different cell sizes and chemistries and materials in between the cells if you have cooling or not how the failure was initiated uh that can affect how the fire will or the thermal runaway will propagate through a battery pack. There are many, yeah, many variables. Obviously, it's a whole emerging field of science. It's not something you can answer with a single answer. No, it's kind of annoying. Usually when we get questions like this from a customer, they say, okay, if my battery goes into thermal runway, what will happen? And I have to say, well, it depends. Depends. Yeah. Well, I think in the media, in the internet, you are probably biased towards the outcomes that are most visually impressive. I mean, there was this famous viral video of fire in Shanghai, I think, where there was an electric vehicle, and it very rapidly developed into a large fire. Actually, that video was the reason why I've picked up this subject in my studies. Because I was not scared that electric vehicles will burn and fail. The media gives this impression that now we're unsafe because there's electric vehicles around. But my point was that if it happens once, it means it may happen. And I would really love to know what are the consequences of these fires to the car parks and their users, if such an event could happen. From your perspective, because you studied that, such an outcome like this fire on the video, is that something typical for this fire? Or it was just one extreme type of behavior that can happen? Yeah. So here comes the fun answer. It depends. But the thing is, what you see in that video, I agree, that's quite the extreme kind of scenario where one battery cell fails and it propagates almost throughout the entire battery pack in the span of a minute. That can happen. I have seen it happen in the tests that we've done. But I would say more my experience with doing tests is that it can take quite a long time from like the very first failure, the very first cell that fails. It can take a very long time until anything happens after that. So sometimes we do a test, we start the thermal runaway in one cell, we wait 10 minutes, nothing happens. Wait 15 minutes, nothing happens. 20 minutes, still nothing happens. And then maybe eventually we get some more action, then everything kind of happens all at once. Sometimes it's like that, sometimes it's not like that. You said nothing happens, but do you see indications of some failure going into the battery and i'm not not i don't mean the battery management system system which probably does see some uh like from an outsider perspective imagine you're standing next to such a vehicle would you be able to tell that it's ongoing a failure you may you may be able to see the very initial failure you may see that there's like a puff of smoke that is being released but after that i don't think you can see it i'm asking these questions because uh in our studies um we focused on the very initial phase of the fire and we were curious about what would happen in the car park if the fire developed very quickly like in that video in a way it shows it shows the development of a fire almost instantaneously. And we designed our car parks based on some certain design fires currently. And we wondered, OK, if I designed my car parks for the last 20 years in this way, if now there's an electric vehicle or some sort of battery-powered device inside that goes through such a rapid fire development, will my occupants be able to escape? And will my systems be able to detect and respond to that threat in a time scale that would matter, you know? Because if there's such a growth of fire and it takes five minutes for my systems to respond, then it means my systems were not really that useful in the fire so i'm really interested in this in this uh very early um phase of the fire where it can actually quickly cascade into into something large though i found it reassuring that you said it was on a it was rather an extreme uh not a not a typical fire that you would see every time you no no we don't see it every time but it can happen absolutely but that when it comes to designing your systems to to to be able to handle such an extreme case i don't know if that's even possible to be be honest with you. We found that it's like almost impossible. Like they didn't make almost no difference. And the only variable was the height, which I'll discuss in here more thoroughly, because it is kind of interesting to see that with such a threat, we're kind of helpless as fire engineers. The other thing that I found reassuring in your paper was that heat release rate if you can say or peak heat release rate of of the vehicle fire when you consider electric vehicles versus internal combustion engine vehicles you didn't find any like significant differences between these vehicles like they they were i mean it was still in the level of few megawatts, not that one would be 100 and another would be. Yeah, exactly. Could you comment on how did you get to these findings and what did you observe? Yeah, so there have been some, as you said, full-scale fire tests on electric vehicles and compared them to internal combustion engine vehicles. And at RISE, we did these tests also. We did tests combustion engine vehicles. And at RISE, we did these tests also. We did tests on three vehicles. So one internal combustion engine vehicle, and then the exact same vehicle, but then the electric version of that. And then we had an EV family car. It is like you say, we don't see any significant difference in the peak heat release rate or even the total heat release, difference in the peak heat release rate or even the total heat release for that matter. Actually, we found that it's not so much the powertrain. So if it's electrical or if it's gasoline, diesel, whatever, that makes the big difference. It's more how does the fire start, which really has an impact on how rapid does the fire grow and how high will the peak heat release rate get. that is actually the main significant thing rather than the vehicle itself that being said there are some some things still to to to study when it comes to these really worst case kind of thermal propagation scenarios that start within the battery pack i don't think anyone anyone has tested that yet on a full scale, of course. I think we all realize in the fire safety side of the problem that it's something we need to find a solution because, I mean, that's the direction of where we are heading. We cannot escape this issue that it's too hard or too complex or non-interesting. We cannot deal with that now we need to we need to find solutions and uh experiments like you mentioned these are pioneering studies that reveal the behavior of these uh devices and i find it fascinating because if you study how the the batteries are built um at least the ones with cells. They are built from small elements, put into packages, which are merged into larger packages. So it's really interesting how the scales will play around. Absolutely. Is this also something that you study in RISE when touching this subject? Yeah, I mean, the scales, they have a huge, huge impact. Like what batteries, the battery cells themselves that you use in your battery pack, they have a very large impact on how the fire will develop. So for example, in the vehicles that we tested, we had a battery pack that had pouch cells, so kind of like these aluminum bags that contain the cell that you usually also have in smartphones. And in those cases, we saw for that specific battery pack that when we had a fire and the battery pack did become involved in the fire, almost the entire, like all the cells in the battery pack were contributing to the fire at the same point. So in that case, we had actually very, very high peak heat release rate compared to the other electric vehicle that we tested, which had other cells, which are prismatic cells. So they're like metal cans and those take a bit longer to heat up and they can tolerate pressure a bit more. And in that case, we saw much like longer uh yeah it burned longer in the battery pack you can say and we could much more clearly see like oh here one cell is ventilating gas here goes the next cell here's the next cell but with the pouch cells everything went at once so so that's uh that and that's just the um the form factor of the. Then you also have to think about the chemistry and how much energy is stored in each individual cell, which can also impact results. This is great. You segwayed me to the next thing I wanted to ask you. Because you have also compared the heat release rate in the function of the range of the vehicle. function of the range of the vehicle. So I was astounded that the behavior of this gasoline versus battery vehicles is very similar in terms of the energy released per the fuel mass in the vehicle. I guess for the internal combustion vehicles, it's directly like linearly correlated with the amount of flammable liquids you have in the in the vehicle yeah what what makes the batteries more dangerous when they're charged actually i would almost put it the other way around i would say the full fuel tank is uh more dangerous than a fully charged battery pack because uh what we've seen in our tests, like vehicles, they usually use plastic fuel tanks. And as soon as they rupture, you have like a huge pool file, which can easily spread to multiple vehicles at once. Whereas when we did these tests with the battery packs, the ones we tested, they're like solid aluminum enclosures that actually contain whatever is going on inside of the battery pack quite well. But when it comes to the size of the battery pack and how that correlates to the amount of energy that is released during the fire, we actually saw that the total heat release from a battery pack scales quite linearly with the amount of electrical energy that is stored in the battery pack. The maximum that it can take, not at the current moment, right? Usually we express the energy of the battery pack in terms of the nominal. So that's kind of like the midpoint okay so usually when we calculate that we we yeah we look at what is the nominal uh voltage and the capacity of the battery pack and uh we relate that so it almost linearly correlated with the nominal yeah yeah exactly but this is not the case for uh heat release. Heat release rate, it's quite hard to relate that to the size of the battery because it's very dependent on the specific battery and the specific battery cells and the charge level. It's much more sensitive to that. If you take the research on vehicle fires from the past, when you really take a good look into these experiments, you usually find that an open window may have had a bigger impact on the fire than the type of a vehicle or whatever other physical condition the vehicle was in. That's what I meant with conditions for the vehicle to burn itself. Because when you exclude the powertrain, it's the same vehicle. It has a couch, it has upholstered interior, it will have a lot of cables, it will have a lot of plastics that are not related to the fact that it is in particular an electric vehicle. You also mentioned that you actually had two copies of a vehicle, one of which was electric, one of which was a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, and you burned them both. Did the observations match? No. I remember that when we did the test, when we did the internal combustion engine vehicle, we had simulated a pool fire underneath the vehicle. And within, I think it was five minutes, the plastic fuel tank ruptured. And then we had a very, very fast fire growth. Whereas when we did the test with the electric vehicle, we had a burner directly underneath the battery pack. And there, I believe it took about 15, 20 minutes before the battery pack actually started to contribute to the fire. You know, the things are fascinating because we as fire scientists, we sometimes don't appreciate enough the consequences of our choices during the research, which are usually honest choices because we need to make choices. Like you said, where to place your ignition source or how to simulate some events. And we as scientists do this to capture the truth in the best way we can. And my second hat is an engineer, and I do a lot of CFD simulations for car park. I help smoke control engineers design smoke control systems for car park. And in this world, they don't really care that much if your window was open or closed. For them, it's a car fire. And they just want the value of heat release rate they can place in the simulation and solve the issue of designing this specific car park. and solve the issue of designing this specific car park. And in a way, it's a system that works, because if we have a design fire for a vehicle, if we base our solutions in the building on that particular design fire, I mean, it's a method that can be replicated among many offices. It allows us to compare the systems. So, yeah, but then as a scientist, So, yeah, but then as a scientist, if you think if you could define a single design fire curve for car parks, like are we in a place where we could do it now for electric vehicles? No, I think we need to do more tests. The developments with electric vehicles and battery packs, they're going so fast. And we haven't done so many tests yet, honestly. So, yeah, we have some nice data now that we have from our tests and also from tests done in France and Canada, which is very helpful. But maybe they're not even representative of next year's electric vehicles anymore. So we have some catching up to do, you can say. Wow. Now that you mentioned that, it's true that technology is rapidly advancing, and you can see that from a consumer perspective, looking at the range of the vehicles, how it grows. Like every year, the vehicles can travel further and they're lighter, which means there must have been some improvements in the battery technology because it's unlikely they have much lighter upholstery. No, exactly. Like when I started working at RISE, we were maybe testing like battery cells the individual cells maybe they were just the cylindrical ones were two and a half ampere hours and the prismatic ones larger ones were 50 ampere hours but now i'm looking at cells that are close to 200 ampere hours much much larger and much more stuff happening when they do actually catch fire so just based on that i I can see that we have some way to go still. And from your perspective as a researcher, is the fire behavior of these batteries a factor in designing these cells? Or it's just a byproduct of the design that has to be solved and not really being the driver of the design? No, fire safety is not of the battery cells. I wouldn't say that's the driver of the of the design no fire safety it's it's not the of the battery cells it's i wouldn't say that's the driver of the design of course it's important uh it's more about yeah having as much energy at as little weight as possible um that being said from my from my perspective it's not so much that the individual battery cells shouldn't be allowed to fail. I think my perspective is more that if you design a battery pack or electric vehicle or energy storage system, whatever, you need to design it in such a way that you can tolerate that a battery cell will fail, but still keep everything under control so it doesn't spread throughout the remainder of the pack. So you should design that. You should allow for this type of failure to happen, basically. Wow, this is really powerful because I think you have, in that sentence, you have captured the spirit of fire safety engineering. We are not here to prevent Elon Musk from building electric vehicles. prevent Elon Musk from building electric vehicles. We are here to help them build them in a way that the risks are tolerable and we can manage them. That's the point. Because if we enter the design and we know how to manage the risk, we can do that. And the product is safety. Exactly. We are selling the safety to the people. So that's really great. And then you don't have to worry about this video that you were thinking about earlier also. Yeah. But these videos are powerful because it drops you a narrative on the whole subject. And sometimes these things are positive because it lets you grab the attention that an issue is emerging and you can solve for that issue. But on the other hand, they might do a lot of damage to the whole field because suddenly every incident is associated with this type of a fire. There's also this third aspect, the issue of probability of failure of battery and cascading the fire. That's a whole different topic. And to understand how often this type of events can occur. If we are the viral videos, there was also a recent video of like series of small buses, like having the fire jump from vehicle to vehicle. But also, like me viewing this video from a fire science engineer perspective, I mean, that was a fire of the whole of the vehicle, not just the battery. It was like the interior was burning. It was a huge fire. And the interesting part was it was propagating quite quickly. Is this vehicle-to-vehicle propagation something that you were already studying or it's something for the future? So in the tests that we did, we sort of looked at it, but not in great detail. We had some plate thermometers on either side of the vehicle to kind of estimate how much heat the surrounding vehicles could be exposed to. But vehicle-to-vehicle propagation, we have not touched on that yet. But hopefully we can do that in the future. But yeah, as you can imagine, burning vehicles is not so cheap to do. Getting one vehicle is a challenge. Getting six vehicles next to each other, that's another thing. You've mentioned you measure the plate thermometers around the vehicle. I think that's a great starting point because I know there was a very good PhD by Moch Tohir. good PhD by Moch Tohir. One of the best PhDs I've read and he was calculating this effective thermal dose, if you can call it like that, that is needed to ignite a certain part of a vehicle and associate probabilities of fire spreading from vehicle to vehicle based on these values. And I think even they've implemented it in B-Risk with Mike Spearpoint at some point. I mean, in the past there was research on spreading the fire from vehicle to vehicle and now you have the new boundary condition because your initial fire is completely different than the fire of the interior of the vehicle. So that's something to look for probably. And this thing with electric vehicles, in some cases, when you have the battery pack fire, you also have quite long jet flames that are ejected from the battery pack, which also brings into something new into play. When you say electric vehicle fire, that this jet fire is the first thing that comes to my mind because of the media attention that this element gets. Now, after this talk, I may look at this, seeking different cues and different development of the fire. But I will be honest with you, coming to this talk, the jet fire behavior was the one that I had in my mind associated with electric vehicle fire. So that's definitely something to look on and that definitely changes the physics of the whole fire in the car park. I mean, even from this perspective of smoke entrainment, if we design traditional vehicle car parks, we can see the fire source of the vehicle as a thermal buoyant plume of smoke, and we calculate the entrainment into this plume that is driven by buoyancy. And in a jet flame you have this quite significant amount of kinetic energy inside the jet because it's it's like propagating outside which is completely different momentum uh that just a flume of of of smoke it's actually sometimes problematic for when we do fire tests, because we have the large calorimeter hood, sucks up all the gas, and then we know the heat release rate. But in some cases, when we do fire tests on battery packs, the jet flames, they'll extend for several meters, and then we miss all of this with our measurements. That's something I've discussed with Matt Ponner when he was on the show that we had this issue like we've missed the interesting part of the fire by 20 centimeters. If the thermocouple was like 20 centimeters to the left it would be perfect but it was not. Then we figured out it's probably more valuable to stick 20 cameras into the experiment than stick 100 thermocouples, because at the end you may have more information from just observing the fire than from the instrumentation. Yeah, observation is underrated, I think. Yeah, that's that's one of the themes of the podcast um you touch a very important subject in here because uh yeah in if you want to exhaust the smoke from the car park it's very similar to exhausting uh smoke in an experiment from the hood so um do you like i i i've said this this thing about uh the the physics of the plumes uh based on my my knowledge of the of the of the smoke plumes but do you really observe this this different behavior of of uh the smoke clouds produced from battery fires like yeah that's uh that that is a challenging question to to give a good answer to. But let's say the cloud itself that is released at a very early stage, it's flammable gas. And even during the thermal runaway stage, if the gas is not ignited from the battery, it's also flammable gas. So in our case, we're usually not so concerned about the smoke that is being produced while the battery is burning. We're more concerned about the smoke that's produced when it's not burning. That is something we're worried about in our testing halls. But when it comes to how the smoke moves around uh yeah i i we have seen that the smoke is quite um yeah how do i say heavy yeah so some people call it heavy yeah that it doesn't want to it doesn't want to move upwards which means it does not have uh buoyancy we also noticed that that in the smoke itself we have lots of metal particles, like really fine metallic particles. And even some of the electrolyte contents that are inside of the battery cell, they have quite a high boiling point. So if I get all the smoke on me, I can have some sticky residue on my clothes. You probably don't want to do that. No, I would strongly not recommend. No, no, it's not good for the health, I can say. I can see. I also know that you have researched the contents of this smoke or the products of these fires. Could you give a general overview of what's produced in these fires? Because I guess it's not carbon dioxide and water like we would like from no so the products depending on whether you have ignition of the battery grass or after the ignition of the battery gas so before you have ignition of the battery gas the gas that is being produced it's a lot of hydrogen and co2 and what we see after ignition of the gas is lots of CO and even HF that is being produced then. So people usually are worried about the HF because it's not only when you inhale it that it's bad, but it can penetrate the skin and so on. So when there's burning, we get much HF. When there's no burning, we don't detect it usually. But when it comes to electric vehicles versus internal combustion vehicles, when either of them burns, they produce very large amounts of the toxic gases that are really, really bad for you. So it's like, yeah, electric vehicles compared to an internal combustion vehicle, they produce more hydrogen fluoride. But that is the main, the only difference. Regardless, they are both very, very bad for you. Yeah, because obviously in a normal fire, if we can call it a normal fire, in an internal combustion engine vehicle fire, In an internal combustion engine vehicle fire, there will be a lot of carbon monoxide produced, and there will be some very, like, hydrogen cyanide or something produced. If you have polyurethane, for example, used in upholstered furniture of the car, so in the interior. So, yeah, I've also, I've read that this HF is the one thing that differentiates between these two behaviors. Now I'm wondering, it would be interesting to quantify. Maybe such studies exist already and I'm not aware of them, but it could be interesting to quantify the amount of this HF in the mix, related to the suit content or the general visibility or obscuration characteristic of the cloud of gas. Because in like everyday fire engineering, there is this assumption, not sure where the origins of that are, but my good guess would be Great Britain. That if you have met your visibility conditions in a car park, the concentrations of the toxic products are probably not meeting their tenability criteria yet. And this means that it simplifies your analysis because if your goal is to maintain a certain level of visibility in your car park, like let's say 10 meters, it means that if you succeeded in 10 meters, it must obviously mean that you have succeeded in your toxicity as well because it's almost impossible for the toxic pollutants to be in a concentration that would be immediately dangerous when there's not enough suits to drop the visibility below 10 meters so that's a concept that simplifies uh this and this lot i'm wondering if if uh adding the hf to that mix if it can like make the tipping point somewhere that may be necessary to really um solve for that and measure that because you could possibly have the visibility uh met but still the concentrations of these products uh exceeded yeah actually we did actually uh do some simulations based on the test we did. We simulated electric car fire in a car park. I don't have the results of them on top of my head, but yeah. I could share the link to the report if you'd be interested. Oh, that's great. If you can, after the talk, send it to me and I'll put it in the show notes. So I will definitely read it up and I hope some of the listeners will as well. That's really intriguing because these emissions are, if we want to understand the problem completely, we need to understand how do these fires ignite, how they propagate, what's the consequence and in the end what's the product. That's a big question to be answered in here. And then you want to have done it for many different vehicles and many different types of fire initiations. Oh yeah, welcome to the world of fires, to the world of complexity. On my list of questions, I also had this question about extinguishing these fires. Because another thing that you learn from the media is that firefighters have big troubles putting them out. It's impossible. It's impossible, yeah. You've seen these videos where the fires, they've put it down and it's reignited, put down, reignited. That's kind of, you know, isited. That's kind of... Yeah. Is it something that you also observe while studying them? That it's like, okay, what do you do with the burned electric vehicle after your experiment? How do you manage that? Well, our motto is actually, if it burns, let it burn. Like to the end, okay. Yeah. Like if we have a battery pack that catches fire during a test or whatever, we don't interfere. We just let it burn until it's burnt out. If for some reason you don't have that option, you'll want to suppress it in some way. And then, yeah, there are different ways of suppressing the fire. And then, yeah, there are different ways of suppressing the fire. But from my point of view, the most important thing is that you are able to cool the battery cells that are inside of the battery pack as much as possible. Because you want to stop this cascading effect that one battery cell fails, then the next one, the next one, next one, next one. So when one battery cell has failed, you need to remove heat from the surrounding area if you can best way of doing that is to somehow inject the battery pack with water or or another type of cooling media uh you mean inside the pack yeah not inside the battery sprinkle it on top of the pack but no no guys you can sprinkle it on top of the pack, yeah? Inside the battery pack. Not just sprinkle it on top of the pack. No, you can sprinkle it on top of the pack, and that's better than doing nothing, of course. But imagine you have this thick steel aluminum enclosure. Inside of this aluminum enclosure, you have battery modules, which is another enclosure. And inside of the battery modules, you then have the battery cells. enclosure and inside of the battery modules you then have the battery cells so just spraying water on the outside of the battery pack it it it requires lots of lots of water to eventually cool uh sufficiently enough so that it reached the battery cells inside of the pack um so it's not a very efficient way to do it like that ideally Ideally you have, I mean, from my point of view, ideally there should be some type of connection on the battery pack to which the fire brigade can connect their fire hose, for example, when needed. They connect it, they just flush the battery pack as long as they need to. So like a safety valve that you could connect to and just, yeah, that would obviously the challenge is it would have to be standardized because then you would end up with American plug, European plug, and that would probably be not great. When you were talking about that, I had this crazy image in my head that water is very efficient at cutting things, and there are these high-pressure nozzles that you put against the wall, and it literally drills a hole through the wall to penetrate the interior. But then again, I realize it may not be the smartest thing to damage the cells inside as well. Exactly. You may cause more damage than they want. I've also saw some recommendations that you can flood the car or drop it in a tank of water. You may cause more damage than they want. I've also saw some recommendations that you can flood the car or drop it in the tank of water. Is that a strategy or is it just PR? Yeah, no, I wouldn't say that's PR. I think that's a viable strategy. There are some things, of course, you need to consider that you may have a burning vehicle and how are you going to handle a burning vehicle with a crane and lift it into a place. Like doing that procedure, you have to be careful, of course. But it will be more efficient than spraying water on the outside of a car battery pack and some of the benefits of taking the car and putting it in a container fulfilling the container with water any any like byproducts from the fire water runoff or etc it's all contained in that container so you can take the yeah the fire water and you can destroy it yeah that's a that's a very very very slight point you mentioned, because in fact, the fire science has a history of developing very, very efficient extinguishing methods. Like we used to use halons and then we figured out they destroy the atmosphere. There were certain types of foams that were used that we figure out they're very harmful for the environment. They were very efficient for the fire, but unfortunately, they were very efficient at damaging the life in the water as well yeah talking about hullens is is there any experience with using other medium than water on on extinguishing these uh these types of fires there is some some experience. Not for me personally. Most of the tests that we've done have been with water or either with water and some type of foam additive. Okay. I do know that many tests have also been done with using, for example, inert gas or NOVEC, for example. gas or uh novec for example um and they they may be successful in like knocking out the flame and preventing combustion of the battery gas but they do not usually stop thermal runaway they don't stop the thermal runaway process and they usually don't actually provide cooling to the to the battery cell or the cells that are around it. So it's like two issues to solve. One, to remove the flaming, which they can succeed at, but they cannot prevent creation of the new fuel. Yeah. In one way, yes, you want to remove the flaming. In another way, no, you don't want to remove the flaming either. Yeah. In another way, no, you don't want to remove the flaming either. Because, yeah, when we see batteries that are burning, we're not worried. It's fine. If we see a battery that is not burning and it's releasing a lot of gas, then we start to get worried. Okay, yeah, that's a tricky one. That's a tricky one. As a fire engineer, I don think we we can tell our clients that as long as it burns it's okay yeah ideally you keep you keep the fire burning but you cool the battery cells around the burning fire so that they don't get involved but yeah i i think the strategy that you mentioned uh isolating the the item on on fire and in case of a car park isolating the vehicle in fire from the other parts of the car park this actually could could be a valid strategy to provide safety because um oh you know car parks also designed the ones that have installations in them, like sprinklers, smoke control, and everything, they are designed to handle a single vehicle fire. And usually, I would not expect it from a single vehicle. I would not expect damage to the car park that would be dangerous for the entire car park. The images that we saw were the buildings were destroyed, like the airport in Norway. These were huge fires involving multiple vehicles, or like Liverpool in England, or we had such a fire in Warsaw as well. The funny part about the Warsaw fire is that there went a rumor that it was caused by an electric vehicle. It was not, as far as I know, it was never confirmed. And it was just something that started running around the Internet, you know, when the fire happened in Warsaw. And the next day, everyone was saying that electric vehicles destroy car parks. And the severity of the fire is because there was an electric vehicle inside. And all these crazy things that are very difficult to debunk from a perspective of time. Because they are so powerful images that they come to the mind of the person. And it's difficult to say that it was just fire dynamics, not necessarily a fact that a vehicle was fueled by this type of a fuel, right? I know we are running short on time, but I had this one more question to be asked. One thing that really differentiates the way how we use electric vehicles from internal combustion vehicles in car parks is that we charge them in our car parks, and charging is a process. we charge them in our car parks. And charging is a process. If you leave vehicle and it's idle, it's shut down. I think it's a different state than when you plug it in and charge it for many hours. In your studies, did you see differences in, I don't know, occurrence of the fires or severity of the fires when charging was involved versus idle vehicles? Well, usually when we have seen fires that occurred with vehicles that were being charged or while they were being charged was that the fire was not related to the battery pack, rather improper electrical installation of the charging stations, so that the fire started in the charging station and from there on spread to the battery pack. That being said, during charger, yes, during chargers, you're putting energy into the battery pack, and while you're doing so, the individual battery cells, they heat up a little bit because of their internal resistance. So in that sense, if one of the cells in the battery pack may fail, the surrounding cells could be at somewhat of an elevated temperature. And in that sense, increase the risk that you get the cascading failure. And when it comes to charging, in theory you can if you if you don't have any safety systems like what what happened with many hoverboards for example uh they did not have any any uh battery management system or any built-in system that prevented them from being overcharged so many people that bought hoverboards they they put them on the charger, they leave them there, and it's just a matter of time until they catch fire. But this cannot happen with electric vehicles. They have such advanced battery management systems and protection systems that as soon as it detects one of the battery cells in the battery pack, it's going beyond any limit. They just interrupt charging. That's the end of it. So you have two safety points. One should be in the charger, one should be in the battery pack is going beyond any limit. They just interrupt charging. That's the end of it. So you have like two safety points. One should be in the charger, one should be in the battery management system of the vehicle, yeah? Yeah, the safest way of charging is to have both the safety built in in the charging system and in the battery management system. There are some like charging types where, charges where you put just a socket in the wall and then you connect that to your vehicle then you only have the safety in the in the battery management system you don't have any safety in the charger itself okay um my neighbor does that and then time to move i think i'm a bit concerned now yeah maybe maybe Maybe I will just build a wall between us. That actually is, you know, in Poland, everywhere we as engineers have to deal with this problem because as we've spoken in the green room, it's difficult to ban this and banning is not a solution. It's not a solution. So in Poland, the solutions are, for example, putting walls between parking slots where electric vehicles are allowed to park to provide a physical barrier between the vehicles. So if one vehicle ignites, it cannot ignite a secondary vehicle through this jet fire, even if it occurs, because there's a physical barrier. And it's very unlikely that the secondary vehicles will burn from the heat emitted from the smoke itself. So in a way, that provides some sort of safety against cascading fire that one vehicle ignites another and another and another. And I think, in a way, sprinkler systems would provide the same role, because obviously sprinklers will not have any impact on the battery itself. But they will cool the gases around, they will after this talk sounds like a very good idea. I have some other ideas, but that's for another episode. And it's not only positive for electric vehicles, of course. I mean, for all, even internal combustion engine vehicles this this can be an issue i mean a part come internal combustion vehicle can also catch fire and um well uh roland thank you thank you so much for for doing this i i've learned a lot about uh about these fires and there's so so many things going through my head how to put that knowledge into practice. And I need to read that on the mission paper, and I'm looking forward to that. So what's the next step for you? Are you still working on battery fires? Yeah, I'm working quite intense on battery fires. We're building a new lab here in Sweden. They call it the swedish electromobility lab um and that that is a lab that is built to to do tests on batteries and we're building it in such a way that we can have an explosion anything can happen and the building will still be be standing um so that's pretty exciting that That's good. And it will involve large-scale fire experiments and stuff like that? Yeah, and all sorts of abusive tests on batteries. We're going for kind of environmentally friendly solutions. Our lab will have a smoke cleaning system, which I know people they like to do tests just out in the outdoor when it comes to batteries so hopefully we can do a good thing for the environment with our lab too that's that's a good that's uh that sounds really exciting and uh i hope that there will be a lot of new developments from rice and and your team in this regard because so far you have provided priceless points of view on topic that we barely know anything on. So yeah, everything is needed. Thank you so much and thank you so much for taking the invite. No worries. See you around. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Bye-bye. Yep, that's it on the interview. I hope you enjoyed that. I certainly did. I've learned so much from Roland and it's going to be very useful to my science and engineering. I was quite surprised that the bigger challenge is when the battery does not ignite, when it just releases toxic gases and flammable gases. But when you think about it, it kind of makes sense. With fire, we can deal. When it's a poisonous cloud, it probably poses a completely different set of challenges. And in the next week, I'm going to take you into a journey through my own research and the research of my group, which is on the rapidly growing fires. the research of my group, which is on the rapidly growing fires. We've taken some artificial design fires that grow to a large heat release rate very quickly, dropped them into a computer model of a car park and compared how they behave and what consequences of this fire we can observe versus something we could call, let's say, traditional design fires for car parks. The results are quite interesting, and we've definitely identified height of the car park as one of the main variables. We've run 480 CFD simulations, so there's lots of findings inside of that. So I hope I'll be able to tell you the biggest findings from that and give you some of my own thoughts on how can we make car parks safe, including electric vehicles in them, with the knowledge we have today, with the best practices as of today. Because I think it's very important we don't have time to wait for all the research to end. And as Roland said today, the developments in battery technologies are probably quicker than the ability of the FHIR community to understand them. So, yeah, we have to work with what we have. And that's the next episode it's going to be about. So thank you for being in here today. I'm welcoming you to the next episode next Wednesday.
