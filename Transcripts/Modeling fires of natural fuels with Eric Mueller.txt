 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. As this episode is published, it's most likely 8th February in the morning, at least in here, which means that's the last day for IFSS paper submission. IFSS is like Christmas for fire science and I am absolutely thrilled to see you all in Japan and see what newest achievements of fire science there are, because that's the fuel for my podcast. And I hope your papers went great, as I assume mine is still in production. It ends up like this every time, and I hope every year it's going to be a little better. I bring IFSS up not just because it's, coincidentally, the deadline for paper submissions, but I think quite a nice thing happened last IFSS, the one that was supposed to be at Waterloo, but ended up in online space due to pandemic. Maybe you recall, if you've attended that, there was this Best Thesis Awards, and there was this guy from Edinburgh, and he gave like BBC style documentary about his research, and everyone expected a PowerPoint. And that was absolutely outstanding scientific communication. And on top of that, he was presenting some really, really good science on burning living material, plants, vegetation in that form. But the material that comes from living plants. And I enjoyed that talk a lot. Now, fast forward a few years later, I really need this knowledge because we're working on green wall systems, and suddenly we realized that burning plants is not exactly the same thing as burning timber or burning plastics. We need to upgrade our knowledge, and you know what? I have a podcast, and I have a privilege privilege to get me the best people to learn from. So I did reach out to him. His name is Dr. Eric Miller. He's working at NIST now. And he's still researching vegetation fires and living fuels and tries to update the ways how we model them. So I took all my tough questions. I've asked them to him, and here's the recording of that. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show.

And now, back to the episode with Eric Miller. Have fun. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm today with Dr. Eric Miller from NIST. Hey, Eric. Great to have you here. Hey, thanks for having me. And we have a lot to talk about, stuff to differentiate, build environment, and then wildfire science. And in particular, I would love to talk about modeling living fuels or just modeling vegetation in this podcast episode. First, I would love to hear your professional story, how you ended up into wildfires and what are you doing now with this? I mean, I guess the story to go back is it starts in my undergraduate degree, which was engineering physics, basically applied physics. I think it's a great degree to get some fundamentals, but probably more suited to graduate school than to going out and finding a job. You miss some of that practical education you might get in traditional mechanical engineering or something like that. And so I was looking at graduate programs. I was based in Boston, was trying to do material science and was looking at the website of WPI and their material science webpage was broken. And so I started clicking around. I discovered fire protection engineering that way. And I thought, well, that sounds interesting. And then it so happens to coincide with Professor Albert Simeone when he was starting his first round of being a professor there at WPI. And so I went to meet with him to, you know, see about being a graduate student. And he, of course, is an expert in wildfires. And that started kind of my interest, particularly in that space. And I've always had a love of, you know, the natural environment, being outdoors and everything. So the fact that I've been able to go do these big field experiments and be out in the woods and everything, I love that. So that's how I took off from there. And yeah, I ended up in Edinburgh following Albert Simeone over to Edinburgh to do my PhD, stay there for a postdoc, and now I've come back to the US to work at NIST to kind of carry on the wildfire research and particularly around the modeling. So it's not light physics turned into wildfire, I guess. That makes it even better. That makes it even better. So Eric, you have studied a lot of fuels. I remember your paper from IFSS. We all remember the brilliant presentation of that. That will never be forgotten. You've set the standard too high for the rest of us to compete. Thank you for that. But it was really great. If you haven't seen it, the link is in the show notes. It's definitely worth having the visual component to the great audio. Here we just have the audio. I would love to learn about modeling vegetation. So let's first try to make an introduction how modeling pine needles or a tree differentiates from modeling just, I don't know, solid piece of timber, which is also an organic material. And I would assume many processes are similar in each other. So what's the big deal? What's the difference? Yeah, sure. I mean, I think that's a good context to start in because we might think of, yeah, whether it's pine needles or even branches on a forest floor or something like that, some dead material that's wood. Effectively, from that more material or fundamental chemical sense, probably not very different physics going on in terms of looking at the ignition around the decomposition, the thermal decomposition, how it's pyrolyzing and what sort of gaseous species it's creating and how that's burning. Of course, that's, you know, I'm simplifying. There's some nuance. We can say, you know, if we look at timber in the built environment and some timber on the forest floor, not terribly different. So where are the big differences coming from? And I think it really comes down to A, the environmental conditions that these materials are going to be exposed to. Of course, moisture is a huge thing, the potential moisture content of these different fuels. And again, we get to dead fuels, the range that they can have is dictated sort of by this fiber saturation point, similar to what you would find with timber in the built environment. So you can get up to, you know, maybe 30, 40% moisture content, but it's going to vary a lot more seasonally or as weather patterns blow through a certain area than what you would find in the built environment. So you really have to consider this whole spectrum of very, very low moisture content all the way up to 30, 40 percent. Of course, it's the wind that you won't typically have to deal with inside of the built environment, but how that's going to affect certain processes that will, let's say, alter the ignition behavior. So whether that's driving convective heating or cooling or the mixture of gases or providing oxygen for oxidative processes like smoldering. So all of these things come into play when we think about the wind. And then beyond the environment, we also have the structure of the fuel. So think about just one log, maybe that's not so different from a slab of timber. But as we start to get finer fuels and these sort of fuel matrices or fuel layers, like pine needles, as you mentioned on the forest floor, now we really have a problem of porous media. And so we start to have to think about all of the complexities that come into understanding porous media, where we have this mixture of air and solid and, you know, proportions matter, but also the sizes of, say, your elements. You could have two materials with the same overall porosity, but made of very thin pine needles or very thick sticks, like in a wood crib or something and there's going to be you know different behaviors there because we have maybe thermally thick or thermally thin we have different potential for convective heating or cooling re-radiation so there's a lot of complexity that comes into the mix and we have this porosity introduced in in your ifss talk you you had this example where you've walked with a cell or finite element and put it on a tree to illustrate what does it mean that there's a fuel inside. I'm actually going to make it into the cover of the episode so everyone knows what we are talking about. So if you went to this episode and seen the cover, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And so that's a very, very good illustration on the issue with modeling that computational fluid dynamics tools with finite volume or finite element methods. Because in a finite volume, the assumption is that it's uniform in its whole volume. It's just one block of matter that exists and is wholly at the same state. Whereas with these tiny needles, you have a set of really tiny elements that itch with its own physics inside that control volume that essentially burns. The gradients inside are enormous. But for the reasons of efficiency, computational efficiency most likely, we are unable to simulate them at these tiniest, tiniest scales. So we have to assume something for the whole control volume. And that's the really, really challenging part. How does one simulate stuff that's so tiny within quite large quantum volumes in a way that it makes sense? Yeah, I mean, I think, as you say, there's two ways we can make these models more sophisticated, right? Because now we have this very crude representation, we have a coarse model. And so theoretically, we could go the direction of trying to resolve in a lot of detail the actual structure. And, you know, maybe if you're looking at just a tiny piece of a bit of pine litter, you could actually simulate the flow through that whole matrix. But that's not really currently at least sustainable or achievable with the computational resources we have. the computational resources we have. So the other approach is with these assumptions, these approximations, submodels that allow us to describe the exchanges between phases. And I think we have a good starting point. But if we want to make models more sophisticated, as I say, and go that approach, we might need to refine these submodels and figure out how we can describe the fact that it isn't uniformly distributed, even though we're not fully representing what it looks like. And when we are learning that, when you are developing these models with your experiments, you go all the way down to the scale of a single needle, you take a tree branch. How do you approach that? I wonder, like, how deep can you go? Because in my eyes, I see, like, if I want to model a needle, I could make a CFD model of a needle. But then the question is, should I model the boundary layer on the needle and go, you know, from one millimeter finite elements to, let's say, one fortieth of a millimeter elements to really capture the whole structure of the flow around the single needle. So you can really go far into making this very complicated. I wonder how far have you went? How far is sufficient? How far is sufficient? That's a good question. I could tell you more easily how far I've gone, which I think is too far. I mean, the most that we did in detail when I was in Edinburgh is using X-ray CT, micro CT, to scan some samples that were of this kind of pine litter on the order of, let's say, 10 centimeters in diameter of a cylindrical sample, you know, sort of a cone-sized sample. And then you get this really, you know, micrometer resolution, nice 3D image of all of your pine needles in space. And so you could mesh that up theoretically, I guess, and try to model it. I tried a little bit with lattice Boltzmann simulations, but it's well beyond anything I really understand. I kind of gave that up. But I think that's an interesting scale to get to if you do that kind of refined modeling to try to confirm some of the coarser approximations that we would make of, you know, what is a bulk convective coefficient of this whole matrix? We're not even talking about convection around a single cylinder. It's really this whole matrix, effectively. And so, you know, you might be able to simulate something on that scale and try to confirm what you've shown experimentally. But getting into all of the combustion processes, trying to get the degradation of the fuel and the burning and everything at that scale, I think is still a ways away. You've mentioned convection. And in my giant ignorance of the subject of living fuels, I have been recently exposed to those types of problems while trying to do some experiments with green wall facade systems. And now we are, oh boy, we're learning very quickly this difficult world of fire science. And I've learned the importance of convection in these type of fuels. I've learned that it's convection in these type of fuels. I've learned that it's very difficult to ignite such fuels with just radiation because of their characteristics. And I've learned that the convection in them is much more complicated in buildings. We, I guess, as a community, chose to pretend it doesn't matter. We just assume one heat transfer coefficient that goes from euro gold. And it's so convenient, no one's trying to touch that. However, at this scale of fuels, it seems to be fundamentally important to understand the convective heat transfer. So maybe you can enlighten me about the modes of heat transfer. and enlighten me about the modes of heat transfer. And again, if you could compare that to how a piece of wood would be ignited by radiation and convection, what role would this mode play? That would be splendid. Yeah, I mean, sure, if we get down to just flame spread again in something like a layer of pine needles versus a slab of wood. And as you say, it comes down to the scales we're dealing with and how that differs in those two cases. And you have these very fine particles. And as you start to reduce the sort of characteristic diameter of your pine needle or whatever it is, then you're getting into a regime where it can cool very effectively. You have potentially a very high convective heat transfer coefficient for these elements. And so whether that's even just due to natural convection or you have some entrainment due to the buoyancy of the fire itself, or, you know, in a wildfire, you might have a considerable amount of wind anyways. And so it's not certainly not that there isn't radiation and that that isn't important. And it depends on, again, what the problem you're looking at is. isn't important. And it depends on, again, what the problem you're looking at is. That's flame spread in fine fuels versus the potential for ignition of the facade of a structure. You know, we had some big prescribed fire experiments that we had done out in New Jersey in the U.S. And we have a great video of auto ignition of a tree trunk due to the radiation from this big flaming front. So we see these processes. We see radiation playing a big role in certain contexts, but when it comes down to the ability of these fine fuels to ignite, they can just cool very efficiently by convection when they're just being heated by radiation. But as soon as they become bathed in a flame or some hot gases from the plume, then you've lost all of that convective cooling and potentially you have significant convective heating and so even if it's just very intermittent or quick pulses you know there's been a lot of great work from the u.s forest service out in missoula looking at these sort of very high frequency convective heating processes and how they really are important to driving flames but in a lot of conditions. I find that fascinating because that's like the concept that it can so effectively cool by convection while being so vigorously heated by radiation. It's immense. To the listeners, we're talking about heat fluxes of, let's say, 30 kilowatts per square meter that still do not ignite the branch because it has a capability to cool down that heat that it receives. It's quite astonishing because I'm coming from a world where at 25 kilowatts per square meter you have a flashover in your room and the game has ended, right? So that's true. But as soon as you start compressing that, if you have a bed that is not a porous medium, that it loses the capability of compacting cooling. And then you have that. Is it the same for like plants with leaves or is it something very specific to I mean, I think there's been some good demonstrations again from Missoula just looking at clumps of excelsior, shreds of wood, basically, and just compacting them in front of a radiant panel. And there is a point at which you can compress them enough that you reduce that efficiency of cooling. And so it comes back to this whole idea about vegetative fuels and what are the structural components that matter the way that we describe the structure. And so it's the size of individual elements, but it's also the way that they come together potentially in different clumps and clusters. And so if you had a very dense vegetative canopy, then maybe that's not cooling as effective. Okay. That's very interesting. But now as a modeler, and how the hell you do that in a control volume that's like 20 by 20 centimeters? How do you adjust for that? Yeah, so that's the part where I think we need to get more sophisticated with the way that we do things. Because right now, you know, we conserve mass is our starting point. That's what we hope to do. So if you take the same control volume and increase its size and you still have the same cluster of vegetation in it, you're effectively changing its porosity. And so that's going to change the way that it interacts with the flow through drag and convection, the way that it attenuates radiation. And the hope or the way that it's working more or less right now is that we're not looking at just one thing that's a subgrid size so that if you have a tree crown and you represent that with thousands of grid cells or you reduce that a little bit, then overall you're effectively still conserving the same kind of properties in the way that it interacts with the flow around it. But yeah, as you start to push the bounds of that and you're resolving, trying to resolve, let's say, an entire tree with one grid cell, then you're really violating some of these assumptions. They're really oversimplifying. And so there might be ways that we need to look at modifying the submodels. You know, there's ways when we look at flame temperature, gas temperature is a classic one, you know, CFD, right? Whereas you expand the grid cell size, you'll tend to underpredict the temperatures because you're under resolving things like the flame sheet and things like that. And, you know, there's ways to sort of model probability distributions of temperature to help improve your submodels. And so there's things that we can look at with vegetation in this respect. So basically what we need is a bunch of submodels to resolve the drag, the ignition, the heat production within the control volume and hopefully not violate the mass equation and accommodate for the fact that it's burning away. Yeah, exactly. And that's what we have now and the approach we take now is just how can we make that maybe less grid sensitive or less resolution sensitive. Well, you're working at NIST, so I guess you're familiar with this computer code FDS. And I've seen in literature, I think it's even in the examples within FDS, there's this Bosch fire case. I think it's using some sort of Lagrangian particles to simulate the vegetation or fuels, where I guess each branch of it, like pieces of vegetation, are split into smaller Lagrangian particles, which are then spread around within control volumes. Any comments on that way of modeling that? Yeah, I mean, that is most of, or at least half of my day job, I guess, is working on FDS and trying to improve the vegetation sub-modeling there. So the Lagrangian particle approach, I think it's helpful to consider it as like a numerical construct in a way. It's, for the most part, in terms of FDS, it's just a handy way for us to add some exchange terms, some source and sink terms between the gas and solid phase within a grid cell. So there's no real point to have more than one particle within a grid cell because you're just recalculating the same exchange, but you don't have any more information between two needles within one grid cell, right? Because it's the same average temperature. It's the same average flow field. So, you know, the same integrated radiation intensity, all of these things are the same. You're just calculating it twice, one for each needle, whereas you can calculate it once and just weight it by the number of needles that you have within a cell. So I think it's a little bit confusing sometimes for people to look at this and it looks like, oh, it's a tree and all of these particles are needles and everything. And in a way they are, they're representing them, but they're really just placeholders for more of a Eulerian approach where it's just the source and sink within particular grid cells, you know, represent that cell at least. That's very interesting. I didn't know that. So it's more like a clever representation of a fuel that's easier for the user to maybe define. But in the end, as soon as this Lagrangian particle within the control volume is transferred into the fuel that goes into reaction, it essentially means it doesn't matter if it was one, three, five Lagrangian particles. It's now just another burner that's emitting fuel into your control volume and at the scale of that control volume you are burning it, right? Yeah, and everything's just weighted to, again, conserve that mass that you have initially at vegetation. And the same for the ignition conditions of that Lagrangian particle, like they're all solved at the level of that control volume. So if I have seven in my control volume, they should technically ignite at the same exact time and act like one. Right. Yeah. There's no, there shouldn't be any temperature difference between these different particles. Okay. We could have them, you know, weighted, let's say, based on some randomized position within the grid cell to get a temperature. You know, if one pine needle is closer to one side of the grid cell and you have a higher temperature in the next cell, then you can weight the temperature of the particle or what it's exposed to. But for now, the approach is really just to have them in the center of the cell effectively. As you now expose yourself that you're working on this, I'm happy to ask you a hundred more questions. And is the flow field in any way affected by the existence of vegetation in these control volumes in terms of like they produce drag? So it's just a bulk drag force term in the same way that you would have the convective term, you know, applied to the entire gas volume that you have there. It's just based on the density of vegetation you have and the geometry of the particles that you assume, then there's empirical correlations. where we have a lot of work to do, I think, to try to improve the correlations that we rely upon now, or at least confirm their validity across the wide range of plant types and geometry that you see out in nature. A bed of pine needles is one thing. And, you know, if you look at the papers I've had, I've spent a lot of time looking at a bed of pine needles because it is easier to describe in a lot of ways than a lot of other vegetation. But eventually, if we hope to apply this approach to more complex plant types, shrubs, trees, and things that you would find in the wildland urban interface, then we have to understand the validity of these submodels. And to what extent is it important to include stuff like drag in modeling the vegetation fuels? If I omit it completely, am I introducing a huge error to my calculation? Of what importance is that factor? Yeah, I mean, that's a good question, a difficult one, but one we're trying to get a better handle on. Actually, we're putting together kind of a medium-scale wind tunnel here at NIST and do some more studies around plant drag, especially objects are burning and everything. But it certainly depends upon the type of vegetation and the density that you're looking at. So if you have a very low density forest canopy, let's say, then maybe you're not introducing as much air. But if you look at like a dense conifer, you know, think of a Christmas tree or something like, and, you know, you impose some flow on it, you'll actually have very little flow penetrating all the way through the tree and so the kinds of convection that you have on the on the leeward side of the tree for example can be significantly affected by that drag and then if you were to have another tree downstream of that suddenly it's no longer exposed to this kind of ambient wind that you have so yeah i think you can introduce quite a bit of error if you just were to ignore the drag entirely. And once you advance from modeling a single plant to a whole forest canopy, I guess it becomes fundamental from the reasons you just mentioned that you then will have like the first layer that is burning, that's exposed to wind and the rest of the forest shielded from the wind, right? Yeah, I mean these things you should be able to kind of stack up the effects and you can see the attenuation of the forest shielded from the wind, right? Yeah, I mean, these things, you should be able to kind of stack up the effects, and you can see the attenuation of the flow into the canopy. And it depends on the scale you're looking at, but you can get away with perhaps less description or detail in the description you have of the actual canopy. So you look at, like, there's been a lot of work done around just flow profiles in forest canopies as you can imagine for sea dispersion or carbon exchanges and in forests and things like that like this and basically they just model the forest canopy as a layer a homogeneous layer and it will vary vertically to represent the canopy and maybe you have a sub canopy space but you're not looking at tree to tree gaps and things of that size because eventually deep within a forest, things typically are homogenous enough that you can get away with that representation. Man, we went far away from boundary layer on a single needle to a huge forest model as a sponge. That's pretty interesting how far science can get you. If modeling drag would be important for the control volume, what about the change of drag as the vegetation burns out? That's another interesting aspect. What happens as it's changing? Because it's a very transient phenomenon. It will take not very long based on Maryland's Christmas tree burning tradition. It doesn't take a long time to burn the pine tree. So it's very transient, right? Yeah, sure. And the conditions under which it's burning, right? You think about the production of firebrands, and I know you've had talks with other guests about this kind of stuff, and that's going to change how much material you're losing in a given instance because things will just be mechanically detaching and flying away and so you're losing a lot of drag that way potentially. So capturing that is difficult let's say but again something that we're trying to get at more experimentally first and then you know build some more sophistication into the self-models we have. We can represent it if you want now you you know, effectively as mass goes away then the drag coefficient has to or the drag force let's say has to adapt to that so it will effectively reduce its drag and there's even ways to kind of hack in the detachment of particles and everything like that but, you know, we prefer it to be based on some better understanding of the physics. And are you doing these measurements in like wind tunnel burning trees? Yeah, yeah. Well, that's the plan moving forward. That's going to be fun, man. That's interesting. Going back to the smallest scale, so I understand the complete image of how one models fuel. What about the chemistry, the kinetics, the pyrolysis, evaporation of moisture content? How do you introduce that? Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. And that's a whole other side of the complexity, which I think we have a lot of questions to answer. And I would say it's a big field. There's some excellent researchers looking at this kind of work. But it's also a field where we have some established techniques that we can apply from, you know, traditional, more traditional built environment fire engineering, right? So the same kinds of apparatus you would use to get at some fundamental parameters of, you know, heat of combustion or look at the specific heats and the different degradation peaks in a TGA or DSC. And so, you know, we can apply all of these tools and come up with some different pyrolysis models. And again, there's a whole range of complexity there because there's really so many reactions occurring in pyrolysis. So do we treat that as just kind of one broad reaction? That's when we get to larger scales where people try to apply these models, that tends to be the approach because there's just so much going on that it's hard to get into the details here and we're not even certain that the sensitivity around some of these details is such that it warrants 13-step reaction that's still kind of a big question right is what level of detail do we need to go to in the sort of degradation kinetics, for example, or in the combustion chemistry. So I think it's just an iterative process, right? As we figure out more about the structure and how we can model at that scale, we can then apply some of these more fundamental kind of chemical models and look at the sensitivity between the two of them and advance from there. When we are doing studies in the built environment, we have this, let's say, array of tools that are typically used from cone calorimetry to identify the ignition and the fundamental aspects of combustion of elements through, say, single burning item, which is a test where you test the performance of an element of a building till like large scale furniture calorimeters where the whole things would be burned at once to identify large scale behavior what was what's the pathway in in wildfire research for development of fuel models you use the same tools or how do you approach that yeah i think a lot of the same tools are certainly useful and applicable. There's, again, on the material side, then certainly there's a lot to be learned. And on sort of the medium scale side, I would say, sort of a furniture calorimeter, then I think, again, there's a lot that can be done to characterize the burning of individual items. And then, you know, you don't have to go to the full complexity of the sort of FDS CFD model we've been talking about just because, you know, that's what I'm familiar with. But, for example, again, in Missoula in the Forest Service, I know they're working on sort of, you know, next generation operational fire spread models. And that's based on measurements of burning rates of, you know, different core structures at kind of that medium scale. So there's a lot that we can learn from these, you know, kind of engineering tests. The issue or the caution I would give is kind of to the space in the middle of, let's say, the cone scale, which again, I think there's a lot that we can learn about flammability and things like that. And particularly maybe in porous litter structures or, you know, dead fuels like the pine needles we've been discussing. But the issue, perhaps without applying some of that knowledge to the full range of complexity of structure we have, is when you create this sample to put in the cone, how does that compare to the structure that you have in a real tree? Are you taking apart the needles and putting them in a basket? Or are you putting a single branch and putting them in a basket or are you putting a single branch and just kind of holding it in the cone? And then is it really exposed to all the same heat flux? And so apply the same methodology to understand the ignition of it. And so just the fact that we don't have these kind of nice planar objects or nice geometric configurations that we have in construction materials, I think makes it not unuseful or unhelpful to apply these tools, but we just have to be cognizant of how we're applying the results that we get and how that compares to the real structure we find in a forest. Yeah, that's what we've learned the hard way by trying to do the cone on the plants. It just behaves a little different due to a lot of reasons that were already mentioned. And I also know that in wildfire science, they're using these interesting holders that initiate the porosity of the fuel and load some air to go through. That's also a very interesting concept. But also in wildfire science, as you mentioned, the environmental conditions that are important from first the moisture content, but I guess that you could mimic with normal tools of built environment. But the other, the wind is one thing that seems very fundamental and it is not very important. It is important in building fires, of course, that wind completely changes the compartment fire dynamics, and no one's questioning that. But we just don't apply that during most of our object tests for building environment. Whereas in forest fire, it seems to not have much point to do at no wind conditions. do at no wind conditions because if wind is so impactful to the penetration of the fuel with the heat and the ignition and everything, it's paramount to have wind included in this large-scale research. There's one complexity, but also the slope. As you mentioned, the slope will also act because the way how the stuff will be ignited, that's well known that slopes are fundamental for that. So I guess you also need a lot of outdoor research because I don't think you have a sloped full-scale wind tunnel yet to play with it. Yeah, not yet. That would be something. That would be something, right? Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, I think it's important to always try to connect to this larger scale understanding. And I've been fortunate in my own research to get to go out and do, you know, large scale tests in the forest. And I think you know yourself how challenging they can be, but how rewarding it can be as well. And, you know, so we've had a lot of fun trying to pull these off. But they're good for what they're good for, right? You get conditions which are, let's say, more realistic, although in a wildfire, I'm not sure that we'll ever have a planned experiment that has the same intensity of an uncontained crown fire, let's say. But you're getting closer to real conditions. So that's great. Your observations are becoming more relevant, but you're losing so much control over the input variables and whether or not you can manipulate them in a way to get some findings that you can actually relate back to your models, let's say. So there's some difficulties there. I just had Rory in the podcast and he had this crazy idea of putting a piece of forest on a scale and just measure the mass loss during this experience. That could actually work. That could be funny. Please tell me more about the experiments. I recall these beautiful videos that you've shown from inside the forest fires, in which you were not only observing the spread of a fire inside the forest, but also measuring the conditions at which this spread occurs. What was learned from this experiment and how it relates to these attempts to build some sort of surrogate models that will help us understand the virus of forests better? Probably what was learned, the most valuable finding was how difficult it is to do these experiments and how maybe we need to instrument them moving forward. It is challenging because you have a field model, right? And so you want to have, let's say, field measurements of temperature or species concentration or heat fluxes. You want to have point measurement all over the place. And in the forest, it's just very difficult to get out there and lay out these instruments and have them operate successfully and even know exactly how the fire is going to spread once it's been ignited. You know, the wind is just going to do what it's going to do. But I think the key was trying to connect these larger scale observations, which are a little bit easier to make in such a big test. So just what is the spread rate of the fire and, you know, maybe what does the fire contour look like? We had some nice remote sensing, some aerial imagery, so we could look at, you know, the actual shape of the fire and the depth of the fire front and everything. And so these are nice kind of macro scale comparisons that you can make if you then go do some modeling. But because our model is attempting to describe these things based on much more fundamental processes, we also want to have measurements of heat fluxes of flow really in and around the fire front. And so we tried to get at that with these experiments. It would be nice to do a lot more and get a lot more measurements. And how does a successful model look like? Like, what should it achieve? Is it about predicting the spread rate? Is it about predicting the size of the fire in terms of heat emitted? Is it a model that predicts the amount of smoke produced? When would you say that, okay, my model is successful at doing this? Yeah, I mean, certainly it's application specific, but I think two big objectives are, as you mentioned, the spread rate is a big one. That tends to come more on the operational side of things. You know, If you're deploying firefighters to an actual fire and you want to know where it's spreading and how quickly. And so it's still important for these detailed CFD models, but it may not even be the main parameter that you're interested in getting is the spread rate. But I think it's important to be able to... Sorry, but the large scale spread rate, like within the forest, how many meters per minute or whatever the unit is on a large scale, not necessarily just on a pine needle, how quickly a pine needle burns out, right? So that spread rate. Yeah, yeah. And certainly you want to try to get that spread rate to be able to predict that accurately. But there's also a lot of complexity going on in the model. And so I think it's very easy in a way to achieve that spread rate for the proper reasons or with errors canceling out incorrect submodels. And so then I think the next step is if you're able to characterize it, which is difficult in the field, but getting that heat release rate or getting some metric of the energy release or the burning rate. So when we do this in the lab, the other thing is, you know, put it on a load cell or whatever, or as Rory said, maybe you could put a forest on a load cell and you can get that burning rate. Then that gives you a little bit more confidence that the spread rate you're getting is because you have at least the right energy release from the fire. And then of course, you can get into more details details about are you getting the heat fluxes right that are driving the spread rate and all of this but you know for the end goals for the objectives we want to achieve i think being able to supply that information about spread rate and about energy release because then you can say something about the buoyancy and predicting the smoke products somehow accurately from a combustion model would be nice, but we can at least approximate what they'll be from certain materials and then supply this energy release and an emissions factor to some larger scale model, let's say, and they can look at, you know, long range transport of the smoke. So I think being able to get that heat release rate. And what's the end use of that? Is it preparedness? Is it a response? I mean, for a very detailed kind of CFD model, I would say not for response. Yeah, much more so for preparedness. We're trying to work a bit more with NIST, with some fire managers and look at prescribed fires and help them when they go and plan how they're going to prescribe fire, where they're going to light the forest and what ignition pattern they're going to use. Those are the kinds of things that you have potentially a lot more time to study ahead of time, and you have these kind of idealized design scenarios. You know, what if I do this? What if I do this? And so you have the opportunity to actually run a more detailed model, and you might need some more detail in your model to be able to understand the interaction, say, of two fire lines. If you have two simultaneous ignitions, how do those come together? If you don't have enough detail on the interaction between the atmosphere and the buoyancy of the plume, then you're not going to capture that. So we're trying to find some middle ground of capturing enough physics to give the sorts of answers that fire managers are looking for, but not requiring a research-level project every time you want to get that answer. As a smoke control engineer, I must ask you about smoke, and we just kept talking about fire. To what extent are you capable of modeling the smoke production in such fires, and to what extent are you able to scale from your bench research to real forest fires? Quite crude right now, or at least what's been done. I think the capability is there to improve this. So you can actually look at or try to solve for the conditions that you would have different parts of the fire. You can get some very deep flame fronts, let's say, and so you can have very different oxygen conditions and you can have a certain amount of fuel that's consumed in smoldering behind the flame front and so on. And so there's, you know, some rough emissions factors that you can look at now that maybe will help you understand how much of a certain product you're producing, you know, under this condition or that condition. But if we can provide some greater detail in terms of what is the actual oxygen concentration deep within this flame front, and for how long are the fuels exposed to that and under what heating conditions, then we can provide some more detail. But then we have to connect that back to the detailed chemistry, which for now, we've kind of put to the side just to, you know, focus on the flame spread. So I think think it's a long-term objective but we still have some work there to get a better prediction of actually what is produced that's a really interesting world of fire science like one hand you know all these complexities that are related to the tiny scale of the parts of your fuel on the other end, the necessity to have a bulk representation of that to make it useful, quick, reliable, robust, especially when you encounter predictive modeling and you would like to give real-time considerations to the firefighters on the front. You cannot tell them, okay, now give me three weeks because my CFD must calculate. It kills the point. So a very interesting set of challenges to overcome. As we're transitioning to a more, let's say, sustainable world, or maybe we're just more considerable about sustainability in a built environment, I know from my own example that implementations of technologies, I know from my own example that implementations of technologies, including living walls, like green wall systems, green roof systems, there's a huge rise of that amount of solutions. areas, more and more fire engineers are involved in some sort of design or considerations related to the threats typical for such areas. My prediction is that more and more fire engineers will have to, with vegetation or living fuels, you who has crossed that path, what would be your advice for the fire engineer who is suddenly exposed to having to deal with life or vegetation fuel in their professional career for the first time? What's your advice? I think I would try to look at what's been done perhaps more in the wild and urban interface context because it's at least a bit more mature of a field in some ways, perhaps than living walls, let's say. And there you can at least get some sense of what we understand about, say, vegetation flammability. And there's some good work going on to understand rather than telling people we can't have any plants around their house in the wild in urban interface, maybe plants of this species will be more appropriate, less flammable than plants of another species. And so try and understand what are the kind of broad parameters that describe that plant that make it less flammable. That's perhaps a good starting place. And then, yeah, I think you just have to try to be aware of the complexities that make these materials different from what you're used to encountering so you know getting back to the porosity and then unfortunately with living fuels like a green wall it gets even more complex than kind of the dead fuels we've talked a lot about and there's there's a lot that's just not known yet i think or you know we have a broad understanding of of a lot that's just not known yet, I think. Or, you know, we have a broad understanding of the complexity that's there, but maybe not a good description of the physics behind it. You know, we have observations of live fuels burning still with a lot of moisture content or still releasing a lot of moisture, which is not the way that we describe how dead fuels burn, at least in our models. We see there's some studies showing that the flammability of live fuels can actually increase with moisture content over certain ranges. And so, yeah, there's a lot of complexity there, which is a little bit outside of my wheelhouse. But I think we just have to be careful moving into the space to be aware of how different it can be from the materials that you probably use to work. Two things I've learned working with these green wall systems and station fuels. One thing is that the fact that at the beginning of your fire, the plants were very moist does not guarantee you that they will not dry out during the fire. And fires seem to be pretty decent at drying out plants. So if it goes for long enough, it's going to be dry enough to ignite. That's one thing that we've learned and quite interesting to observe. The second thing is ivy. Ivy plant, it's ridiculous. We cannot dry the damn thing. It just refuses to drop its moisture content. That's an amazing plant. I was astonished, like, seeing other plants around on the wall being like dry you could crack them in your fingers and this damn thing refuses to die. It's so resilient. It's fascinating to observe that. Probably more fascinating for us than for the ivy. It's certainly an interesting world that I was maybe not very ready for. Yeah, and I think that's where a lot of this complexity comes in then with the live plants, is it's no longer just wood, let's say, chopped up and rearranged into different interesting structures, and now the actual plant physiology and morphology comes into play. And does it have something like a waxy layer, like certain plants have to really encapsulate that moisture? And then that can affect how it actually then releases the moisture when exposed to a high heat flux. So things get vastly more complicated pretty quickly. And we didn't even go into like firebrands production and what happens in the complex fuels where you mix different sorts of like plants. in the complex fuels where you mix different sorts of plants. You have bush layer, you have crown layer, the interplay between the scales of the forest fire. There is so much more to unravel here. Eric, thank you very much for this insightful talk. I think for anyone who would have to deal with vegetation fires or living fuels, I think it was very interesting to learn about some sort of complexities that I don't think I would, I know I did not consider when dealing with my building fires. I've just learned them really recently, exposed to this new, fascinating and difficult world. Thank you so much. I'm going to link your IFSS paper and the video. It was the award for the best thesis by the IFSS. So congratulations on that. That's actually quite a big achievement. of the work that you have been doing, if someone would like to take a next step and just go and read something immediately, what would be the first thing that comes to your mind someone should go and see after this episode? Well, actually, I was just looking at Wildland Fire Behavior. It's a textbook that came out not so long ago from Missoula, from the U.S. Forest Service, Mark Finney, Sarah McAllister, Torben Grump, and Jason Porthifer. And if you're interested in kind of getting into the space of these different fuels and understanding what's important, I think that's a really nice textbook that kind of gives an overview of a lot of the topics that we've been covering and probably in much greater detail. I cannot fit much into one-hour podcast episode, but it's a good starting point for everyone. I'll link to that book, and maybe we'll find together some more resources to share in the show notes so people know where to go to. Eric, thank you very much for coming. All the best in your developments of surrogate fuel models for FDS. Actually, I would love to have a really good fuel model within FDS. I think the whole community would benefit from that. So I'm looking forward to your achievements at NIST. All the best, and thank you for coming to the FireSense show. Thanks so much for having me. Cheers, man. And that's it. I told you it was going to be good, and I got answers to all my questions, which makes me very happy and actually helped us proceed with our research, for which I'm very thankful to Eric. After finalizing the recording, Eric contacted me as he was reflecting on our discussion related to the grid size and porous media, you know, the one that's on the cover of the podcast, and he said that there's one more concept that needs to be clarified. So if all vegetation is contained within a numerical cell and it is increased in size, in fact, the porosity must go up because we need to conserve mass in that cell. But if instead we split the cell in half, we would have half the volume and half mass in each cell, so porosity would not be changed. So when we have many cells across a piece of vegetation, generally we can make small, moderate adjustments to their size and conserve porosity, which from Eric's point is a key variable. So in the end, the grid sensitivity, maybe we have a little overstated that and it can be used to play with the models and conserving the things that matter. So that's additional clarification from Eric, I think an important one and I hope useful one. Back to the episode itself, I hope you got something interesting from it. I was absolutely shocked to learn, but maybe not shocked, I was surprised by my ignorance that the convective cooling makes such a big difference in living fuel fires. And I mean, they tell you that, you take it as granted, but only when you see these samples not igniting from really large heat fluxes imposed on them, you start to realize, wow, this is really impactful on the fire behavior of the whole system. So definitely the biggest learning for me, and I hope you also got some learnings in here. Now, that'll be it for today's episode. I guess I should go back to my IFSS submission now. After this episode, I'm even more pumped up to get a good IFSS paper. These conferences are just amazing. And yeah, that's the home for fire science. So I guess that's a good place for me to be. So thanks once again. See you here next Wednesday, and hopefully see you in Japan, Tsukuba, in October. It's going to be great. Cheers. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening, and see you soon.
