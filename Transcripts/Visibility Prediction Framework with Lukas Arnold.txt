 Hello and welcome to the FHIR Science Show Session 30. Wow, this goes so quickly. Today we're celebrating a new achievement by my team and the team of my dear colleague, Professor Lukasz Arnold from Germany. And it's hard to call it an achievement yet, but it's definitely a good step towards a better future. And that is we've got the grants together. We've got quite a prestigious grant from the Polish National Center of Science, NCN, and the German EFG agency to research visibility in smoke. And that makes me so excited because that's a subject that was with me through my whole scientific career, more or less. I've spent so much time investigating how it's being applied in modern fire science engineering. And unfortunately, we found more problems than good things about the model that is used today. And yeah, we were thinking about this, writing papers about it, discussing it. And from all of these discussions, we came to a conclusion. This needs to be done from the start. This needs to be completely redone from the fundamental experiments that led to the emergence of this model. Exactly one year ago, we've spent so much time with Lucas writing the grant proposal. It was one of the most intensive parts of my scientific career, but we really got something nice. And the reviewers said it is very nice. The funding agencies said, okay, we'll fund it. And here we are on the brink of new epoch for visibility in smoke modeling. I hope it will be as good as we make it look. So in today's episode, we want to celebrate this. We want to share this with you. We want to tell you about how this grant was born what were the fundamental issues with the visibility in smoke model that we we thought that it is necessary to do it from scratch what are we planning in the experiment and how this may be useful even beyond what we've applied for and all of these things look very, very interesting. Now, a few things about my guest, Lukasz Arnoz from Jewish Forschungszentrum and from the University of Wuppertal. He's actually a physicist that came into the field of fire science, so he's much better at understanding the fundamental of physical models than I am, and that makes me actually very happy in relation to this grant. Lucas is also known for his skills and his activities in the field of computational fire modeling. If you have ever heard about the Ulish Summer School on FDS, he's the creator of that. And I would highly recommend to have your eyes open because I think there may be a new addition over the corner. to have your eyes open because I think there may be a new addition over the corner. And Lucas is also so skilled with programming and developing new models, and all of them are open source, so you absolutely need to check his repository. And this is the skill set that complements our capabilities at ITB, where we focus mostly on experimental fire science. So if I got your attention and you're eager to learn about how are we going to try and change the visibility in smoke model, let's spin the intro and let's go. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Welcome to Firesense Show. I'm today with my good friend, Lukasz Arnold. Hi, Lukasz. Hi. And we're here because we got it. Yes, Lukasz, we got it. Yes. We got quite a nice grant from Polish and German funding agencies, NCN and DFG, to help us or allow us to pursue a completely new approach for modeling visibility in smoke. And that makes me very excited. How about you? Yeah, me too. So this is really a good achievement for us. We are also a very young group. So this is really, really good. So this will now allow us to do things we couldn't do before. Because, well, eventually in the end, you have to pay for all the stuff you want to do. Even if it's just theory, you have to have people to do it to implement the ideas. I'm really much looking forward to it. And I think the collaboration, like having two partners focusing on numerics and experiments, is a natural good combination. Yes, it's going to be very exciting. You're going to learn or you're going to hear a lot about this project today. And quick announcement, we will be looking for postdocs so i'm gonna have a postdoc position for my experimental part and lucas is going to have a one or two how many you have one one one postdoc yeah the application is on my desk over there so uh it's gonna be out in next few days or depending on the internals so If you like what you hear, you can work with us as a hint. Okay, so let's move to the topic. The name of our grant is Visibility Prediction Framework and Next Generation Model for Visibility in Smoke and Build Environments. That was the fancy title we came up with and yeah, the idea is there. We need a new generation of visibility in smoke models because from what we think the current models do not really work well what's your opinion lucas are you happy with existing models it probably needs to start even further out yeah i'm a physicist so i'm more interested in really what's physically going on. But when you are designing buildings and assess life safety, then you often see that visibility is one of the issues, one of the sustainability criteria that is hard. And what makes it different to other things like gas temperature or radiation is that visibility is something that is way more complex than the other ones. Okay, we're not talking about the physical details, but in visibility, you have to take care about, first of all, how your aerosol suit is transported, how does it get generated, what forms does it have, and so on in your room. But on the other hand, what you're interested in is not only the suit concentration or whatever you locally have in your room, but how does this impact the humans? Will I, during a fire, be able to see that sign? And this is where physics is lost, or at least this is where humans come into play. Okay, so how do they perceive this sign? Is it now, is it visible? Can they really get the information that the sign wants them to have or not? Therefore, you see, this is a very complex topic. We've got different levels with humans and physics and modeling and all these things. And light interaction, which is also not on multiple layers. Exactly, yeah. So there are a lot of things. And I think right now there is a lot of room for improvement on many scales. We see that we cannot reproduce light absorption in room scale simulations or together with experiments that we did. And when you go back, there's Vojtech, your part, I don't want to talk too much about that, but like how many, how do people perceive these things everything probably most of the audience knows jinx experiments which are the base for everything right now uh regarding invisibility how human perceive science and so on yeah and this is now old from my perspective the reason why in general my my scientific career went into the route of visibility in smoke because it's not the first time i'm touching this subject was the fact that every like every single building we have designed literally every single one of them visibility in smoke would be the first one of tenability criteria to fail when you're doing science and your visibility goes down to zero you can still investigate temperatures and it can be interesting and so on but when you're doing science and your visibility goes down to zero, you can still investigate temperatures and it can be interesting and so on. But when you're designing a building and your visibility falls below the tenability criteria, everything else does not matter anymore because your tenability criteria has been breached. Your available safe evacuation time is now defined by the moment when this happened. And this is your engineering. So in a real building, your fire safety engineering is often in fact visibility in smoke engineering. Like you are doing things to improve this one particular condition that fails the first. So it has this profound meaning for the built environment. This is the FIRE criterion that defines buildings. And if it is so important to us, if we truly design all of our buildings based on this single parameter, I guess we should be doing that correctly because otherwise it would not be a fun story. And the deeper you go into the literature of how this is being modeled, the more assumptions, approximations you see, the more fundamental magic numbers that come into the equation to finally yield this one number that, as you said, represents a hell of a complex physics. Physics of light-smoke interaction, physics of smoke movement, smoke production, physics of the human eye even. Because if you go to the roots of it, there was a critical contrast ratio at some point assumed as a value, which gave birth to all the correlations later on, which we don't even remember anymore. So for me, I always seen, you know, visibility in smoke as, on one hand, extremely complex thing to play with and very interesting, scientifically fascinating. And on the other hand, the thing that drives our buildings, drives my design, And on the other hand, the thing that drives our buildings, drives my design, I am working on optimizing this particular parameter. And this is why when we were discussing this, it was not even that we need to improve the current model. No, we need a completely new generation of the models, completely new generation of the models. Yeah, first, before we talk about what we're going to try and improve in the model or how are we going to try to rebuild it, maybe it would be fun for the audience to summarize how exactly visibility is being modeled today. So Lucas, maybe you can tell us from a physicist and fire engineer perspective, if I do my simulation, I release my smoke in the room, it is there. How do I know what's the visibility in smoke? So first of all, when you start saying you release your smoke and move it there, you already have made a lot of decisions with that. So obviously, there are transport processes and so on, which the normal way is how things are transported in fluids. But you have also then defined how much soot you will induce. So what typically the soot yield is. So how much of your fuel is kind of transferred into the soot. But you also have said what kind of optical properties your particles have. So by this, I mean, what is the particle distribution? What is the shape distribution and so on? Sorry, but these are hidden within coefficients, right? Like the particles would be in the specific smoke extinction coefficient, which we date back to George Mulholland's work. And we have a value for that. Exactly. So there's one single value that you can specify, which is kind of an estimate how the interaction with light will be for a given wavelength. And this value kind of is an effective parameter to cover everything, all the interactions. So disregard if the particles change in shape and if there are other effects that you you want to consider different wavelengths and so on and scattering and so on so this is one parameter to to tackle it all which is from an engineering point of view it's okay to have a single parameter okay you have specified this already so therefore you have specified the optical properties typically in the light absorption. So it means like when light travels through a volume of your fluid, which is eventually containing particles or soot particles, then this will tell you how much does the light get dimmer. So how much light is absorbed by this particle. So what happens typically when I would look into that camera and if there's smoke in between, the smoke particles would absorb the light that's coming to the camera and make me, for example, darker or the whole picture would get darker. So you see, there is a path. There's an observer like the camera in this case and me as an object. Therefore, the way that the light travels is important. Right now, the common assumption right now is a little bit different. So when we go back, you have a compartment, you release your smoke and so on. Then the common way of doing it is that you locally define a visibility. What does it mean? You basically make the following assumption that at a given position, there is a light absorption coefficient locally, which depends on the density and the parameters you have specified before. There's a single value for that. Then you can use formulas. So just how light propagates through an absorbing medium, you can use these formulas to compute how light would, given this coefficient, would be absorbed. But you now assume that this coefficient is constant for this position for the whole room. And then you can use empirical relation like from gin to deduce like what is the visibility, how far would you be able to perceive a sign based on the local value. Yeah, I think that's the key, that the value is local. And I think that's the biggest trap because local, it means that it's a clever way to go from smoke concentration into a value that you can more or less understand, which is the visibility. So if you are standing in a point of your room, you see for a certain distance. of your room, you see for a certain distance. And it makes no sense that in front of you, the visibility would be 10 meters and one meter after it would be 20 meters. It's not that standing here, you see for 10 meters and standing there, you will see for 20. No, it is just such a horrendous simplification of the problem. And actually, when this was developed, and we're talking about early 70s, the groundbreaking work of Jin in Japan. When this was developed, there was no CFT. There was no two zone models even. There was a single zone model for a room. So such an assumption, you know, that you have one concentration of the smoke in the room and you plot one value of visibility for the whole room, it actually makes sense if you assume that the conditions inside are averaged. When you go into two-zone modeling, it also makes sense that you have a smoke layer that spans over the whole compartment, and the average visibility in that layer is this value. It makes sense. But when you apply the same principle into values of smoke concentration, like you have a different value every 10 centimeters in every cell of your model, you have a different value. Then applying the same principle for every single cell in your computer model and then just plotting a colorful picture with the values in any of them, it truly makes no sense. And then if you apply the condition, and we often say that the visibility shall be more than 10 meters, for example, that one is in one of the Polish laws written. If I'm standing here and in front of me, there's a visibility of five meters on a distance of one meter, and then the air is clean, I can see beyond this small cloud of smoke. So I see above 10 meters, but according to my law, I have failed my criterion because the local value has fell below that. So there's an issue, you know, with making a global conclusion based on local value. Yeah, that's true. As I said, there is missing the kind of the path that you're interested in cases be traveling through inhomogeneous media and will then kind of create an image, either dark or blurry of the sign. And this is what currently is not used in the modeling. Yeah, for me that local thing was the main issue from an engineering point of view. But obviously if you look on the subject through the eyes of a scientist, I once have summarized this in a single sentence that we use because we basically use Lambert's beer correlation. And that correlation is valid for homogeneous smoke that is mainly absorbing and it is valid for a single ray of light. When we apply this principle for non-homogeneous smoke, that is a mixture of absorption and scattering, which we don't know, in a very complex light setting of your scene where you're measuring that. So you actually break the law on all three levels, whereas you should have're measuring that. So you actually break the law on all three levels, whereas you should have not done that. And that creates a whole array of issues. And then let's jump into our work of the last years, where we have separately came to more or less same conclusions with different methods, that there's another aspect of this, which is the wavelength sensitivity. I've been building a multi-wavelength densitometers, like the devices that are used to measure the transmittance of the smoke in laboratory. Usually it's being measured in the red light, and that's actually how the value of the smoke coefficient, 8.7 square meter per gram, was devised for red light. However, the different wavelengths will be absorbed in a different manner. So we were building multi-wavelength densitometers, and you have invented this tomographic LED reconstruction method, which is the fanciest term I've ever heard for taking pictures of LEDs through smoke, but it actually worked. So we have found that the green light would be transported through smoke in a completely different way than the red light. And the blue light would be absorbed the soonest. Did you gain the same conclusions? Yeah, we are currently writing. There will be a new publication in the next few weeks at least submitted and hopefully also accepted. So far we did this proof of concept that we published and now we have all the experiments that we did. And yeah, I agree with you on that. But I would like to point out that our goal is a little bit different probably to yours. So you're focusing on the colors, which is very important. We would like, from my point of view, from my CFD modeler, would like to have spatially resolved data that we compare with a spatially resolved model. Because otherwise you're still then comparing individual values. And so the idea is, what I think is working great, is to really measure the optical properties spatially resolved without having thousand probes. And you also figure out the distortion and stuff like that, which is very helpful. Yeah, this is what we work on. This is exactly to not only look into absorption, but also on scattering. Okay, so typically forward scattering, this is from a physical point of view, we cannot do any other kind of scattering with a single camera. Yeah, we look into that and also um like how you would expect from me theory to predict given a particle size distribution what the scattering and absorption would be and for this we we need also the ratios of the different wavelengths that's why we measured now the spectra of the LEDs, which are in contrast to yours, which are peaks. In a laser, an LED is a broad spectrum, unfortunately. But nevertheless, you can do some conclusions about the ratios. And based on these ratios, you can deduce what the particle distribution may be. And obviously, that does not exhaust all the research that has been done in our units. I have a great collaboration with Gabriele Vigne, who was a guest on the podcast here in episode three. And Gabriele has said a lot of nice things about visibility in smoke as well and how we were searching for optimum suit yield coefficient. And recently, we've performed a survey of how visibility is being used over the world, which hopefully we will finish processing soon-ish, I hope. I'm taking a note that we have some to-dos from our last call. Yes. And you were working a lot with Duisburg Essen, who have a history of measuring the sizes, the shapes of particles, and that's also quite fascinating. Yeah, exactly. And they're going to also help us out here in this project. They really do the fine modeling of light particle interactions. So with meteorite and not spherical particles and all this stuff. That's a brief identification of the issues with the visibility and smoke modeling. Wow, that's a lot of issues, actually. It really makes sense to repeat this work, and I'm really happy that we got a chance to do that. Now let's jump into visibility prediction framework, VPF, as we called it, what we will try to do. VPF as we called it, what we will try to do. So we have subdivided this work into like two grant packages, I can call it like that I guess. So what my scientific unit, the ITB will be doing, will be focused on the experimental research on the visibility in smoke. So we're the experimental partner and Lucas, your team will be doing experimental research on the visibility in smoke. So we're the experimental partner. And Lucas, your team will be doing the software development and computational modeling, which is as exciting, I would say, or maybe even more. And with our powers combined, there will come and emerge some really fun tools to use. First, let me tell you a bit about the experiments. And I think it's very interesting what we've planned because in fire science in general, we have these magic numbers that come from ancient knowledge. We have these variables that no one can trace where they origin from. And it's common over the fire science. And invisibility in smoke, everything goes back to a researcher, Tashida Jin from Japan, who was researching this in the early 1970s, who has written some fundamental landmark papers about the perception of shapes through smoke layers. And what did he do was he built a small chamber in which he has burned paper and then released smoke. And that's one funny thing that it was mainly white smoke, where we clearly apply it to a little darkish, sooty smoke. But that's the first issue with this experiment. He was having this chamber. On the end of the chamber, he was projecting some shapes. And on the other side, on the opposite end of the chamber, there were a window and some mirrors. And he simply asked people to identify whether they can see the shape or not through a layer of smoke that was inside the compartment. And by measuring this light absorption, he could correlate whether a person can see something or not with the amount of smoke that is within the chamber. And from this experiment, some really fundamental assumptions for our modeling were born. Because for some certain ratios of contrast between the lighting of the chamber and how bright the sign was, it was able to show that in some cases the sign is less visible. And we currently refer to them as the light-reflecting signs now, and for some it was more clearly visible, which we now refer to as light-emitting signs. He found out these correlations for the constant k, aligns these two, and from this simple experiment we got all the constants for the equations that are being still used up till today. Now, a lot has changed since 1970s. We have so many new tools that allow to precisely measure the smoke properties within the chamber. We have so many new ways to generate smoke even. We have so many new ways to observe with digital cameras and digital imaging. even. We have so many new ways to observe with digital cameras and digital imaging. And definitely we have a much easier time projecting signs than using light projectors and a film. We can just use screens into that. We don't have to use mirrors. We can change the shapes and sizes on our screens. So the technology advancements in the last 50 years were immense and we will try to use them in repeating genes experiment but with modern control and that's like really exciting for me. And how will you use that in your computational part? Yeah, so as always it is important to have good experimental data, a good, I mean, reproducible things, have measured everything that is maybe relevant. So we will use this data to come up with a model to basically allow us in the first step to do something like given a smoke distribution, wherever that comes from, commonly used CFD codes, giving a smoke distribution, whether the particles are treated as a fluid, as they are typically done now, or via a particle representation, that we can create an image of a sign for a given observer at a given position in the room. Okay, so me being here, there is any smoke distribution in this room, and now there is no exit sign here because my office is way too small for that. But imagine there would be one. I would like to compute how the image of the sign would look like. Okay, from a camera, which may be easier, but also from a human perceived. That's definitely an open question, how differences in humans are and so on. But I think a good starting point would be to capture what a camera would. And to do so, you have to get the interaction with light, the soot particles with the light, the reflections, and so on. So based on these images, you can then do the application of that. Okay, so you can deduce from that, is it still visible or not? Do, like in a given experiment, people perceive or recognize the sign or not so that we can use it later on to model what people would think whether they would see the sign perceive it or not and this would then in the end tell you whether the visibility is okay or not because like in the end like the length is one thing but in the end we want to, are the people able to see the exit or the sign or not? This is regarding how far away it is, okay? And if you automate this for given positions and come up with a criteria when a sign is perceivable or not, then this will allow you to draw maps or do an analysis for a given fire scenario, time-dependent, from which positions would be critical, because, for example, you don't see any other exit sign or any exit. Then you're basically lost. And the important thing that will come out of my experience, because I obviously don't want to just repeat Jin's experiment, we want to create an immense amount of new knowledge within them. First, we will invite participants in the study. So we will have real humans, hopefully a diverse group of participants in the experiment, helping us identify whether they can see through layers of smoke or not. But it will not only be a question of do you see a light on the end of the tunnel which we will invite them to look at but we will show them pictures of evacuation signs with letters maybe not exit but we will use words or combinations of numbers and we will ask them to read them out loud in a way like in an optician's test. But what we will do, we will show them small signs, large signs, red signs and green signs. We will show them signs that are very dim compared to the backgrounds and one that like white and black background with the maximum contrast ratio. will adjust all these parameters on the fly to try and capture as many data points as humanly possible within the hours that we'll have with our participants. And this would help us really capture this critical combination of smoke obscuration or smoke parameters and the intrinsic parameters of the evacuation sign and the environment around it when the visibility is lost, when you lose clear grasp on what the information is carried by the sign that we show them. And if we can find out this critical value, then we receive a completely new threshold condition of a sign distortion or dimming of the sign at which the perception is lost. And if you then calculate this value numerically for any place within your compartment based on the light-smoke interaction from a certain observer placed in a certain observer placed in a certain location and you move the observer and you map what would they see in every single point of your compartment and we know the critical value from the experiment. We are there. We have a true map of visibility which means what it says. It is a map of visibility, not a map of fancy recalculated smoke, mass densities in the room. It will truly be the map of visibility. But that sounds like quite computationally expensive. I hope you have some good tricks for that. I'm not sure how expensive it's going to be. Yeah? First of all, most of us are having more resources that we can use than we think. Probably even this tablet has already a multi-core thing in there, and all the notebooks and workstations. And basically, you're also running CFD simulations, which are very complex and need a lot of resources. So I think this will not be so expensive, especially, well, it will be costly, but not that the post-processing will take longer than the CFD situations. Okay. And especially when, so what we plan to do in a first approach, maybe we come up with something clever in the end is ray tracing. Okay, so basically to create an image of something, you can trade the individual photons, if you want to, on the path to the camera or to the observer. There are a lot of tricks how to reduce the amount of work you need to do because you, for example, are interested only in the sign. Okay, I don't care how the wall looks like. I just need the sign. We will't care like how the wall looks like i just need the sign we will use the benefits that comes from gaming okay this is what your game engine does for you when you play a fancy ray tracing game so we can use these techniques which are existing and we will see how we can adopt them so that's something that we will definitely investigate. Right now, these effects, like also absorption, are also integrated in light tracing capabilities. But this is what our experience showed us. It is hard to come up with your own distribution of optical properties, okay? So these things run like with a given fixed property or so. So this is what we see in our VR implementations and so on when we have inhomogeneous media. But yeah, so we can build on top of many things. And eventually, if this runs on GPUs, then this would make things way more faster. And this is the goal, but we will see we need to get the physics and so on correctly and then optimizing codes. That's the second part. But first, I want to reproduce exactly what you, Wojciech, will do in the experiments. We want to have the same pictures. This is the goal. And then making it fast and run it on your computer. Yeah, that's the second step. For me, that second step is quite important because i mean if we are investing so much time in changing the world it would be quite nice if the world would actually appreciate the change and go for that because we're not the first ones to try and and great things with with visibility in smoke there were many smart people before us who were trying to do that and many courageous solutions were developed. They just never clicked. And I think one thing that was very important for us writing the proposal was that we need to couple this to existing common models. We need to have this coupled seamlessly with FDS. We need to have this coupled with Ansys. Not that it has to be a part of FDS. That's not the point. have this coupled with answers. Not that it has to be a part of ideas. That's not the point. But we need to have a very easy way where literally a person presses one button and the simulation is processed and you just obtain a new result. Maybe it will one day be introduced into SmallView or something that will make my day. But we really want this to be user-friendly and you made a very clear statement that if you work But we really want this to be user friendly. And you made a very clear statement that if you work on it, it has to be open source, which I appreciate a lot because I think that's a way where community would be able to participate in it and actually maybe at some point extend our work beyond what we have originally seen, right? Yeah. You know, I'm a big fan of processing data with Python. We do a lot of teaching about that. And we have our summer school where we also do that. So we've got nice tools to post-process this data. Whether these things will make it into SmokeView or not, they will be in the end, or not only in the end, during the whole process will be available for everybody and we will make it easy to use if you've got the very basic knowledge of Python, which is not a click, but like a copy and paste a command and here we go. So we're post-processing FDS data. We've got a very nice tool. One of our team members has written for reading in all different kinds of FDS stuff. It's just one line and then you can access everything. And then if you are interested in special analysis, I think it may not be one click, but it would be one or two lines on a command line or whatever you're using to come up with such maps and so on. So that's something that I see as realistic. And then in the end, it also like regarding the computing time, it also depends like how often do you want this analysis to be done? Like every 10 times a second, which probably doesn't make sense. Like every five minutes or so. Yeah. Or one minute or so. This reduces also the computing cost dramatically. I'm very optimistic that it's going to be usable. We really want to do breakthrough experiments that have never been attempted with a level of fidelity that has never been achieved in this type of modeling. We want to determine the smoke parameters on a scale that has never been achieved in fire science never and then push our numerical modeling capabilities to the edge trying to really replicate images taken through smoke with our model not replicate model them and reach the point where the model can really predict the images. And one way or another, how close we'll get to this ambitious goal, I don't know. I hope as far as humanly possible and we'll do our best. But now let's think about the impact this new model could have for the whole field and beyond buildings because obviously the tool will be able to map visibility in buildings. And that's number one goal, because that is something the fire safety engineering needs. Yeah. If I may add one thing to the buildings. So what we plan here, what we are also seeing right now, that we cannot reproduce the experiments. Simple compartment, real-scale compartment fires with Taptane, we cannot reproduce them regarding visibility with the current models. So I hope, and in our case it's FDS, I mean, it's not the fault of FDS, it's about which parameters you put in, but if you use the commonly used parameters in there, you way overestimate the smoke effect. So you have way lower visibility. Okay, so with experiments which have controlled boundary conditions, where we measure particle size distributions in the compartment, not only at the source and so on, I hope that we will also be able to contribute to better predictions in the building, which I would assume will lead to more realistic, lower light absorption or higher visibility. Okay, so that I think this will be also a huge contribution to make these predictions better or closer to reality. I think it was Ulf Wikstr√∂m who once said that it was not related to visibility, but to structural fire engineering. But it was something like, we should stop calling wrong assumptions safety factors. And that's the same thing in here. We should stop claiming that the model is completely wrong, but at least it gives a safe result. No, it gives you a false image of the building and you cannot engineer with a false image. Exactly. When you have correct image, you can work and engineer. And that's the point. And then you can add your safety factors. And then you can add the safety factors, but you control them. That's the thing. That's the beautiful thing. And maybe let's go further into buildings. If you have a model today, if you model a building today, please tell me what the size of the sign have you put in your simulation? None, because you're not modeling that. What was the brightness of your sign? Well, you're limited to none illuminated or illuminated. Was it on a white wall or on black wall? Because that kind of matters, right? Was it at the height of 7 meters or at the height of 2 meters? Or maybe on the floor? These are the things that if someone asks you, okay, can you please can your CFD tell me if I move the sign from 5 meters to 2 meters, will my visibility improve? Well, that's a question you cannot answer today. Not with the visibility in smoke model. You can do it by engineering the smoke layer and so on, but not with the visibility in the smoke model itself. And with VPF, that will be your outputs. Like the map of visibility will be intrinsically connected with the size of the sign, the color of the sign, the location of the science versus observer, the ambient lighting conditions in the compartment. the ambient lighting conditions in the compartment. And this will help us, like, engineer the evacuation paths. Like, when you go, and my favorite example is Barcelona Airport. Go to Barcelona Airport or Google it and see this insanely huge human-sized evacuation signs that are there. I mean, that is a beautiful solution for fire safe building. You have these signs that you can see from 100 meters and tell what it means, that sign, right? But today, with the tools we have, I mean, you can engineer it, but not with these tools. These tools don't allow you that. Yeah, so I think there would be many contributions for the buildings. Okay, I'll start in a second. The second one that is really fascinating to me, and that was also a reason why I like doing this now. We are at the beginning of the age of virtual and augmented reality. And there will be a growing need for representing smoke in these environments. And today we're not representing it correctly. It is not the smoke. I mean, it looks like a smoke, but the physics of it are completely off. And I think you mentioned gaming. And I think in gaming, it's also a similar issue, right? It needs to look good. It needs to look good, yeah. But the visibility through that cloud is not a representation of the reality. And I think if we make this model work and we accomplish all of these experiments and numerical modeling and we find new efficient and clever ways to model this light and smoke interaction, maybe our colleagues who are using virtual reality for their experiments on human behavior for example, maybe they could benefit from this better or truer, if such a word exists, representation of smoke, right? Yeah. So we have now also a software package or tool that allows you to load FDS data into the Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine. Great. Okay. So this is like now the real numbers. But as you can imagine, it's just, it's the suit density basically. Okay. It doesn't tell you like how well you perceive something. Obviously, you can put in numbers and so. Okay. So the first step to get this number into the engine which was really yeah not that easy is there so then you have the physical data so in combination what we get with properly modeling the light interaction it would be great for people who then do like how do people orient themselves and so on to use the physically based, maybe realistic properties that people can either perceive the sign or they cannot or they cannot properly do it. And not guessing how it is, because this will influence their decisions. OK, so this all is dependent on a good representation of the reality. representation of the reality. And so I hope that this will be a spin-off of that with DVR, providing a platform for this human in fire studies with a physically based approach. So as far as I know, there is a lot of people working on that, which as far as I know, sorry, if I overlooked something, they're using kind of this gaming or pre-scripted smoke and not the CFD-based. I've seen an approach when I visited University of Greenwich. And I saw the research when they were also trying to process that. I mean, they're great at augmented and visual reality. And I was so impressed by the research. But it was also, they mentioned this challenge, to get a realistic image of smoke. And you have to resort to some tricks because a good model does not really exist. And last but not least, we are fascinated by visibility. We are fire engineers, and it's something very obvious in this field of science that this needs research. And we obviously went from this direction. of science that this needs research and we obviously went from this direction but to just measure the optical properties of smoke that is produced in in the flaming fires that is the measurements that are transient you know how the properties change with the age of the smoke to try and capture some soothe the position on on the walls maybe to really see the effects of the particle distribution on the visibility or on the optical properties of the smoke. And I mean the visibility properties or optical properties narrowed down to the visible spectrum of the light which is the most interesting for us and the smoke narrowed down to what is produced in fires. I'm not really interested in tobacco smoke, and I'm not interested in sandstorms. I'm interested in smoke that is an effect of flaming or spoliering combustion. And I'm not interested in microwaves or ultraviolet. I'm very interested in visible light spectrum. All of these things have been researched by other researchers in combustion field, in fields of atmospheric science. And these people have done a great job, but they've never really focused this narrow part of the light spectrum and this narrow part of the particle distributions, which we want to study in the best way we can. Like, we literally have planned every possible measurement technique we know to try and get these visual ones. The lead tomography that you've invented, multi-wavelength spectroscopy that we've got, with gravimetric sampling, from your colleagues, from Julich, the ways to measure the particle distribution. So there's so many tools to be used in this one experiment to really precisely capture the particle distribution and the optical properties that on alone, I hope this will be already a great contribution to the science, not only fire science. And if I may add something, we are speaking mostly about soot particles, but what about water mist? And stuff like that. Don't complicate the grant, Lukas, no. No, no, no, no, no. We're looking here into the extension of the project. No, but I mean, there are people who say, well, one of the issues is visibility in mist. Okay, well, predicting these things is also helpful for new measures. How well a mist system makes a situation worse or will it make it better? Well, the difference will make it better. But, you know, how bad is the limiting of the visibility you missed and so on. So many pathways open and I really hope we will get there. First, let's start with the recruiting process. So if you like what you've heard and you fancy a PhD, or you fancy a postdoc, but I think I will have a PhD student position as well in the grant. So if you... We will decide on a person basis. Yeah, we will decide that on a person basis. So if you would like to work with this team and change the world with us, you are more than welcome to do that. Look up for the calls for the recruitments and yeah. Any final words, Lukasz? No, it's going to be a fun project. Besides all the outcome, it's going to be great to work with you. And it's going to be a great Polish-German collaboration. So we should have done this podcast in Polish. Or in German. After two minutes, I would be already gone. Probably, but maybe I can also improve my Polish by visiting you in Warsaw. That's so great. I can also improve my Polish by visiting you in Warsaw. That's so great. So, yeah. And thank you so much to NCN and DFG for believing in our research, for evaluating this so highly. And we really appreciate all the reviewers' comments we got. I mean, for the first time, I really had a good experience with grant reviews and stuff like that. It was so nice and so on the point. I really enjoyed this process and I'm really grateful for the funding agencies to believe that this is an important topic that may actually change the paradigm in the field of science and I hope we will achieve that. And no matter how it ends, it's going to be fun and you will hear a lot more about that. Oh, for sure. Okay. Thank you, Lucas, for coming to the show. And yeah, let's go back to the work. There's so much to be done. Cheers, man. That's true. Bye. Okay. Bye. See you soon. And that's it. I hope you've liked what you've heard, and yeah, we're a bit crazy with developing all of this and planning such an intense research over the three years. But on the other hand, it looks manageable, achievable, and I've said it many times, if we only do half of the things that we want to do, it's still going to be a breakthrough. And if we do all of them, it's going to be a paradigm shift in the discipline. I have never been more excited about be a paradigm shift in the discipline. I have never been more excited about carrying a research item in my life than now. So I'm very happy to do that. One thing that we will need, and we will need that badly, is the clever people who will do it with us. There are PhD positions in my part, in the experimental part there will be a position in lucas's part which is aimed as a postdoc but i am pretty sure you can negotiate to turn it into a phd research as well and i will have a full apostolic position for three years as well in the grant so there's so much work to be done with us and trust me on that it's gonna be uh one of the top grants in the grants. So there's so much work to be done with us. And trust me on that. It's going to be one of the top grants in the field of fire science in the years. So you want to be a part of this team. Keep your eyes open on the announcements. I'll be posting that on my Twitter, on my LinkedIn. I'll keep you updated when the calls are open. And I guess that's it for the episode. I'm not going to add much to what has been said already. In the show notes, I'll pop you some links to interesting resources on visibility in smoke, both from my team and from Lucas's team, including some YouTube videos where the history and principles of the visibility in smoke model are discussed, and some really nice papers on the recent advancements in measuring smoke properties that both my team and Lucas' team have done. Anyways, thank you for listening. As usual, next episode will be waiting for you here next Wednesday. So let's stay connected. Share the episodes with friends. Please, please do that. Please help me sharing the knowledge about the podcast. See you around. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
