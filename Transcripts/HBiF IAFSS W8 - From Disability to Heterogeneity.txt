Introduction by Enrico Ronchi

So yes, and, as mentioned, this meeting is also recorded, because then we put it up on our YouTube channel. So welcome everyone. I'm extremely happy to be here introducing another speaker in our series of webinars in. The Umbrellas group of the International Association for Fire Safety Science, and my name is Enrico Ronchi and I'm here together with Erica koligowski. Hi, Erica, leading this group, and today we have a talk about visibility from disability to heterogeneity. 
So we will look at people with disabilities but learn more about how their movement and behavior can have an impact on a vacation, and we will try to understand how pedestrian move in a crowd when we consider also people with disabilities. So, as mentioned, we are a group within a permanent group within the International Association of Fire Safety Science, and myself and Eric as being coordinated this since. 
The last Symposium of ifss there was in 2021 postpone because of the pandemic. I just also want to mention our technical support. Arthur Road, that is, let's say, the brain behind the scenes that is making sure that all these webinars functions, and, thanks to him, is a PhD student of mine that helps out with arranging these events, and we are at the eighth eventual webinar series and this is just one of the activities that we have in our group. 
So if you're interested in being in the loop of our activities or being participating more actively, just please join. It is free to join to the mailing list of our group and being updated, and I can see artem now put the link to sign up to our mailing list in the chat and, as I said, then you can express if you just want to. 
Be updated on these type of events, like webinars and so on, or if you want to have also a more active role, because we have again a set of activities that are ongoing, including working on a roadmap on the research in the field of human fires. 
So this is the work that Eric has been leading for some time now, and we will give an update at the next ifss conference that we will have in October in Japan. So there will be an update. So we hope to see you, many of you, in Japan as well, and hopefully we can meet finally in person with many of you that we met online only. 
But let's go and talk about today I'm extremely glad to introduce Paul. Your Paul is a doctor and works as a research fellow at. The Association of Fire Protection Engineering in. Germany and he's engineering Enthusiast for the empirics of pedestrian Dynamics. 
So we go into the world of experiments, which is one of the best part of our of our research field, and his research focuses on the influence of individual intelligentities or movement and its consequences on crowd movement characteristics. So looking from the individual to the crowd, and he's passionate about what individual characteristics in a culture for safe, comfortable movement and our performance is affected. 
Paul will talk about how the movement of homogeneously and heterogeneous compost crowds differ, so ranging from different type of crowds, and what phenomena can be observed and what are the consequences for a vacation planning, because we don't forget that we many of us work with the vacation design, and he Advocates the course to knowledge people's individuality. I use it as an opportunity to create optimized conditions for entire systems. 
So I'm really glad to have you here, Paul, and I just want to highlight how important I think this topic is. So, but I don't really want to steal more time from You. So the plan is the following, and Paul will give a presentation of approximately 40 minutes in the meanwhile during the presentation. 
You're really welcome to add questions in the chat and we will take them at the end in a q a that we will moderate and as I said. So if you're in the talk you have questions, please write them in the chat. 
Otherwise, at the end, when we will have the Q a, we will also give the opportunity to have a, let's say people presenting their questions orally if we have time, because generally we get a lot of questions during the talks. But again, Paul, I don't steal too much. time from you, so very welcome and thank you for giving this talk, so I leave the floor. 


Presentation by Paul Geoerg

Many thanks. Could you see my screen? 
Yeah, yes, okay, great many thanks, Enrico, phones kind introduction, and many thanks to Erica and Arthur and you, Enrico, for invitation and very welcome to everyone. It's an honor to be invited here, the speaker and I think this is a very important webinar, because I think we have part of you opportunities to get all out of our own bubble and learn from other perspectives and learn from each other, and that's why I would like to thank you today. 
On the journey into the empiric of the theater Dynamic and focusing on an interesting aspect of heterogeneity, I will present insight into important findings about pedestrian Dynamics and heterogeneous clouds, and this is what I hope for increased a kind of awareness. to use for use of models and the limitation applying to the files. 
I would encourage you to use a key performance values at what is made for as to it for explanation with conditions and the boundary. But why didn't right? It's important to talk about the difference between science or model and reality. Models are simplified representation for real world and you'll be having fire videos, many different kinds of models, for instance viable lab experiments or computer simulation. 
They are great opportunities to identify and investigate pattern or law and complex relationship, because these models are reduced representations of our reality. We can control their boundary conditions and capital can isolate single effects because the real life is complicated and it is a complex system. Such compact systems are calculus as non linear emergent interaction based self organized setup. That's probably for past or 10 minutes but. 
Combat systems are worthless or service of Their Own for today. I think we it's enough to that. We need to know that we need to reduce complexity in a reasonable way in order to study or to understand from the principles. The key emphasis here is one of the word reasonable, because the trick is to limit the certification to the essential features. This means that the essential elements are included and everything super close is not considered. 
And the most important question here is Which object Properties or features are important in order to just be added to. It is a principle. I will give you now an example. Let's imagine a pedestrian in a shopping mall like me: yeah, yes, here okay, my case not, but I have face arms, have a relative and shoot I've addressed as a complete system May interact nonlinear with my environment. 
Self organized emergency arise from many pedestrians if they interact. So we want to look at the suggestions to analyze its movement. And completely uninteresting for this question is, for instance, the kind of my sunglasses or the color of my trouser? I do not necessarily. No, it did not necessarily determine the movement but may have an influence on my expectativeness to neighbors. But however, we do not want to consider just this property for today. 
In this way, we decompose the compact system into evaluate properties in terms of their essentiality. Often this is an interdisciplinary iterative process that takes many years and in our example we might conclude that development Institution for the movement of the question is my advisable to mention product on the floor and supplemented some information about, for instance, if they're playing with that or my unemployed movement speed. So and this. 
Is our model a model of a pedestrian okay? I would now like to take a look with you at two type of models that we use to generate characteristics in the discipline of pedestrian Dynamics. You will see they are artificial, very controlled situations, very abstract setting, and I want to start with a talk about single pilot experiment, which I'm sorry, the lab experiment for this is people walking in the hallway in a single time. 
The participants walk one after our checking is not allowed performance and participants significantly influenced by what the person in front of them does. We use such design to determine the relationship between the distance and the real potential of the availability, space and speech in different situations. You can see such a relationship here, and even if there are controversial question about the term, it's often part of the fundamental diagram. 
You'll see that from the left to the right, the distance to the person in front of the Quality Hardware, from the bottom to the top of the speed. If we have tested if you want to remove slowly, if you have to have more space, you can go as fast as you like and you are comfortable and at some point you go at the speed where you'll feel comfortable then the saturated. 
Now let's take a look at an experiment in which people walk in into a group, for example through a bottleneck. Overtaking is now allowed and the system is a little bit more now it's no longer a matter of distance allowing. The speed again from the bottom to the top is determine by the space you have available or, if you think of it, as in the world, by the density if you are all. 
Alone the density is low. You can walk as hard as you like. More eight people come along. You have to share your available space. You do that you interact. You adapt the speed of light conditions and the another gets the bottleneck. The more product it gets and the more product it gets. You must put lower until eventually you are stuck in a chair. So that's when you move. 
Diagrams are available for many types of geometry for this one from motion unit, election P or multi direction or population. They are debated for the tourist industry average content geometry. Okay, we have now covered how we generate data in lab studies. Now I may now zoom out again and motivate White Essential to use as many as precise or realistic models as possible to design blending or decision issues, because even in 2023 unnecessarily Cloud accurate but. 
You're regularly, colleagues. This paper is a must read and I value it from the deleted data. The publication also includes a comprehensive collection of data on these events and shows there and in which context. That's about activity. 
The summary even is display data collection with allow much more in depth analysis, quite simple, everywhere in the world to a touch events, but we've done it all as convincingly shown that the ground accident occur wherever there are high population densities, for instance in regions of the world where many people. 
This is of course philosophical, but again the background of the global Mega Trends such as agents and reorganization, this higher actual and it's a new Challenger for district purchase, architecture, Transportation, urban planning or event safety. I think we have a Content this year that we want to avoid events like this and I would like to. reflect together with you on what the rest in Dynamic research can contribute. 
Let's come back to the to the idea of the model idea of the compact system of a pedestrian in complex with deduction. We have two levels to consider. The first level is the mathematical realization of what was found out in the empirical experiment, and all of those findings were applied to application. You could pause it for the scaling. The technique level is a little bit below that. 
It is in the context of General concept Laboratory, that experiment or more, or in other words exemplary idea in which complete day to day situations are used and competitive, in the expectation that all those relevant and performed influencing variables are still included. In general. This is not the case. Experiment has to be producible and they must hardly contain unobserved heterogeneity, in other words variables. 
That you do not control in your design, but put you to unintentionally measure, for instance, if your movement is calculus by more features than you have selected, or whether we are making a good choice of competitive certification with our concept of study when we consider, for instance, a particular cohort of people in our experiment, for example, are we looking at a good example of the typical edge profile in our society, especially in case of ancient sausages? 
Here I present you, for example, the proportion of older people from the top and sausages over the last country and according to the projections built on dotted line that proportionately continue to rise over the next few years. But do you know what? If issues are typically realizing in the studies of digestive Dynamics, participants are also, for very pragmatic reasons, age between 20 and study they do not. 
Use any ad for one they have no physical, mental or age related impairment. Is it necessary to monitor strategic point of view? Yes, absolutely it is because you need to reduce competitive for controllability of a dollar industry foreign as aging research here from the left to the right. 
The proportion of those people in a total population will have some kind of visibility equities too, and as I have worked out, this is not only an already important part of population. It is also the part that's going through, and that's why we have to consider such populations in our study. I would now like to look with you at what characterizes the heterogeneous crowd. 
No, I should better say caring capitalize, because even what I know Define as a heterogeneous characteristic is only a model, but my understanding of a meaningful and dedication or decomposing of complex. setting. You see on the left hand side the footage of the bottom of the experiment. I have a YouTube experiment to explain the main characteristics of a history and sprout. 
In the next slide and on the right hand side you see the result of an application of the situation in a simulation. It doesn't depend at all on the model used and on the adjustment of the parameters. I understand that with written the re engineering you can also train the result to get dealt with the rhythm of the experiment. But I would like to show you a principle. We see a completely different picture. 
The result of the simulation of the on the right hand side produces chronic polycon blocking Cloud. The area in the front of the bottom that is clouded and equally use space can be observe the high identity at the bottleneck in. front and later agents will gather in a semester around the body like the Hedgehog. In contrast, we have served in the vehicle experiment on the left that the variable space unfortunate is not used at all. 
For instance here these are identities formed or the categorithmic semic circle around the entrance created upstreams. There are gaps, for instance here or here, and unused area. The participants do not move up and close this Gap. This can be observed especially in the neighborhood of which it uses. But what happens there? You can see now converted about the enzyme. But this is proud interact and Community. 
They organize the end Quantum Department far ahead of the Baltimore daily space. They adapt the speed and they do not overtake and even now operationalize these types of behavior and look at the frequency distributions you see without drawing much in detail a. very general trend. On the left we have a metric of our behavioral categories on the y axis and the approximated approximate, the patient's measurement area one, two, three, four where they occur. 
Location is not so important for today. They just give you an indication of where the knowledge of the communication, of the interaction takes place. Please Focus only on the color. Red means frequently yellow means less frequency. We see that the most common Behavior was for people to turn around or wait in a homogeneous clouds. But also it was also interesting to see at some time participants would like to just interesting. 
There are some changes in conditions. When wheelchairs you can reach the users were present on the right hand side. There was noticeably more waiting. But also my communications will be extra investors. You see the more red than yellow we interpreted that. 
The participants were more respectful and clauses and purpose conditions, and the key Point here is that the virginity throughout composition can be associated with differences in how people act, and this I think could have an impact on microscopic Trends such as speed factor relationship, and it's unclear with specific visible attitude and actions of personal matter and why we have seen that the crowd moves quantitatively differently, but also that the agent in the simulation have passed the bottleneck recognizably earlier. 
This can also be shown more clearly in this plot that each passes patterns of the bottleneck. I count people in the y direction and in the next Direction the time is presented. You can see how much part of the situations you're created in the simulation, the experiment. There are times when no participant harvest the bottleneck. For a very long time I have piloted anti. 
Stanic by the own scatter in the times corresponds to the time where we changed. You get the cubicle of the space was left after the Richer user and the followers do not give up but keep the distance and this leads to longer evacuation time on top longer leave time. Do you remember the fundamental diagram I have introduced? I did it at the beginning. 
If you have less space, you will reduce your speed, for example on the way to the restaurant parade in the Southern Table. I will show you a touch of fundament diagram for the experiment before, because this interaction actions has to have severe impact on the fundamental character average values that then to be dependent speed for the experiment. The color the scatter represented and with watercolor and the meaning of the markers are not important for us. 
Today we see a degreasing. average release of velocity with ingredient density, but obviously the entity has a much smaller effect under velocity of people and disease to a better slope in the curve than expected in the right foot you see the fundamental diagram generated simulation. It's called technical expectation, because we have not considered social interaction in the model. 
The modern simulation follows the classical pattern because it is based and that's a good fundamental diagram, because the agents don't know anything about the politeness or the feeling of the government inside the group and they don't reduce individual speed in case of approaching the bottleneck as a neighbor for which a user. So the question is: how does the perception of the vulnerability arrives? 
Why photosystem don't overtake a and why do you, for instance, if priority to a visual part of the bottleneck they would use to interpret vulnerability we showed? them many avatars and ask them to always click on the alternative that they consider to be more vulnerable. Not very surprisingly we found out that perception of vulnerability scale with the space by the item. 
The larger the item is greater the ability, for instance, have more backpack, as the thief left one of the Venezuela, and there seems to be a job interception in the two suitcase. So we wanted to see how big the effect was in a very important setting. He wanted to find out how movement and a single file changes when either visuals are present or not. That's why we again marked in a field I collects from. 
The Jewish Research Center conducted another study in Canada, as you can see. We conducted our study in the gym at the local University. We collected data on frequent contributive days and had prepared several different. scenarios. The images showed us there from the video we used to create track for it. 
To come on this later, participants are frame from above walking in a line to accept it right to reduce their local matter, they should not follow us the location and the duration of the movement. 
Your primary interest in the Headway, which is the distance that the assistant had from each other, from the head, to be had along the bottom of the slide you can see the sketch of the study design and the direction of movement is, however clockwise from the left to the right. I have higher five people in color. First in green. The leading participant came from the daddy team and shoot this painting frequency. 
According to a predetermined we call him a pacemaker, and the pacemaker was wearing headphones and was listening to a metronome that would. provide them with design space. The clock frequency has been determined at Bond so that we could approximate the Target Field to map a wider range to have a speed relation the table on the right side of the difference frequency of the associated Target movement feed as well as the realized movement and as you can see, this book was very satisfactorily for chartered for those greater than 0,5 meters per second, but below that we could not will either set the speed was Intimates from now second until you see the predecessor of a Witcher user. 
The Witcher user we use two type a picture with slightly different dimensions. Due to the covet pandemic, the issues we have, we are not able to reach Refuge users who use their research in their life. That's why we, the Richer users, individuals, are used by people without impairment from. our study team. They were had experience in these individuals. They were brain and possible, were unaware that the team members had no actual disability. 
Cool kind of orange should see the participant to walk of. The Witcher and last, in blue all the other participants. We measured the Headway of each participant. Then what is one approximate measurement line of 10 centimeters? Well, let's take a look at how we expected the data. Once again I will present you a video. First you can see our pacemaker setting the paste order for the signal for experiment. 
Next, you can see individuals are moving on the line. You can see. The Witcher user is an oral predecessor and last his or her follow ups. These are the followers. Yes or let's stop? So we use a software called pitrack from a research center to detect certain pixel head up in. the footage, even the Rooker code on their head, this one. We are able to calculate the center of a participating pad for each frame. 
And here's a center, and I would now like to show you the center point for 15 seconds in the path in the future, or a little bit more a little illustrator combined by a line and given the center of the head, the body height of each individual, knowing the position, the height and some technical specification of the camera, we can now calculate on the projected center of a participant mask on the ground, and now we can find Cut next line through factories and finalize. 
We can plot them and to analyze them. But first I would like to present you the result of the unemputed movement speed. The unimped speed was measured for each participant at the beginning of each test. day. It's a good reference point for the daily performance and first it is striking out that we have collected more data points for participants with our features. This is possible because fewer people participated in visuals and religion. 
We also see a high variant and very used for both groups. We ranges from about 0,8 to slightly more than 0,6.1,6 meters per second and overall in the expected range of the literature. This is good to decide. 
The two Unity users were moving a little bit faster on average, but all in all the same region as the other participants, and the main take home method here is that the median speed and that movement is around 525 meters per second for the overall population, 0,26, for which the users and open 21 a 1,21, so the movement is in the flat movement. speed and flat movement is it's the same. 
The second result is the fundamental diagram we've got here the speed over the Headway for each participant on each trial and there are some other advances stands out here. We have all data across all conditions. We call it the burger, because we see a very nicely the different speed layers and these things and never speed layout indicated the pacemaker was successful and manipulating the speed of participants. 
However, we see a strong evaluation of the Headway and this seems to be relatively independent from the speed and this kind of difference differentiate our study from previous the homogeneous group, for example. I have reported data from pH at all with the black crosses and which shows distinct phases in the street head relationship, the strong correlation at low speed and headways and the better curve one speed reaches your. 
0,18 meters per second, and this is interesting, but I think the difference likely to do pacemakers hydrogen speed was also interesting is that the marginalization comes on the wine. It appears that speed doesn't always follow a normal distribution, and this is an important detail, because we often use particular measures as input variable for application and these measures are not immediately available from multi model distribution. 
To make these measures available, distribution must be further percent, for instance final one. So just this might be an important feature for characterizing heterogeneous groups. And now I'd like to focus on the situation in a crew. 
I show you a footage of experiments of drought movements, robots and in the same study to study in Canada that much in advance Research Center, each group consists of 25 people, two of whom are either a richer user working with two. suitcase or Nothing at All. The task is to go to the bottleneck after the start. 
If you look again at how the crew organizes the movements the bottleneck well after start after the start, all participants move towards the bottleneck. The videos are time synchronized and you will notice right away. But if you get the time to the last package will be fair for the precondition: homogeneous ground. The distance is Luggage in the ground or each other in the cloud. 
I will stop the video now and the last participant in the ocean start pass the public and you can see qualitatively the different numbers of participants inside an external area and in the next slide. I would also like to dive a little bit deeper into this quality of finding, but first I want to explain the setting you see here at directory report that is. 
The combination of each position at each time step for each participation for all. For the following analysis, I would like to distinguish the participants in terms of their starting position and for two particular positions in certain characteristics. Let's do this step by step. First the participants starting in the first row. Then participants on defined starting position. They either use a bit user video carry luggage or are from the control purpose out luggage. 
Then participants starting in the second floor who don't start at a specific position. Those participants don't have the language with them or which or, and they don't they aren't future users and LA on the last row. We measure the patterns, the bottleneck at the Blue Line. This is here and the end of the bottleneck and the first analysis focuses the time it takes to reach the bottleneck that is the. 
Time left between the start of the experiment and the time of reaching the bottleneck page processes. The second analysis concerns the time it takes each participant to pass through the bottleneck, more precisely the time that they last between the passage of an individual and its follower. Let us start with the comparison for the time to reach the bottom. It is once again sketched on the right hand side of the plot in the Top Line. 
The data is built by the different starting positions, as I mentioned before the first row, the specific position for future for luggage user, the other participant participants in the second role and the lab at the last row. This is, as a reminder, displayed at the right of the plot. The colors of the scatter gray, blue and deep orange are according to the study condition after that in which a. 
User's luggage users or the control group at the specific starting position. So let's have a look at the comparison of the plot. The first row is the path of the last one is lowest because the time to reached the bottleneck depends on the distance of the cutting for the dead. Trivial times to reach are very similar between the groups for the first floor. 
That's possible because it is because in the first one it's set by comparative population. The first row is always populated by the participants without luggage or wheelchair. But we can observe differences between the conditions and the specific start positions and the large roles. The participants in the control experiment feeding the bottleneck in a shorter time then if the lightest or which you expected it seems that this affects the participants in the large roles. 
It deals with all the largest individuals. are not overtaken by the participants on the last row. Okay, focusing on the time to pass the button, the times that passes between the patterns of two participants. Here we mean time that elapsed after passage into another passage, the troops. A specific distinction here began as for our control which our luggage user or the start position and otherwise the roads to start position. 
Again it will display it on the right hand side. The bottom line and the colors of the scatter are according to the study condition with which users, luggage users control. But it's been focusing the time at the passage time. We observe minor differentials in the first, second and the last one. Similar people. Stimulus, okay, but we draw totally different pictures for the participants in the specific position. 
The starting position is better control, we would say, or language, but it's been. located if a participant is dealing with two suitcases, the time to pass the bottleneck for the follower double if the feature user passes the button at the time under the presence of the follow for increases by the in the median by three times the dynamic space requirement and the perception of the follow up. Okay, I've been out. So a short conclusion. 
I have given you a quick overview of the influence of heterogeneous characteristic in pedestrian Dynamic it. People with different externally perceivable characteristics are considered in a crowd. The overall system gets more interactive, it becomes more Compact and the regular and the singular dependence of the variable decrease. 
Of course a principal relational speed and distance in the single file fundamental diagram remain, but the variance increases and is especially for future use of independent density also distribution of the speed 10 certain speed ranges. to non linear characteristics when moving to a bottleneck. We observe an impact of people with luggage and richer users on the overall account performance. 
This observation is verified by two independently under studies, at least for the rich users and when people walk behind a person with luggage or in a region, it takes more time to reach the body wheelchair. The question that sums it all up: do we need new methods to model and describe the movement of heterogeneous groups of people? I don't necessarily think so. It's not crucial to develop new methods. 
There are so many great experiments and important Finance, but it is important to be careful about scaling these results too easily to other populations. For example, if you look at the fundamental diagram and I don't have to show our fundament diagram we see a large area of density, independent velocities in. the assessment of which survival without the conditions then changes. 
The model of the fundamental diagram just assumes that the velocity or flow depends only on the density and in the population b or up, this boundary condition is no longer valid. This may complicated and fair, but it does not make the statistical homogeneous groups that's used for or less valuable. 
But to contrary this, homogeneous conditions you can create, for example, more reproducibility and more control that you cannot be achieved that cannot be achieved for petrogenous groups. But at the end I would like to point out the methodological issue. When considering the headwear, for instance, as well as the when we triangulating the wrong noise itself, we always assume that the space shared between two individuals is always divided and used in degree proposal. 
We triangulate, for instance, from the center of the head to the. other head, but in reality, however, a richer user makes a makes a much larger claim on this shared phase. So we on increasingly underestimate the density of the wheelchair user with the current approach and just make the comparison, for instance, for the fundamental diagram. It's very difficult, challenging. Before I come to the end, I would like to give you an output. 
I think it's a little bit more extended Outlook. Do you remember that my hypothesis at the beginning wanted every single model? Now that I've showed you a result from the control studies, I want to also illustrate the point for its official gng. In a less controlled setting, fire Drillers are commonly model to simulate emergency evacuation, and the good question is how chronology strangely influences illustration performance and how it will differ from Lab studies. 
I would like to give you now a very. brief insight into the general design of two unannounced illegations. First three was real life was realized in a residential home for disabled people and the second show that was performed in an. I think it's a general thing in a blog post. There are people with disability in blood. I don't know if there's something like this out of Germany. 
This is the state supported workplace where mostly people with disabilities the world, and even so we've learned the truth of camera. I'm not allowed to show you the pictures. That was the condition for the Ethics Committee for acceptance. Depending with our concept, the boundary conditions of Interest are chosen very differently.
