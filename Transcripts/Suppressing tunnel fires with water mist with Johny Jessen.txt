 Hello and welcome to Fire Science Show Session 31. As usual, great to have you here with me. As you may recall, some time ago I visited a very interesting conference on water mists and I've met quite a lot of interesting people in there. And I've been reaching to some of them because they caught my attention. The interesting thing about this water mist group of people is that they test everything with huge fires. And as you can imagine, I like large fire experiments. That's what I like most in fire science. And I'm really interested in a group of people who are literally burning down warehouses to test the efficiency of their fixed extinguishing systems. So I've also noticed that some of these systems are being used in tunnels. And I'm a very active designer of tunnel fire safety, being involved in many tunnel projects in Poland. So that one was really, really interesting to me because some people in my country were asking me about my opinions about these systems. So I figured out, yeah, what's the best way to learn something new about bottomless systems than inviting an expert into the podcast and just ask them. And that's just what I did. I found a really nice expert with great experience in burning tunnels and extinguishing them with water mist, Mr. Johnny Jensen from VAD Fire Kill Company from Denmark. Johnny has done enormous, enormous fire tests in Spain to prove that his solution for water mist is fit for purpose for a certain project in Singapore. And he's going to tell me all about it, but we're also going to touch differences between sprinkler systems, or how he calls them, deluge systems, and medium pressure or low pressure or high pressure water mists. But this is not only about extinguishing fires in tunnels or suppressing fires in tunnels. It's also quite an interesting talk about how large projects are awarded, what you have to go through to get such a huge project, what amount of engineering goes into that. We also touched a lot of practical stuff related to water mist, which for me was the most interesting, I guess, because that's the knowledge I wanted to get from this episode. So I hope you're still with me and I hope you're interested in this topic. I promise it's good. It's worth your time. And even though it may be a little less fire science-ish than usual, it's still a great lesson on how fire safety systems in buildings and in tunnels work, which in my opinion is highly valuable. So without further ado, please welcome Johnny Jessen from VAD and let's jump into the episode. Johnny Jessen from VAD and let's jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello, welcome to FireSense show. I'm today with Johnny Jessen from VAD Firekill. Hey, Johnny. Hello. That's amazing to actually have an in-person interview for once after dozens of remote ones. So happy to have you in Poland. What brings you here? Business? of remote ones. So happy to have you in Poland. What brings you here? Business? Business, yeah. So I'm working with infrastructure projects. We are looking into a few projects here in Poland. That's fantastic. I know there's so much happening around in here, especially in the tunnel area. And it's something I actually wanted to talk with you today. Myself, I'm an engineer who works a lot with road tunnels, and I've stumbled upon information that you've done some really huge fire experiments in tunnels with your WaterMist technology. That is right, yeah. So in 2018, in combination with winning a big project in Singapore, big project in Singapore. One of the requirements in the tenter was that we had to verify performance criteria as set by the client. Some weeks ago, I have been in the Watermist conference by IWMA, and I've learned that Watermist people test everything by the trial of fire. So somehow, I am not surprised by the fact that you've burned the tunnel to check if this technology is working. That has been the most fascinating aspect from connecting with the world of water mist for myself. Before we start talking about tunnels, I would like to talk a bit about the technology because I'm not sure if everyone in the audience is on the same page with us. And I'm not sure if I'm on the same page. For me, some time ago, it was usually thinking about just water-based extinguishing systems. I was not really that looking into the differences between them. But then I've obviously learned there's water mist, there's sprinklers. And then I've learned that water mist has flavors like low pressure, high pressure. So if you could briefly explain how does that differentiate between the solutions? What are the differences? So I think to make it most simple, so accordingly to NFPA 750, so the definition between a sprinkler or dilute system and the definition when it's becoming a water mist system, that's very simple. Because if you are distributing DV90, meaning in your spray pattern, meaning that your droplet is above one millimeter or a thousand micron, then, by definition, a dilute system or a sprinkler system. Okay. If it's below, it's a water-mess system. And then it's correctly, as you said, there is high pressure, there is intermediate pressure, and there is low pressure. And they, of course, have different droplet distribution. However, part of the, should we say, the droplet distribution is in a lot of varieties of droplet, where high pressure is very, very efficient. If you have a closed compartment, a machinery room, where you really have high temperatures and where your small droplets get entertained, they will not be drafted away by ventilation or natural wind. Then they immediately have an effect on the cool of the fire. Where on the opposite, if you are in a energy application, then of course the smaller droplets will be carried away either by natural wind or by the ventilation system. So then meaning that the smaller droplet will not come into action with a fire where you have a low pressure, which is, should we say, a hybrid between what I would call a tent to be a deluge system, but at the same time also have the good droplet distribution. The smaller droplets like a high pressure system as well. So it could be possible to simplify it into a discussion that the bigger the droplet, the easier it has to penetrate through hot air or so. Correct, yeah. And it can easier reach the fire, but the worse its capability to evaporate and take heat away, right? Yeah, so that's to say total fundamental way of mitigating a fire. That is that a deluge system is bedding. Yeah. Yeah, so that's the main, although it also, a portion of the droplet will also evaporate and cool. Where vice versa, if you talk about a water mist system, then the most important and critical is the smaller correct droplet variation, which will evaporate and cool it. And a minor part will then act as a bedding medium as you said penetrate bionce effect or the the fire flume as well also yeah and i've also always loved the differences between like sprinkler system or automatic sprinklers and and the deluge systems and this is something that hollywood cannot wrap their mind around because you always in the movies, it's always like someone breaks a sprinkler and then everything on the floor operates. There was for me, my favorite scene was from Blade movie where he turned the water in the tank into holy water and then sprinkled vampires. And that was absolutely hilarious when he did that. So in your case, in tunnels, we would pretty much always be talking about systems that have to have a fire detection, open nozzles, and you just literally flood a section of a tunnel. Otherwise, it makes no sense. So no bulbs, no automatic operation. It would not work, no. That would not work. I've learned that already, yes. Okay, cool. I think this introduction is helpful to understand the differences in technologies. However, still, the technologies seem to be very similar. Like the main action would be the cooling and the direct action on the fuel. I think even if you have sprinkler systems, which technically would penetrate the buoyant plume, I mean, we're talking about vehicles. And I just had Anja Hoffman in the podcast who's researching fires and vehicles. And she told me that it's quite difficult to extinguish buses because they're waterproof. So it's like they're meant to not be penetrated by the water. So in essence, it's the external action against the fire and products of the fire, which is the important one. Okay, so let's go into the world of tunnels. You said you have one project overseas, and one of the requirements was that you demonstrate your system's capability to be fit for the purpose. Can you tell us? First, I'm really interested in how does one define an experiment to be a requirement for a commercial project? Because in Europe, I don't think I've ever been in such a situation that someone would. And I'm not talking about standard tests, which we do at ITB all the time, all day long. But like experimental work to show that solution is fit for design purposes. That is not totally correct because there have been, you know, what I missed, you say, is not a technology which is 50 or 100 years old. So it's what we call in our terms a relative new technology. So in the start, so talking about the 80s and 90s, so there was no, should we say, base material or test performed and so on. So some of the UK projects, some of the big projects made in Spain and France actually also was based on tender requirements where they had to perform, should we say, a full-scale test also. But that's like for water-based technology. And how were the requirements defined for this particular project? So I'm not into a deal, but what I can explain is about the big experiment, the last experiment that we did in 2018. So this is, of course, we are typically not involved in the protocols, the basic criteria for living up to what the client wants. So that is totally up to the authorities having jurisdiction and, you say, local stakeholders. And in this case, it was in Singapore, it was civil defense. It was very much involved in that. And how did they then create the protocol? So they, of course, hired a certified fire lab lab to gather them to create the protocol. But by protocol you mean a certain experiment to be carried to... Yes, and what is the criterion and... Yeah, actually, yeah. So, in our case, so Efectis was hired by the tunnel owner, which in that case was LTA, which is typically the same as you would have police highways or something like that, the road authorities. Of course, you will try also to find some global or international requirements which can be used to put into the specification of the fire test. And in this case, it was important for them was, besides, you say, the engineering part was the tenability requirements. And for that particular case, they was referring to NFPA 502, which have the tunnel and the bridge specification regarding tenability. So there is certain tenability requirements regarding upstream, downstream temperatures, and so on and so on. However, for the setup of the fire load, the fuel setup and so on, it's nothing that you will find in NFPA 502. So that is typically either totally developed by the fire lab in combination with the authorities, local authorities, or referring to one of the most common used guidance, which could be solid or it could be up to, which helps you say, special part for setting up fire tests and protocols for full-scale tunnel fire tests. So you had certain criteria defined for turnability, which were related to visibility, temperature, heat fluxes and so on. Yes, correct. Which were the target to obtain. And then to demonstrate the capacity of this technology, you had to compare it with an extinguished fire, right? Yeah. Typically to do what we call free fire is very, very difficult to be allowed to do in a test tunnel. Yeah. But anyhow, I think for the first and last time we were allowed to do it, because I will tell you what happened with that. Yeah. But I think maybe we should first go through the actual test that we did, and then I will go back to the free fire, because that's some interesting aspects in that. Okay. So start with your test. So first of all, you've mentioned, when we discussed this, you've mentioned that a deluge system would be commonly applied for such a tunnel in this region. In this region, yeah. So can you first tell me how it happened that you proposed the MIST in place of that? And then tell me about the MIST test. So, of course, as I was mentioning, referring back to the 80s to the 90s, a lot of experiments were done with water mist, also in tunnel applications. So if you go a little bit more back in the histories, countries like Japan, like Australia, and a few other, also the States, United States, actually, Australia, and a few other, also the States, United States, actually, for the last 50 to 75 years, actually, have implemented the LOO system into their tunnel systems. So for them, it's not a new technology. So you can say that in those parts, they were leaning to what was done in Australia and Japan. So that also was implemented to Vietnam, to Singapore and other countries, of course. So there was no, should we say, in brackets, need to look for new technology. But of course, when you get the new technology, you just have efficient engineering part maybe and less water consumption, power consumption and so on. And then, of course, this also gets interesting. course, this also gets interesting. In this particular case, with reference to this project in Singapore, WaterMist was interested for the client because it was a refurbishment of existing tunnels. So actually two different tunnel systems, totally 14 kilometers times two tubes. So yeah, in average, it was roughly 30 kilometers of tunnels which had to be refurbished. So in the past, it was not installed with any kind of active fire suppression system. But as we all know, if you have an existing tunnel system, you also have a drainage capacity. And for that, it was a very large problem for the client that if they want to introduce a dilute system into the existing tunnels, then the drainage capacity could simply not take the water consumption by the dilute system. So that's why, to be honest, probably water mist also for them was interesting. The other aspect is, of course, that they didn't want a system or technology which was not as efficient as a deluge system. And that's why I think coming back to why was there in the specification, in the tender specification, the demand for doing full-scale tests and also actually comparison tests with deluge system and mixed system to see if the efficiency was the same as for a dilute system. I think that was the basis of why we got into that project. If you compare the dilute systems and water mist systems, usually discussing their economical benefits, it usually comes down to water consumption because you need less water? Yeah, we have to define, I'm talking about a high pressure, a low pressure, or dilute. Because there is three different levels. Yeah, it is. So as I mentioned in the introduction or into the start, that a low pressure water-mix system is more kind of a hybrid with a dilute system. So we have, for instance, the pressure level is in P and 16, everything is P and 16, I mean, maximum 16 bar. Okay. So that means we are on the same pressure level as a sprinkler or a deluge system. So that means that pipes, pumps are very much similar to what you will find in a deluge system. Okay. And for high pressure, you would need... Then you have high pressure. But then also much less water, right? So also power, again, the power consumption from a low pressure is very similar to what you would experience with a dilute system. However, if you have a power from a high pressure system, it will minimum be double or triple the power consumption from a dilute or a low pressure system. Yeah. Talking about the water consumption. So a dilute system, so if we take high pressure, low pressure is similar density. So all from 2.5 millimeter per minute to 4.5 millimeter per minute, all depending on the application. So there's also like two and a half or four 4.5 liters per minute per square meter, right? Yeah, correct. If you compare that with the deluge system, and now, as you say, referring to in the region where this system or this application was, so there is typically the deluge system, which is between 10 mm per minute to 12 mm per minute. which is between 10 mm per minute to 12 mm per minute. And that also was the two different systems that we were bound to test as well also, or Effectis was bound to test in the preparation. I ask that because whenever I have a discussion with a client regarding the installment of fixed extinguishing systems in the tunnels, and I think out of 20 tunnels we've been involved in Poland, And I think out of 20 tunnels we've been involved in Poland, the fixed were considered or put in the tender for, I think, three of them. And, you know, the discussion rarely goes into kinetic energy of droplets or the capability of them to penetrate flames or stuff like that. It usually goes, OK, but how much water? How big the tank? What's the power of the pumps that we need? Can we remove the water from there? Will it be contaminated? How do we clean it? These are the things that the clients are mostly considering. Because in the end, I guess they assume that the capability of the system to fight fire is similar and is just provided by the technology. So we rarely go into discussions of whether one system is capable of extinguishing or not, but rather into the functional aspects of what it means to have these systems on the tunnel. So also again, coming back to the three most common technologies installed in tunnels, so low pressure, high pressure, or the loose. Also, again, the concern is, of course, you would say contamination and other phases blocked by dirt and so on. And also, again, the difference is that, as you know, the way that high pressure is distributing the droplets is by pressure, mainly by the high pressure, which is then distributed those variety of droplet sizes. Whereas a low pressure system, it's again a little bit, as I mentioned, a hybrid with the deluge system, accelerating the water before it went out of our, what should we say, orifice. And the orifices that we use in our, should we say, tunnel nozzles is between, depending what location and system or model that we use in our, shall we say, tunnel nozzles, is between, depending on what location and system or model that we are, between 2.5 to 4 millimeters. And there you have to bear in mind the high-pressure system is between 0.2 to 0.4 millimeter. So, of course, it's a much more vulnerable contamination from the outside, but for sure from the inside. So the maintenance would be a factor as well. I'm surprised actually maintenance is not that often being brought up by the people who will buy and use the tunnel for the next 50 years. Actually, they probably should ask that as the first question. They should actually, yeah. Also, sometimes in Poland we had foam systems designed and we even had CFS, compressed foam system designed for one tunnel. So there's a large group of active systems that feel more or less the same purpose but with completely different ways. Okay, so your client was interested in refurbishing a tunnel, existing tunnel, for which they seemed more, let's say, cost-effective or a different solution, as in WaterMist, would be sufficient. I don't want to say better than the Looch system, because all the systems fit different needs, right? Exactly, yeah. But they found that WaterMist is potentially a viable technology. They've asked you to provide the proof in terms of experiment. So, okay, how does one go from, okay, yeah, boss, we got it. We got the project. We just need to burn a tunnel. How do you communicate that to your leadership and how do you perform that? No, so, I mean, it was not a surprise for the leadership because, as I told you, that in the tender requirements, when we made our offer, then it was clear to us and we had to price. So it was not a big shock for my boss. Let me rephrase that. Okay, boss, we can apply for this tender, but we need to first find a tunnel to burn down. So it was more like this decision. So how does one approach that? So then, of course, you... So actually, we're talking about Europe. So the two most common used test tunnels in Europe, that is the Osnestal in Norway, which is an abandoned road tunnel. And then there is the tunnel in the San Pedro de Llanes, which is in Asturias in Spain, which is an abandoned railway tunnel, which then is refurbished to be a road tunnel. So, yeah, 600 meter long tunnel. So, of course, you go into communication with the guys in Spain, and then could we borrow? Actually, it costs something, of course. I can imagine. Do you have some available time in spring 2018, for instance? And then they will answer, how much time do you need? Yes, we need to do 16 tests. So that was the estimation, actually, that we had to perform 16 tests to go through all the parameters that the client wanted to have verified. 16? 16, yeah. Okay. And can you briefly tell us the scope of the tests from the report I've received from VAD? I saw there was a pre-burn test, there was two water mist tests, right? Can you tell us more in details about that? So there was a lot of combination tests, which we cannot go into today because that will be too complex. But as you said, you realized that water mist, they do a lot of actual tests, practical tests with the loose or sprinkler system. Practical tests with the loose or sprinkler system, they have the base behind them, so they can typically in a lot of projects and also accordingly to the regulation go directly. So they are allowed in many cases to do it without doing actual tests. So first of all, you could say that we had to calibrate for this test tunnel in relation to what we want to achieve. Actually, pre-test is the complex thing and is the thing which takes most, the majority of the time when you are into a test tunnel. And the actual final test, when you press the button and you invite the client to come and see the actual test and performance, that's the smallest part. Let me put it this way. Okay. So the pre-test is when you calibrate the fuel source and performance, that's the smallest part. Let me put it this way. So the previous is when you calibrate the fuel source and stuff like that? Not so much the fuel source because that was a given. Ah, that was for the fire, okay. But there was a lot of other calibration and also instrumentation which had to be calibrated and so on. And what was the fuel source? Coming back to those existing tunnels in Singapore. And what was the fuel source? That means a lot of the goods which have to be transported from one end to the other end of the city had to go a very, very long deviation to get to the point. So why they want to install or implement fixed firefighting systems was to allow heavy goods vehicles with potentially more dangerous loads to go through. And also they have had some not very nice fire accidents in those tunnels also during the year. So it was two things that they want to knock by doing this. some not very nice fire accidents in those tunnels also during the year. So it was two things that they want to knock by doing this. So then, of course, the next question is that how big loads are the client or did the client expect to go through the tunnels? And, of course, there you can go into research, say, what you will find done in the past of what is the typical fire load of a heavy goods vehicle, depending on the load and so on. But anyway, the client said, we want to go for very high fuel loads because we want also to build for the future, meaning that the potential bigger fire loads can go through those tunnels. Yeah. In the technical documentation, I see it was a lot of stacks of wood and then plastic pallets. You can say, why are you using plastics and why are you using pallets actually as the fuel? So when you are doing those kind of tests, and you also have to be compared with competitors, so to speak. compared with competitors, so to speak. So whatever you see our competition doing a similar type of test, you will see the same fuel. So that is a generally acceptable fuel mix because it's reputable. That means that Euro Pallet, whatever it's bought in Poland or is bought in Denmark or moved to Singapore or whatever, it's having the same dimensions, the same wood. Mass and stuff like that. Yeah, exactly, yeah. And it's also identified what is the fire capacity within one pellet. So it's very easy to build up different fire loads with those. I understand the choice because we usually start working with woodgrips as well in buildings. So I can tell you that if you go 15, 20 years ago, there was a lot of experiments done with actual vehicles. Yes. And also with the heavy goods vehicles. But the problem by that is that you cannot replicate it. So that if it's a Japanese car, it's a European car, you have the content of plastic and other. And they're also not representative for years because you would probably purchase an older vehicle, not necessarily a fresh, new from the dealership and stuff like that. That's also the thing I've discussed with Anja Wollinghaus, often three episodes ago, where she was testing buses, and all these things were very important, the age of the vehicle and what the material contents of the vehicle inside is however here we are i think the biggest challenge is with the cargo not the vehicle itself like if you burn an empty truck in the tunnel it should not be that horrible and when it's filled with cargo it's completely different and i also saw that you've covered the front and back back with metal sheets, the sides with some kind of a cloth that probably burnt out. So if you look at some of the experiments which were done in the early 2000 and 2010 or 12, then you will see a lot of those experiments were done with what you call open fire loads. That means there was not, to say, covered with tarpaulin or with a metal sheet. And that means that, of course, it's much more easier to suppress an open fire. And that's why today you'll see in all new full-scale tests, whatever is performed by Deluxe or by different water mist windows, you will see always it will be trying to simulate a real situation and a real heavy goods vehicle from your perspective is obvious that you need the top covered because you don't want to have artificial cooling of the fuel inside by respect water on top of it but i i also remember a talk i think it was professor ingerson in austria and Graz at some point, who said that the ventilation conditions of the fuel have immense effects on the size of the fire. And you could burn two vehicles of that, one to 50 megawatts, one to a few hundred megawatts just by altering how it's shielded and covered. And I also had this episode of the show with Sarah McAllister who's burning cribs passionately, and she's burned hundreds, if not thousands of wood cribs, and investigates the differences of how the porosity affects the burning inside. So definitely, the fuel is very complex itself. But, okay, let's assume this is standardized. So now, to the results, what was the main difference, obviously, that the extinguishing must have had? First of all, just to say a few brief words about the protocol. Okay, yeah, let's go. Typically, when you have a fire in a tunnel, you will try to activate your system as soon as possible to attack the fire in its initial stage. But again, typically, if you refer back more or less all experiments done with whatever it's, dilute or water mist systems, you will see a delayed activation. And the typically period before you will activate your system is either when the temperature reaches 60 degrees or it will just with a certain time limit. In our case, so when 60 degrees was reached, then the fire was detected. And from that point, fire detected. Then in the protocol, we had to wait minimum five minutes before we were allowed to activate the system, which will typically not be the actual case because if you have identified fire either by your detection system or your CCTV system, of course, you will activate your system to attack the fire in its initial state. But here, we let it grow. So actually, you can say all those vendors which actually performed a full-scale testing building should say kind of a safe, extra additional safety factor. And of course, you also in some of the fire strategies in the tunnel, you will also see that the authorities want to say a kind of a delay also from a fire detected until the system is activated, allowing people to evacuate out of the tunnel. So that could be a time frame of two to three minutes. It was also carried in a ventilation condition. So was the ventilation triggered immediately or also delayed together with your system? So in this particular case and in Singapore, local regulation that all the time, whatever you have a fire, not a fire, all the 24-7, they run with a five meters per second ventilation. Ah, okay. So it's like the initial condition for everything. Yeah. So that means during the whole phase, we had 5 meters per meter running all the time. So you let the fire grow for, let's say, 7, 8 minutes, I assume? Yeah, no, you detect the fire. Yeah, yeah. So that's the fire,, so that's the starting point, so to speak. You can say, yeah, from that 5 minutes before you are allowed to activate. And what happens upon activation? Is the effect like immediate? Does it take you some time? How does it look at the moment you start the system? So, especially within ventilation and smoke, a lot of smoke. The system. But, of course, whatever is a dilute system or a water mist system, until you have penetration, you say, through the tarpaulin sites of these heavy goods vehicles, until that, you only cool the environment. So, until you have direct access into the fire site, yeah, then, but you will see a lot of steam. You will see a lot of smoke there, yeah. I'm asking because from the plots I see the spike in radiation and rapid change in the heat flux. And it's also something which is my own feeling when i play with with any extinguishing systems that if you are actually near a source of fire and i assume in your laboratory when you do protocols you feel that as well the moment uh this device is activated it's like someone turned off radiation it's like and it's gone it's amazing how extremely well water is in shielding from radiation. And I assume that is the biggest effect that it can have on the life safety ahead of the fire. So I assume the moment that the water released and the courses of two tests have completely disjoined. So in the free burn test, which I see, the peak heat release rate reached 233 megawatts. That is a lot of heat release. Yeah. The most frightening here, I think, is the speed within it. Yeah. So that is always what I'm referring to when I'm in discussion with consultants or tunnel owners. As we all know, 95% of all tunnels, whatever is in Europe or globally, is depending on a ventilation system to do the job, so to speak. But here you can see that the ventilation system, the only thing that it actually performed was up to the tenability requirement, meaning the upstream tenability was done, but all the other parameters, and then coming back to why it will ever, never be allowed more to do a free burn in a test tunnel. So actually we destroyed 150 meters of the tunnel there. Oh, how unfortunate. Very unfortunately. So they told us very specifically if ever again we should come there. Not actually to us directly because it was Effectis who on our behalf was hiring the on the client's behalf. I was hiring the John that it will ever, never be allowed anymore to do a free burn. So probably we will be the last tunnel window who will be allowed to do a free burn. I mean, now your test can be used as reference. Yeah, I assume you would be kind enough if someone wanted in the future. I think, Wojciech, very much coming back to what you say, that the ventilation velocity have a lot of effect on the fire growth. Because my thesis there is that if it was been running with the critical velocity, then you will not have that gross potential. So it will have been delayed much, much more. Also for the test situations where our system was, if it was not performed with five meters per second, but with two or two and a half meter, depending on what was the calculated critical velocity, you will see a much more critical or dramatic fire growth rate as you see on those experiments? I think it was the clearest it's shown was when experiments carried in Ghent for the Flanders government. It was experiments run by Xavier Dekkers and the University of Ghent. What they've done, they've built a tunnel from marine containers and they were burning vehicles inside these containers. A lot, I think. It was in double digits. I don't recall the final number of how many cars they've burned, but it was a lot. And they were playing with ventilation and different extinguishing systems. And they found that when it was ventilation alone, it had a huge effect on the size of the fire. When it was the extinguishing system alone, it had this effect of penetrating the vehicle and actually affecting the size of the fire, which was in a way surprising because we're talking about closed cars. And they also found that when it was a combination of ventilation and suppression, this effect was not really observed. That when the forced ventilation was there, it still has grown to quite a considerable size. The extinguishing system did its part, it did lower the temperatures and everything, you they observed the size of the fire was still growing because the fact you have pushed the air inside maybe i should invite him for an episode because i found that the research so there's just just one comment to that and i think that is generally not observed in results and also the aftermath of the result is that when you do your heat release rate in those experiments, it's typically the chemical heat release that you are measuring. So that means it's consumption of oxygen. But this is what I would call telling something about the fire machine. I mean, in the center of the fire. It's not actually telling anything outside the center of the fire. not actually telling anything outside the center of the fire. So for me, and I think also for tunnel owners and stakeholders, it should be more interesting to look at the convective heat. And also if you look at the report that I did there, if you look at the temperatures outside what I would call the fire machine, so to speak, then you will see they are relatively low. I think in this case, a 59 megawatt fire temperature. Yeah, so the chemical release was around 50 megawatts in your water spray test. If you look just outside the center of the fire, you will see quite low temperatures. Which makes sense because you're very effectively, even though the heat is released to the... It's not, should we say, reflecting the jet fans or ventilation system which is installed in tunnels. They don't take that aspect fully into consideration. Okay, now I have to ask you two questions related to myths about water, mist, and tunnels that I am often facing when I'm discussing the technologies with stakeholders. One is the combination of water mist and the ventilation, that the water mist will be carried away from the fire by the ventilation itself. And you had a very strong ventilation in here because five meters per second is way above the critical velocities which we would calculate usually. So what's your take? Did you observe any negative interference between ventilation and water mist in your case? So from my perspective, obviously, it's a little bit overrated, these deviation aspects. You will see, I mean, if you physically look at the spray impact, the ventilation on this, you will have a deviation. Yeah? Yeah. But it's minor. Probably for a low-pressure dilute system, it's definitely a minor deviation. But why I think it's more or less relevant is that typically here in Europe, when you do fire suppression systems in tunnels, you're always building that on a three-zone strategy, meaning that you have your middle zone where you have your fire, but you activate upstream and you activate downstream. So you make sure that the fire is more or less in the middle of the... So that means that even if you have some effect by high velocities from the ventilation system, but that also means that you will move your fire in the same direction. So the water will meet the fire wherever the ventilation may be. So it doesn't have any effect on the capability of the, irrespectively if it's a high pressure system or it's a low pressure or it's a dilute system. And the second one comes, I think, more from foam industry, maybe. If you have an accident where the fuel is not necessarily on the top of the vehicle, but it's sort of spillage, to what extent this technology would still work with a pool fire? As we are perfectly aware that it has no way to interfere with the fuel surface at all, right? So, yeah. So, again, we have differentiated between a dilute system attacking a pool fire, or it's a water mist system attacking a pool fire. However, talking about a water mist solution attacking a pool fire is very efficient, and even more efficient than a dilute system. Really? And as efficient, that's to say, I came as efficient as a foam. Even the bigger the fuel spillage is, the more efficient it is. You have immediately, I mean, really immediately, within seconds, activate the system, you will have such a preparation factor that you have to see it's totally absorbed. And we did some in coming back to the test that we did in Norway, where we did fuel spillage pool fires up to 30 or 40 megawatts fires. And within two minutes, it was totally extinguished. Extinguished? smaller fuel spillage, you don't get that big evaporation effect. So it takes a little bit longer time. Of course, we know that a foam, it will totally isolate. But I mean, if you, I have seen some American research, I will find that research for you. You will see they try to compare the extinguish time between foam systems, mixed foam, water mist systems, and water mist systems alone. And it's minor differences. I mean, really, really minor differences. I have one more myth. What about the visibility? Have you observed any effects related to the loss of visibility in the extinguishing region? So, also, again, then you have to lean up to some specifications or requirements. Also, again here, we lean up to, or the fire lab leaned up to what you say is accepted in NFPA 502, where you have, should we say, fire amps or lamp bulbs, which on a certain distance have to be visible, meaning that you can see exit signs and so on, and we performed very well, as you can probably, I don't know if you can see in that report, but then in another report you can see that... But this is part of evaluation. If you look into when we do videos, when we activate the system, you can do that for a dilute system, you can do that for a water mist system. And of course, there is some slight difference between a high pressure and a low pressure, because the dense, the small droplets will make it a little bit more, should we say, dense to look into, but you will see people downstream 50 meters easily. So for sure it will live up to the requirements, whatever is within NFPA 502, for sure. I think it's important to talk about this, because it's always being dropped in the middle of a discussion as an aha moment. Okay, but we will not see... The technology is great, but you will not see anything, so it cannot be used. But I mean, also, then also, again, you have to look into the practical. So how is the FIRE strategy implemented into... Typically, you have to look into the practical. So how is the fire strategy implemented into a tunnel? Typically, you could, of course, have people into the tunnel when you activate the system, but what you will try to do is to get people out of the tunnels before you activate the system. That's the typical approach, I would say. I usually tell them I would rather be wet and with bad visibility than exposed to 250 megawatts. I mean, if I had the choice, I would rather be wet and burned down. Yeah, okay. Johnny, I'm very thankful for sharing your views on this important subject, and you also armed me up for better discussions with my local authorities for the future tunnel projects, for the future tunnel projects because I see immense value in using active fire systems in tunnels to reduce the risks. I'm also very, in a way, happy and surprised we've mostly talked about life safety because from our perspective, usually the extinguishing systems are part of the safety of the building or structural safety or the money aspects, not necessarily life safety. But I'm happy that your research was very life safety oriented. And are there some resources available publicly that people could read up or watch? Yeah, for sure. There was a webinar, right? Yeah, for sure. We, that's part of our company policy. We have nothing to hide. I mean, all the research that we do, we put that public. If they go into our websites or to the LinkedIn website, probably it's the better one because I released a lot of reports and posts there regarding the test. So looking for TumpoCheck in LinkedIn, then they will find good material. I will search for that and put that in the show notes so the audience can just go there with one click and share the resources. From what I saw, it's worth spending a few minutes of your time taking a look into them. They were very interesting. Johnny, thank you so much for coming to the Fire Science Show in person. I appreciate that a lot. And yeah, all the best. Thank you so much. It was a pleasure to be part of that. And that's it. It was a great experience for me, not only because I've learned so much about Wotan's systems in tunnels, but also the whole process of recording this episode was fantastic as Johnny has visited me in my office and I had a very rare chance to make a live interview and I prefer it very much over online. It's much easier and such a better contact with the guests to have them inside your office and just discuss fire. From the episode itself, the interesting part for me was the discussion about the ventilation and the fact that it was accounted for in the experiments. It's very important to have ventilation effects accounted for in any tunnel experiment and they did. It was astounding to learn that their heat release rate was 250 megawatts. That's a huge fire and actually led to destruction of the tunnel where they were doing their experiments, which is probably not that funny. But yeah, that's what huge fires do. And it's great that we can actually do that in a controlled environment, measure that, and learn new things even from, let's say, catastrophic fire tests. It was also very interesting when he mentioned the differences between the chemical heat release rate and what's being transported. And that's a really powerful one because, you know, the chemical heat release rate is what the fire emits when things burn. He was so focused on the convective heat transfer outside of the immediate zone where the fire is located. So how much heat actually goes to the left and right of the tunnel when the fire is burning? And they've observed insane reductions in this heat release rate. So it means that maybe the chemistry of the fire was quenched to like 50 megawatts. Maybe not completely, but the amount of heat that the fire actually released into the tunnel was removed by a factor of 10 or maybe even 20. And I find it as an immense gain with the proposed system. Johnny has also mentioned some engineering guidelines like SOLID that can be used to design systems or experiments I'll try to link them, he also has some resources which I've already received so I'll try to share them with you and I hope you found it interesting to learn a bit about water mists and extinguishing big fires in tunnels for me it was very worth my time, I hope it's the same for you. So for today, that's it. Next week, we're going to have the last episode of this year because afterwards I will be going for a two-week break. I planned Christmas break with the family. Need to recharge a bit. So yeah, kind of a Christmas episode next week. Maybe even less fire science-ish, but I hope more fun for you. So you don't want to miss that one. And, yeah, see you next Wednesday. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
