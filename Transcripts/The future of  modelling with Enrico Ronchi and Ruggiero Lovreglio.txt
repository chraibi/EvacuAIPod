 Hi everybody, hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 16. A nice round number to the bar of four. Nice to have you here. Today we're going to discuss evacuation modeling, a part of fire science engineers' life that's always there. If you're doing any type of analysis, you're usually relating them to the human safety. And the human safety factor is usually evaluated by the means of modeling the evacuation, the egress phenomenon. And today I have two guests. Both of them are renowned experts in modeling evacuation and researching the various aspects of how people escape buildings, the decision processes, the choices they make, and the factors that influence the whole process. Both are Italians for some reason. I don't know if it's a thing, but it seems Italians are powerful in this field of fire science. They're both connected. One was a supervisor, one was a student. Now they're both professors. They're both are young stars of fire engineering. So yeah, please join me in welcoming Professor Enrico Ronchi from Lund University and Professor Ruggiero Lovreglio, also known as Rino from Massey University in New Zealand. The idea for this episode came to me when I was preparing a presentation for Polish experts on the current state and the future of evacuation modeling. Back then, I sent an email to Rino and Zendiko to ask them what do they feel about the future of evacuation modeling. And I've received some really cool and vibrant answers, and I immediately asked them to maybe share them with you in here. And here we are discussing all these things from simulations in buildings to virtual reality and augmented reality, data gathering, and other concepts of evacuation modeling up to wildfire evacuation. So it's jam-packed with action. I hope you really enjoyed this one. So yeah, without further ado, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to to Fire Science Show. I'm today with not one, but two fantastic experts on evacuation modeling. With me today, Professor Enrico Ronchi from Lund University in Sweden. Hi, Enrico. Hi. Hi, Wojciech. Nice to see you and hear you. Great to see you as well. And from the almost exactly opposite side of the globe, Professor Ruggiero Vreglio from Massey University in New Zealand. Good evening, Rino. Hello, everyone. Nice to be here. And thank you for inviting me. Thanks for taking the invite, guys. And I really appreciate that. I've invited you because I wanted to discuss with someone the future of evacuation modeling and how it's being used and how it can be used in the future for for better and i was thinking about an expert and i figured out i know two experts and they're both italian they're both nice so should work out here you are if if it doesn't work i'll send you both a pineapple pizza okay so before we we catch up for the podcast, I asked you about some ideas about the future of evacuation modeling. But let's start with how modeling is done today. And I just want to ask you this cheesy question. What do you think is the role of evacuation modeling in current fire safety engineering for you. Enrico, maybe you can start. I see evacuation modelling as a useful tool within performance-based design in terms of, yeah, we use it to calculate our set, but not only nowadays, because it also gives us the opportunity to identify critical bottlenecks in buildings. So even to spot if there are some potential issues in a given design. And also the part that is very powerful is the one that relates to the fact that we can simulate several what-if scenarios. This put us in a great position, especially when we want to consider scenarios indeed like fires, in which we don't really often know exactly what will happen, but we can guess a set of reasonable set of scenarios about what could happen. I see it as a very powerful and useful tool, but there is a but, there is always a room for improvement. Otherwise, we will all, let's say, be happy and never improve if we don't think about this in this way but at the moment i will say it's still a useful tool for performance-based design and not only so also to have a rough idea on how building works in terms of design when you put people in it and you put different behavioral scenarios in it arino yeah i want to add that but it's also good for people that work in the industry because they are not automated models that you just tell him this is the building, do the work for me. So we still need brains and engineers capable to understand what are the parameters to put inside those models to try to mimic as much as we can reality. And that's why most of the course that you will find around the world, they don't teach you just to click the buttons. the course that you will find around the world. They don't teach you just to click the buttons. And that's the things that probably we say to all our students that probably your cousin that is a geek in computers will be much more capable to use any software that is around the world. But you are going to get paid in the future because you are capable to understand what's the theory of human behavior in FHIR and try to do your best in integrating those theory and the right numbers as the input of those model. Because the main issues is that at this stage, those model are heavily rely on the inputs that the user put on it. Yeah. So you're saying by understanding how to build the model, you understand the human aspect better and in general, it gives you closer to a safer building. Like electric vehicle forces you to save energy by driving more calmly in a way. That's a good one. For me, as someone, I'm not a researcher in this field. My research overlaps with evacuation sometimes, but it's not my principal area of research. But I'm using a lot of evacuation modeling in my engineering practice. And for us, sadly, it's an R-set calculator, usually. Well, in ITB, we would do this bottleneck scan that Enrico mentioned. I think this is very powerful because, in general, buildings work. If you build a building to a code and you have these evacuation paths that are required, at least by the Polish code, it usually leads to more or less safe building. Not perfect, but not horrible either. But this bottleneck can be very limiting for the evacuation process. When you have the complex geometry of the building, it's a perfect tool to scan for that. However, it takes some skill and knowledge, and especially the constants of the behavior or speed, which we'll touch touch in a second are very important to be defined. Alino, I know you also use a lot of this modeling or these approaches connected with virtual and augmented realities to study the behaviors and I think it's something that opened up lately a lot. So how does this interplay with the evacuation modeling? We must say that most of the work done in virtual reality wasn't initiated by me. There are people that have done much more on this. Just to mention Max Kinateder did a full PhD student in integrating virtual reality. And also Enrico and Daniel Nilsson did quite a lot of application of virtual reality. Nielsen did quite a lot of application of virtual reality. So basically, they prepared the road for me. I basically followed the path that was already defined by them. And as you can imagine, virtual reality gives you the possibility to build evacuation systems that don't exist, or to test a new concept of evacuation system and try to see if they work. concept of evacuation system and try to see if they work. And you can see, for instance, one of the most relevant papers on this is the paper written by Enrico on the tunnel exit. If you think in the past, before having this kind of study, the poor Daniel Nielsen was supposed to manufacture the system and bring people, stop a tunnel and bring people in a tunnel. You can imagine from a logistic point of view, it was a nightmare. Yes. But at that time, it was also a nightmare to have virtual reality back then because it was incredibly expensive. It was like something unbelievably expensive. And now it's becoming so cheap that it's becoming quite easy in labs to have it and use it for a testing evacuation system and also to push a bit the boundaries, study a bit social interaction. And, for instance, Max Kinateter did a lot of good studies on social interaction. In my case, I belong more from the path of, I'm not a psychologist, I'm more oriented by the transportation guys in which we try to put many variables and try to see how many factors can affect the behavior of people. And virtual reality gave me the possibility to experiment what would be the decision making of different evacuees, consider different combination of variables. And there was something that it wasn't possible even for my PhD. In fact, in my PhD, I had to use non-immersive technology. But then now, since the price is dropping and buying VR headset, it became quite easy for everyone. It allowed me to do much more immersive study to go deeper and try to understand how different combination of variables and factors can affect the decision making of people. And this is something awesome. and factor can affect the decision making of people. And this is something awesome. Bottom level, you can buy a cardboard and put your smartphone in it and you have some sort of virtual reality, which is actually not that horrible. You were referring to the Dissuasive Exits paper, if I'm correct, right? That's one of them. The one that I was referring to was about, it's a paper on far technology, on... Flashing lights is the one, on flashing lights. It's the one on flashing lights. And the good things that the follow up of the paper led by Enrico, it was like to prove that the experiment done in a cave that he took. I think the cave is still incredibly expensive. And the same experiment done in a really cheap headset end up pretty much with the same results. in a really cheap headset, end up pretty much with the same results. So at least for testing a fire safety system, you can even use pretty cheap devices that might cost you $1,000, $2,000 or even less, and still you can do really cool things. And Enrico probably can tell you more about that because he was leading. Yeah, I mean, the idea there was that for the fire safety engineering purposes, when it comes to studying a vacation system, we originally did some studies in a cave that we have at Lund University. The cave is basically a full-scale room in which we have projectors and we deploy VR there, having some sort of ultrasound system that track your movement in VR. Those are very expensive labs. in VR. Those are very expensive labs. And this is what was traditionally used, let's say, for more than 20 years to do VR experiments at the same type of lab that they have, for instance, at the University of Wolfsburg, the one that Reno mentioned with Max Kinneather. But then what we did after doing this experiment to test how a certain type of evacuation system worked, we thought, okay, what will we get if we use a much cheaper VR solution? So if we use some sort of a headset. And we went for the cheapest we could find on the market pretty much because we went for a cardboard with a phone inside. And I mean, if we look at certain type of variables that do not get so much impact from the interaction with environment, but it's more like a visual system that you are interacting with. We saw that results were pretty consistent. So it was very encouraging to see that basically you could get a reasonable understanding of what will happen in a fire evacuation scenario using a very cheap virtual reality system. So that was the idea. And again, we have to be careful in generalizing these things, because it might be that there are scenarios which require more interaction for which there is an advantage in using more immersive systems. But in most of the engineering problems that we have for fire evacuation design, we often have to decide between different evacuation systems or different design choices. So things like that affect the actual layout of the building or that affect the actual installations that we put in the building. So in those cases, often it is possible to have a quite decent grasp on how people will interact with those by using fairly cheap VR. And again, this is something that from being expensive and rich labs at university, now they are consumer products that basically pretty much anyone can afford. Do you have to go through ethics committee for these experiments or how does the path look? We have to go through ethics committees, mostly every country and every place in the world and different rules. But in Sweden, we have a national committee that evaluates, let's say, the risks and possible issues, for instance, with personal data protection and so on, of the experiments that we do. So when we deal with human subjects, basically, we have to go through ethics. But at the end of the day, the type of experiments that we do, they are not too different from what is a gaming experience. Actually, I will say that it's much more mild. It's much milder compared to certain games that we have nowadays. You don't have to run over people or shoot at people compared to certain games that we have nowadays. You don't have to run over people or shoot at people like in certain games. So it's more like experiencing a fire scenario and a vacation scenario. But again, we have procedures in place for making sure to minimize risks. Because, you know, there are still a portion of people that may get dizzy when they use VR or they may feel nausea and so on. I've asked that because I know it's hell to get a fire experiment approved, like exposing people to real smoke in real smoking conditions. I once talked with Daniel Newsom and he told me he has horrible issues getting an experiment like subway station approved because of his willingness to use the real people. And then these experiments with real people are also usually for some reason limited, you know, a population of healthy students. While your VR set, when it's cheap and easy to deploy, it's also something that could be used to cross cultural boundaries. You could run the same experiment in multiple places of the world to expose different populations with different backgrounds. And, you know, in a way, our evacuation modeling, the fundamental diagrams, the pre-evacuation times are, let's say, like very white European population bias, right? Because it's been Lund, it's been Greenwich, it's been generally European units that have been developing that. So, yeah, I wonder what they think is the future of these prescriptive approaches, like the fundamental diagram, the speed versus density plots, the pre-evacuation distributions are the things that currently probably determine the output of evacuation modeling more than the physics of the model itself, or often in a comparable way, yeah? I got that we are trying to open than the physics of the model itself or often in a comparable way yeah i got that we are trying to open here the can of worms because there are a lot of standard curves that have been using for years that have been generating for specific types of population and there is a lot of papers that we are bringing in the field and showing that those curves can be probably too conservative for some cases, but in other cases won't be conservative at all. So that means that we might get in trouble if we use, we expect that those curves represent the real behavior, the real trends of pedestrian dynamic, and then they are not exactly that. And the issues that we have now is that we try to find, if we don't use the standard curves, like, for instance, the SFP curves, we try to find curves that we're collecting in a population that were as similar as possible as the population that we might expect in the building that we are designing. And this is still an issue because that means that we need to have incredible different variations of those curves. An interesting work that was initiated by Daniel Nielsen, Karen Boyce, Steve Winnie, and Denise. I can't remember her surname, sorry. McGrath, McGrath. Sorry, Denise. It was like trying to find really fundamental, fundamental diagrams. So fundamental square diagrams in which you need just to define the physiometric characteristic of people and then the fundamental diagrams will show up as an input. And that's one of the things that I was telling you, like you can rely on the fine inputs of models like just because this is the standard curve i need to use that one at this stage you need to even find the fundamental curves that represented are closer to to your case study and for instance if someone is trying to do the job now it might go on the chapter 64 i guess of the sap chapter that is on engineering data written by Steve Wynne and Karen Boyce. And in that case, there is a huge collection of different kind of speed and fundamental relationship that you can find extracted from different experimental condition or real case. There's also your paper from NIST that covers a lot of specific scenarios. I tried to do something to help people to identify the right you help me thank you but the problem is some sometime when you publish this kind of paper you feel like i'm helping or i'm creating a bomb because if those curves and distribution are misused you're basically creating a damage for society instead of helping society. And that's the big risk. And that's why we put a lot of statements in the paper that you're referring about data set, evacuation, distribution, about be careful about who you select, because it might not really represent what you're trying to represent with your design. And to move away from this kind of approach with Enrico, we try to write and study a lot of other alternative approaches in which we actually try to model the decision making in terms of prevacuation instead of relying only on curves, because those can be the results of an agent-based modeling approach rather than a defined input. The problem is that now we use prevacuation as an input, but the dream will be that this the results of an agent-based modeling approach rather than a defined input. The problem is that now we use prevacuation as an input, but the dream will be that this will be the outcome of a model. So you just define the agent that it exists and it's in this place and whatever happens since you press play is the model, not your assumptions. On the other way, the provocation is that this might make a fire engineer useless at some point. But that's kind of an ideal world. If we manage to develop models that are capable to predict things without smart users, at some point we will get rid of fire engineers. But I think this is probably, we will see this in two, three generations. Well, I'm not sure if that would be a bad thing. I think you would not get rid of fire engineers because we are generating fire problems quicker than we can solve them. So there's always a job for fire engineers. Our job is very secure in that manner. And on the other hand, there is always not enough fire engineers around. I hope I won't receive any call because sometimes I tease my student, construction student, say that AI is going to take over and replace. And sometimes after the classes, there is some student that approaches me and says, you know, I'm really wasting my money because my parents are spending so much money on my degree. And then I make sure that they understand that it was basically a joke. What's your take on fundamental diagrams? I mean, you know, it's controversial in itself, even the word fundamental for fundamental diagrams. I mean, it's, you know, it's controversial in itself, even the word fundamental for fundamental diagrams, because... Sorry, are they fundamental because of physics, or are they fundamental because we have to use them, right? That's kind of the feeling sometimes, that we don't have anything better at the moment, so we have to go on with them. But there is also some aspects that I want to bring up that is a bit into what Bruno was mentioning before, that we are designing buildings today that will be used for several years from now. Decades. Yeah. So this means that we cannot really rely necessarily on design that is based on the population of today or even worse, population data that has been collected many years ago. Because the population demographics will change. We know that we're getting older and the prevalence of disabilities in the population is increasing. So we need to find ways to change this paradigm. Find a way to design buildings projecting what will be the population in those buildings. Not just looking at what it is today or even worse relying exclusively on what data we have from the past. Sometimes we use data that have been collected in the 70s, 80s, and so on. So we really need to change a bit that kind of a mindset that, okay, it's good enough to design something with what we have so far. We have to try to push the boundaries, especially as researchers. We have to try to see how we can solve this problem. especially as researchers, we have to try to see how we can solve this problem. One thing in this aspect that I want to bring up is also regarding the, let's say, variability of possible population that you can have in a building. To me, recently I've been involved in quite some work looking, for instance, at different type of disabilities and or what type of functional limitations people may have in a building. And I would say in fire safety, we are very much behind compared to other fields like accessibility or even looking at the medical science. So, you know, often you read the fire code and you read something like, okay, you should take appropriate provisions for people with disabilities. But, you know, there is so many possible disabilities, so many possible situations and scenarios that we should have to take into consideration. So one important step that research should do is to try to categorize in a much more systematic way the populations that we have based on the functional limitations that people can have. that we have based on the functional limitations that people can have. So what are their characteristics? What are possible limitations that can affect egress and so on? So that's an important step, especially if we look at the future, because we know that we are getting older and older on average as population, which means that also we're getting more and more people that have more issues during evacuation. So I think this is an important topic that paradoxically has not been so much investigated. To me, I mean, I see as one of those things that we should really put a lot of emphasis in research because it's going to be more and more important in the future. This is also something I am asked about in, let's say, one out of three buildings that I do, that how did you account for disabled people in your evacuation modeling? And I usually say I've hidden them in my safety margin, you know, because I don't really feel I have a powerful way to account for them today. I could technically assume a small portion of the population in my model is disabled and has completely different, let's say, movement or pre-decision time characteristic than the rest of my population, and then place these few people randomly around the building. But then we come to the problem of how this exotic point affects the outcome of the whole simulation. And when my population is uniform, I reach convergence fairly quickly on random distribution of people in my building because if I run five, maybe ten simulations, it usually will converge to a value. But when you have these exotic points, basically few people among a hundred or a thousand in your building, you would probably have to run a thousand simulations to find this effect and eventually figure out the bottleneck scenario. So it seems like a very costly procedure. So I prefer to hide behind the safety margins. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. I guess that's one way of doing it, but we are still in a situation in which even if we want to model explicitly the wide range of possible disabilities and how can they affect the evacuation. It's very hard because we know relatively little. So often you see, for instance, in buildings, especially more complex buildings, that you have dedicated solutions for people with disabilities. But as a general thought, also for that, I think we have to move away from that concept. I know that this is practically often implemented, but the ideal scenario would be to find a solution that equally works for everyone. And if you're using a solution that works for people with disabilities, generally works also very well for the standard or whatever we want to call it, the adult population, whatever standard means. Because again, the standard actually, we're going to get to the point that we have to change what is the concept of standard population, because this is what it is about here. The future building will have more and more, let's say, variability. So that's why I think it's a reasonable approach, what you're doing, Wojciech, nowadays. But if we look as research, we have to look at the future. And that's something that we should change. At least we should try to characterize better the populations as it is now. And then the projection of the future is the next step. I think it's also now with the tools becoming available like this immersive setups or just virtual reality, without exposing these people to true harm, allows you to really quantify things that you could never do in the past like you would not put i mean it's hard to put students into a smoky tunnel and think about trying to do experiments with disabled people on the same setup it's i think it would not be possible and yet today you may have chances to to quantify this i also i also think to what extent we can capture this data from the drills or real fire accidents. Like the buildings today are armed with CCTV cameras. So technically, if you have a shopping mall evacuated, if you have a cinema evacuated, you can pretty much figure out with machine learning what happened, where people did move, right? So how do you feel these sources of data can play around in making what you just said before? Yeah, well, they will definitely help, I will say. But yeah, there is all sorts of problems that are more related to privacy issues, because, you know, then we enter a territory into like, to which extent are we even allowed to use cctv cameras or whatever other data i know for instance arena has worked a lot with gps data you know or uh even you know there are people that use the traces of your phone in a building the the big issue here is not the technical feasibility because there is a lot of work already being done in this. But it's, are we even allowed to do this? So for the good of science, I would argue that we should. But sometimes go to an ethical committee and explain that you want to film everyone in a building for one year until something happens that is interesting for you as a researcher. And you can check whoever is in that building all the time. I mean, it's hard to convince both the ethical committee and even the owners of the buildings very often that we do it for the good of science. If I can expand on that, sometimes, paradoxically, I've been recording drills in some buildings in which there were CCTV videos. CCTV videos, but they told me it's easier if you put, I mean, from a regulation point of view, this institution, it was much easier to get the approval to put my own mini cameras and record the drill rather than using the, follow the process to get the video through all the process that they had in place to access the video through the CCTV cameras. Sometimes it's incredibly complex, the process that you need to follow to get access to video that are normally recorded. And I had the same issues here in my university to get access to the CCTV recording of drills, to go through a really, really heavy protocol and explanation of why and how the data will have been used. And sometimes it became really, really challenging even to get access of recording of even tragedies of a real accident. So probably easier to get them from YouTube than from... Sometimes it happens that you find papers that are based on social media videos. There is a bit of mismatch there, I have to say, on how much care and attention there is in research about data protection and what you see out there. I mean, it's like if you see a TV show and you see like they do a social experiment, many of those things will never get approved by an ethical committee. But it's a TV show, so they get away with it. So it's kind of, I mean, as a researcher, sometimes it feels really strange that there is a different social acceptance between what are you allowed to do as a researcher, and in theory, as a researcher, you are the one that knows how to do these things according to ethical standards, and what the rest of the world can do, because pretty much... For entertainment. For entertainment, or whatever other reason, you know, because, I mean, we could open now a very long discussion about privacy and how much we give away our data to the world without even knowing sometimes versus how much we are sometimes restrictive to give our data to researchers that will actually make a good use out of it. They will not try to sell us something. actually make a good use out of it. They will not try to sell us something. That's in a way horrible because what you want the data for is to essentially make the building safer for exactly these people. And when you go into their privacy, you go for this particular part of privacy, which is behavior choices, movement patterns, not why Karen went to shop to buy this particular product no you want to know what what was in her head to choose the road that she picked up so you can design it in a way that in a fire she'll have a better chances to escape me as a fire engineer we usually people don't know how much time and engineering it takes to buy them one minute of a time. Like how much work I have to put to extend my available time in the car park for one minute. And then you see a fire and this one minute was well spent for creating a new video for YouTube. And it's kind of painful, you know. But here I've jumped into another aspect. Like you've mentioned we have this data that comes from 80s, 90s, 70s. Like fire safety is a field built on tragedies. And in evacuation, we had this huge fire in Las Vegas. Then it was the World Trade Center. These were the events that triggered like a breakthrough or leap through research projects. And then there was no cell phones. People were working in a completely different way. If you called your friend to meet him on Friday in the plaza at noon, he would be there without sending seven text messages. And if he was not, it was not a huge issue either. So you would just live on with your life and today the society and the individual behavior is like completely different not to mention the shape of a human i'm definitely not fitting the anthropogenic average of a of a male in my age from the from the 70s i have a big much bigger moment of inertia and but this this you know, we base our modeling on these assumptions. So can we leap forward? And you also said something very important, Enrico, that is it enough to leap forward to today or we have to leap forward to tomorrow? Because ultimately, if you design the building today, it will be used in 50 years. And who will be using the building then? Some Jetson people. How do you think we can make this leap in a reasonable way, or can we even make it? Somehow, I think that in the future, we will have an easier way to communicate with people inside the building, because our buildings are slowly, I should say, really slowly getting smarter and smarter. And one of the main issues that we have and we used to have in the past in many tragedies is not because we had a lot of casualties of people getting harmed, not because they were panicking, but because they didn't have the right information at the right time. the future is that those buildings and all the technology that we have available will allow us to have right information much quicker and help us to to make the right choice and that's gonna i feel like that the the building are somehow is gonna are gonna become safer because this channel of information is gonna get better and better and if you know already where is the fire and you have the possibility to communicate to the building occupants where they need to go and what they need to do in real time, they will make a big, big change in the future. And you were mentioning before, augmented reality is something that now we are just conceptualizing about. We are doing some small experiment, but you can already imagine that from here to 10, 20 years, holograms will be in a part of our life that will be like a smartphone now. Now we are looking at a smartphone and thinking, how the hell we've managed to live without a smartphone? All people were capable to find a place without Google Maps or meet each other at the right time or even when they were traveling together with two different cars. All they managed to not to get lost. Yeah. For my generation, it was like that. It was crazy. Instead, you find a way. And I think that augmented reality and holograms are gonna make our life safer and easier if we use it in the right way because we can use hologram to to guide people to communicate with people in a more dynamic way if you think now we have uh dynamics that we don't have much dynamic system that lead you towards the the best exit we have just static lights that are need need to be there just to tick a box most of the time because the code tell you to do it there and where we put most of the sign signal of course on the top because you need to see them but the smoke goes on the top so there is a lot of things that you do it for checking the box, but from a human behavior perspective and performance perspective, you know already that it's not going to work. If you go into dynamic systems, they are dynamic in, let's say, transferring information, but the scenarios for this transfer are still static. So if you have a fire at the seventh floor, they will trigger to this area. If not, they will trigger to other area. And from my experience, the ones that I've met, they were like locally connected to sensors. So if there's a fire behind the door, it will show X. But it does not like really think about what's the optimal way. But it does not like really think about what's the optimal way. And we also are arming our buildings with sensors, with a lot of devices. And it's a theme on the podcast. Whoever I speak with, they see this immense value of arming the building up. So can we use this, let's say, smartness of a building to maybe guide the evacuation process? let's say, smartness of a building to maybe guide the evacuation process? And if we can, should we or can we include that in our modeling? Because if ultimately, like, I can imagine that arming a building with a smart system would make it safer. But should I, in my modeling, take it into account that the building is smart, is safer, and the evacuation time is quicker? Or should I go conservative? At this stage, we'll go conservative, of course. But if you plan for a conservative scenario, and then you manage to bring in a building technology that is going to make it much more efficient from a safety point of view, that means that it's going to be even better than what you designed. If I go conservative in my modeling, how do I explain to my client why they should put additional money on the sensors if they don't benefit? And Nico, you've mentioned smart buildings in the past. I see what you mean. Yeah, I understand the problem because then we go always to the bottom line as engineers. And sorry, if you go conservative, you can just say, okay, there's 5,000 people in my building. The speed they can exit doors is one person per meter per second. So it's going to take these amounts of seconds. End of the calculation. Why model anything else? There are two aspects here. One aspect is something that, unfortunately, in most cases, safety is still seen as a box that we need to tick. Compliance, not safety. Exactly. As a boss, we need to take compliance, not safety. Exactly. So in an ideal world, safety would be, for instance, if you go to a hotel, safety would be as much rated as comfort or other things that will make you choose one over another. But unfortunately, the reality is that very often this is not the case. So you need to meet the minimum bar. Then if you are exceeding that minimum, let's say very little people care. And often the clients don't want to even pay for exceeding that minimum. Not in all the cases, but in most of the cases. What I will see as an ideal, let's say, an ideal setup to really exploit what we have nowadays will be something like that connects these sensors with a modeling system. So even smarter in a way. So and there are a few attempts of research groups that have tried to do that. I know that the group in Greenwich has started. So basically you have a building that is rigged with sensors. This information is sent to a simulator. The simulator also knows where the people currently are, knows where the threat is, also knows where the people currently are, knows where the threat is, and then run a set of what-if scenarios and analyze what is the best route to indicate to people to get the quickest and the safest evacuation. I mean, it sounds like sci-fi nowadays, but we're actually not that far from getting there. I mean, there are a few things to solve concerning, let's say, reliability of such systems and, you know, legislation, things have to hold during a fire, everything, the communication. Directional communication, because today it's simple. If your fire sensor detects the fire and dies, it's okay, because it did its job, yeah? But here, if your human counting mechanism fails at some point. Fails, yeah. And then you are in trouble because you don't know anymore which direction to indicate to people. You don't want to point towards the threat and so on. It is not as much far in the future the way I see it, but there is quite some work to be done yet, not simply on the technical side, but on the redundancy setup that you have and the reliability of such type of system. Because that would be really ideal. So like to have really smart building that makes smart people, if you know what I mean. That's the way forward, the way I see it. Because all these systems that we have now tested, like, you know, you see this face is signage and active signage and so on. This, you know, there is research that tells you even how to design to provide the correct information to people so again we have some ground research already in there but what is missing is like okay we need really some very large company with a lot of money to put in into actually making something reliable and resilient. I can say that, for instance, here in the West Thailand of New Zealand, it's called Australia. Some Australia might get hurt with this joke. We have even a company that is producing those of the dissuasive sign. But the problem is that you can develop all the manufacturing, all the system that you want, but from a legislation point of view, we need to address who is going to be accountable for responsibilities if the system fails. So it's not just a matter of developing the technology, but also rethink about the way we share responsibility in terms of who is accountable for what to do after a disaster. Developing the technology and creating the algorithms is the easy part. Making the world use them is the hard part. We've learned the hard way in smoke control. If you come up today with a new smoke control solution that is much better than the previous ones, it does not matter. As long as the previous ones are compliant and there is no economic incentive in using the new system, it will not be adopted. While any smallest economic incentive, like this solution makes it cheaper, then immediately a landslide starts where people put money investing in these technologies, improving them. Eventually, you get with a very optimized solution beyond the point where you cannot optimize anymore. And this solution gets implemented in the buildings. And this is why I've asked you, you know, that how can we account for having these advanced solutions? Because if I don't show incentive to my stakeholders, they will, yeah, that's pretty cool, but I have a yacht to buy. If I can add something, Wojciech, one other thing that you can do is that we should not have this kind of smart census just for safety. So if we use systems for multipurpose, so I make an example, like a couple of years ago, I was involved in a research project with CERN in Switzerland. And these guys, they have all sorts of technology, as you can imagine. And for instance, they use robots for maintenance of their tunnels. So they have a railing system with robots, basically already in there. So I said, okay, you have this there, so why we don't use it also for safety purposes? So why we don't rig this with some sort of signage to move around, chase the people and indicate the way? And I mean, again, it sounds like sci-fi, but they actually bought this idea, and we even tested it in VR to try to see how it works, and it actually does work. Because the buildings are getting smarter and smarter, so they have many things in there already. So if you are using something that is already in there or you are proposing a system that can be exploited not just for safety but also for other purposes, I think that's the winning argument for a client saying, okay, look, you are putting this in, but you say, purpose that you have in the building. That should be a good extra selling argument. Sinian, in his episode, he was facing the same problems as we now in this talk, because he mentioned about HVAC sensors that are used in the building, but not used for safety, for example. They're used to control the climate in the building. So you have to measure temperature, humidity, and some other parameters of there, which could be useful for example. They're used to control the climate in the buildings, so you have to measure temperature, humidity, and some other parameters of there, which could be useful for fire when it's developing in a building. And I think he mentioned something very smart. High-value, high-risk buildings, such as tunnels, big museums, could be a great playground for these approaches. In modern tunnels, you already have very powerful CCTV systems with accident detection, so they know if a car stopped, they know if a person exited the vehicle. You have this two-way communication, at least in the tunnels in Poland, you would have some sort of voice alarm system and a microphone to communicate with the people inside the tunnel. So these buildings could be like a testing ground to figure out these solutions. And if they work, then maybe we can show how they help in the buildings. And if we do that, maybe we can scale up to, let's say, buildings in general. That's a good route ahead. And from this discussion, I'm kind of surprised it did not come up yet that we could do a little bit better job connecting like CFD and evacuation modeling, you know, the viability of asset-asset concept, or this is another kind of sure-storming you don't want to open. I find this fascinating because it's like the dream of evacuation modelers since evacuation modeling was born, to connect both and get rid of acid arsenic. And to weigh so that the actions of people affect the fire. That's the real missing part at the moment. Go on. I can start reading. Welcome to part two of the episode. At the moment, most of the models that do some sort of coupling, they take the fire outputs and they put it in a vacation model and they try to affect the behavior with all sorts of limitations that we are aware of. For instance, I mean, the one that is the biggest and more evident to me is the CFD calculates visibility and how this is then. I mean, Wojciech, I don't have to explain this to you. But, you know, for me that I'm on the other end with the RSAT, I mean, this sounds like it should be priority one for any CFD model to improve the visibility submodels in CFD, because that's what really matters for evacuation. improve the visibility sub-models in CFD because that's what really matters for evacuation. Everything else is kind of, yeah, kicks in afterwards. The visibility criteria is the one that screw up everything generally. You cannot be triple dead. I mean, if you die because you lost path, you're down. It doesn't matter if the temperature killed you twice. Exactly, exactly. matter if the temperature killed you twice exactly exactly so i mean the the ideal thing would be actually to have a real integrated tool in which the actions of people down the line have a direct impact also on the fire calculations because you know better than me that if you open a door close a door or do anything in the building that can have an impact on the configuration of the building layout. That's like you change boundary conditions. It's another scenario. This is fantastic that you've mentioned, because it blows my mind how we are not doing that. And even in practice, we are doing the complete opposite. I've done CFD simulations because I was forced to, unwillingly, to show that when you close the door to a compartment, your corridor is free of smoke. I'm like, seriously, I don't need to do CFD simulations to tell you that if you close the door, it's going to be okay. Oh yeah, but we need this scenario. The fire expert wants, but why? Why would I simulate a fire in a compartment where I close the door before the fire starts but they wanted it and and here what you mentioned if you follow a person and you know they left there's a let's say 50 chance they left the door open or closed yeah in the room that's two completely different cd simulations of that of that scenario so um you're right two-way integration is something so you're right two-way integration is something and also with some sort of let's say probabilistic approach because you will not know it's not only about if they leave a door open and it's also when and what happens so it's like in this case you could go directly for probabilistic approach in which you could set up a series of possible scenarios and see the consequences on the global probability of having something to happen and what is the impact. Ruggero, you did something like that with this evacuation of a musical festival, a chemical accident near it. Yeah, this wonderful idea. No, it wasn't a real idea. The real story, sudden real story is that I was writing my thesis, my PhD thesis, and I was getting mad. So Enrico told me, I'll give you something to work. But still, the problem was still the same that affect the far simulation. And I'm not entirely sure that this is right, because if you think like a crowd moving, a crowd is moving here, is creating a perturbation in the field where you're simulating. Because when you do the simulation, for instance, that we use in that case, we're done in CFD with the best that we could do considering the computational power that we had. And it was done by the team in the gantt and of course it wasn't considered in the perturbation of movement of people in in the space but you were calculating doses and stuff yeah the things that we managed to do is to to get that the simulation done in cft enrico did the simulation about the evacuation with one of his students, and my work was just try to connect and calculate what was the dose of inhalated gases by those people, but the coupling once again was one directional, it wasn't directional. I mean that was also an outdoor scenario, so it's a bit less critical, I will say. But I mean, in principle, I still see a clear gap there. I've seen only very limited attempts to do them and mostly in a very premature research stage. So, you know, OK, I've seen a PhD. I think there was somebody doing a PhD on this topic in Greenwich at some point. But, you know, then I didn't see anything else. on this topic in Greenwich at some point. But, you know, then I didn't see anything else. So it's really hard also sometimes to convince, let's say, research funder that what we're doing at the moment is still very limited. Because you say, okay, but we have buildings until now. They stand. There is a clear gap there. Because this is something also on which we have limited knowledge from the human behavior perspective, you know. We have a general understanding of what action people could do, like things as what you mentioned, like leaving a door open or not leaving a door open and what is the probability and so on. But, you know, before putting this into a model, we will have to do a much more systematic investigation of what could happen. Okay, let's move back a bit one step. Let's take this two-dimensional coupling. Let's go back to one-dimensional coupling, so only the effects of the fire are simulated on the evacuees. But let's go back to outdoor, and let's talk wildfire evacuation, for example, where you evacuate not a building, but an area filled with people. And here you come to similar choices, actually, that you would have evacuating building because it's, again, a topic of the speed at which you can travel, the route choice model, and pre-evacuation time. It's just all the three elements are completely different. Yeah, I mean, it's the main added layer there is that we don't evacuate only in foot. That's the thing. So we have the traffic modeling part, which is a completely different world. I have to say it's much bigger than the pedestrian modeling world. It's much more investigated. There is much more critical mass of research that have looked into this, mostly for general use, not necessarily evacuation. But there has been also a lot of research. I know, Reno, you have been reviewing research on hurricanes and things like this but the main added complexity there is that you don't have any more two layers so the the fire threat and the pedestrian decision movement but you have the traffic as well so you have an additional layer and many people even argued that we should even neglect the pedestrian layer and just put much more effort on the... There is a lot of controversy here because there are some, especially in the traffic modeling, they argue that it's pretty much equivalent if you just put the pre-evacuation response curve to a traffic model without modeling like the pedestrian actions. So the time for a person to enter a car and start evacuating properly. Exactly. So basically ignoring what happens in the decision-making stage, but just aggregating this in a macroscopic way. I'm not a big fan of that approach, I have to be honest, because I still feel that there is a value. It's not necessarily something you have to do with a microscopic model, like agent-based. For large-scale computation, it, very heavy. I understand that. But even if you do it in a microscopic way, I think there is a value in trying to break down the pieces of the different phases and try to understand what could have an impact rather than just putting everything together into a curve. And it's a bit like the problem that we face in pedestrian modeling in a different scale so in pedestrian modeling now we use distributions because we don't really understand very well yet what actions could happen maybe we have some conceptual model or theories that explain like how people take decisions but we don't really know in detail and and i mean on the bigger scale probably the traffic models often they don't really want to dig into what happens in the scale of the building. They just care when you enter a car. And I think that's not the right approach. But maybe, Rino, I remember we talked about this a few times, right? I don't know. Maybe you have a different view. You are very close to the traffic modeling people, probably even more than me. to the traffic modeling people, probably even more than me. No, I think in this case, the main issues that we have is that we try to use those distributions for wildfire. I think that when we use this approach for building, we don't get much in trouble because it really contains space. But when we start thinking like you can use the distribution that has been observed in a completely different scenario to design or check the safety of another completely different area, it's quite critical. And I think that we are still in the stage in the wildfire field in which we know pretty much also here what are the factors that affect the decision of households. what are the factors that affect the decision of households, but we don't have yet enough modeling skills and data to do really accurate prediction of what will happen in a different community. And that's the first thing that I need to bring up. Regarding that, if we need to consider pedestrian or just traffic, also in this case, it really depends on the scenario that we are focusing because we know that in some case you can see even just Google it, just go on YouTube, you can see that some cases, some component of evacuation is driven by foot. It depends what are the safety scheme in place. And sometimes you need to use vehicle it depends on the area that you're considering it depends on the scenario that you are facing up it depends on the scale of details that you want to have in your simulation i think it's also connected to the preparedness because if your preparedness level is high and you're like understanding that such an event as massive evacuation must happen before the fire then you can plan better for like use of vehicles but if you see footage from i don't know greece or turkey the recent wildfires where people are in a way surprised by the fire when having the their whole day time at the sea and they are basically forced that there is no more time for vehicle evacuation towards the mainland the only way you can go is towards the sea. And they are basically forced. There is no more time for vehicle evacuation towards the mainland. The only way you can go is towards the sea and be picked up by boats. So this is a completely different setting in which this vehicle component, or at least the road vehicle component, is cut off. And all you have is pedestrian movement. But this is a response, not preparedness planning. And we might also acknowledge that there are some community that are much more prepared to wildfire because they've been experiencing them quite a lot, if you think a lot of Australians and Americans. Instead, there are new countries that didn't even know what was like, what a wildfire would look like, that are starting experiencing them because climate change is redrawing the maps of the area that are under risk. Enrico might tell you that after the first serious wildfire occurring in Sweden, we started receiving so many calls to get information. I would say that the amount of wildfire research in Sweden has been boosting in the last couple of years. I mean, a couple of years ago, it wasn't really me and a couple of brave folks. They were looking into the topic here in Sweden. But now it became really a hot topic because after the summer 2018, which was incredibly hit by a series of wildfires here in Sweden, everything changed in the perspective of people. wildfires here in Sweden. Everything changes in the perspective of people. You know, especially when we look at the population that traditionally they have a lot of wild and urban interface. So here in Sweden there is a tradition of liking to live close to the nature and being really in areas near the forest. Exactly. So you're really potentially very much exposed here. So it became really a hot topic. But I just also want to bring up, going back one second to the topic of what we should model in the wildfires. I mean, what we really need, for instance, if we really want to go down the path of a simplified macroscopic approach, they use just a traffic model and some sort of distribution for everything that happens before. traffic model and some sort of distribution for everything that happens before. We need to characterize what we have in an area. We have not done this. So how does the percentage of households versus hotels affect a pre-evacuation response curve in wildfire? We don't have a clue because, you know, it's a completely different story. If you are in your property that you want to defend, you are much more attached compared to if you are in a hotel that, okay, there is a fire. I can't wait to leave here. I don't care that I leave everything behind. So we don't have that research yet there. The only thing that I've seen now that has been done some research in Australia on this is on defining archetypes of people. So what different people in different conditions will do. There is some work done in Australia on this I've seen recently, but still we cannot really quantify with the macroscopic model. We don't have the tools nowadays to quantify with the macroscopic model. What is the, let's say, the impact that a certain number of households or imagine if you have a hospital. I mean, it's a completely different story. Either you go down the down the route of even school and if you're in school season or not in the school season right exactly so yeah i mean i think that for the knowledge that we have now we have to go down the path of combining pedestrian and traffic modeling but you know i i heard the different opinions on this i touched this subject i brought it up because the episode I wanted about the future of evacuation modeling. And as far as buildings are sexy, interesting, you know, and there's a lot to be done in buildings. Here, it's not a pothole to jump over. It's a whole canyon of problems to solve, to have an integrated approach of fire and evacuation modeling outside of a building in this urban interface. We're almost approaching like a global scale model, because if you just add weather to that, you may have like a continuous prediction system of what to do over a country. I can even give you some heads up that we are, as Enrico was saying, we are trying to use GPS data and try to observe a big chunk of population, track their behavior. And there is a lot of work I'm doing led by University of Florida, by Dr. Shilei Zhao. And with her, we are trying to understand when people decide to move and depending on the area where they are, if they are at their home. to move and depending on the area where they are if they are at their home try to understand how they move in in this scenario if they go directly away from the scenario if they need to stop in intermediate place and those big data can help us to handle some of those questions but it's still challenging because you get you might think ah big data is the solution for everything you you get some benefits of big sample size but you get the uncertainty that you don't ask people what they are doing while you're observing there. So I think it's one of the places where if I was a funding agency, I would put much more research funding if i would pick now between building and wildfire i would probably pick more about wildfire because especially because we are having this new wildfire even new zealand if you see the statistics of the number of wildfire that we are having here and the number of people that are forced to evacuate every year is getting pretty different compared what used to be 30 40 years ago okay for the last thing because I've previously mentioned that the predistribution times and distribution curves and stuff like that are very European-centric. And in a way, also, modeling is very connected to rich countries, buildings, and stuff. And there's like 1 billion people living in informal settlements. Do you think modeling can help us tackle the issues of managing safety in this type of communities? And, well, obviously, yes, but to what extent? And the second part of the question, is the current state of modeling sufficient to model such complex... Can I get that? Yeah, go on. Go ahead. I can tell you the story. And Massoud, my friend, is a prof in Karachi. Nerd University will be happy to hear that at some point. It's like now we are trying to write a paper on an evacuation drill that we run in Karachi, in Pakistan. And when we were planning the drill, I told him, OK, we set up the fire alarm and then we see what happened. And he looked at me and said, you know, you realize that we don't even have a fire alarm in this library. Okay. That's the issue. So we have some countries in which, unfortunately, the safety issues are not the priority yet. Because in this country, for instance, they are still coping to make sure that the building won't collapse like a pancake in some case and kill most of the people. So they need to invest much more money on focusing on other safety issues. But that's why I think it's maybe not an obligation, but it's something that we should try and do for them because they have bigger problems on their heads to worry about emergency response. Even though it's serious, probably the access to sanitary facilities or the structural integrity of the whole thing is more urgent for them. So I would be surprised to see local researchers developing solutions for these problems where they have something bigger on their mind. I personally try to help with this kind of collaboration. I mean, from my egoistic point of view, you can say, no, I just work with a specific university. But I find it's even interesting because you might discover running drills in this. For me, it's a complete different scenario to discover something that we never observed in let's call them western country and for me from a scientific point of view it's exciting to to discover because if you even think i've been in karachi i've been in pakistan and for me it was like a cultural experience that it blew my mind because you can see if you think that italian traffic is crazy go to paris and for me i was just with my smartphone recording the traffic because for me it was something unbelievable but saying that even the dressing code that they use there is completely different from our blue jeans in which you have a different way to walk and perform in case of... Which kind of changes the velocity, speeds and stuff like that, right? So far, there is only one paper that was published about Saudi Arabia addressing code impact on evacuation. So there is a lot of exciting research that can be done to discover... Enrico, what about modeling? Because when you design a building, you have the layout. So that's pretty much the building that's going to be built trying to represent informal settlements. Basically, some people, I saw you, some sort of machine learning algorithm by taking satellite photos and making it into some sort of a layout. It's still a work in progress. There is not too much, let's say, yet in terms of research. But there is a few groups around the world that are starting addressing the problem. I mean, the general problem with formal settlements, we have seen that now even in South Africa have started looking into this research, and they have a research group there doing fire science. Allenbosch, yes, fantastic group. Exactly. With Edinburgh they've been working. I know there are some companies that popped up that looked exactly at this. Kindling by Daniel Antononelli, that's a fantastic effort. Exactly. So I think these are all valuable efforts. But again, in the big picture, we as researchers, we sometimes hit a wall when we try to get funding for those kind of activities because I mean, there are some funding agencies that are more sensitive to this type of humanitarian work, but there are some funding agencies that are more sensitive to this type of humanitarian work, but there are some very, let's say, engineering-minded, Western-world-minded, too Western-world-minded focused, capitalist focused, that it's very hard to convince them, give me funding to study what's happening in Bangladesh or in Pakistan. We're actually trying to get a grant for wind cost damage on informal settlements like three or four years ago, maybe even five years ago with South African people. And we didn't get the funding. Their comment was like, well, we're not sponsoring that. It was like, we're not interested. And then two years ago, something has shifted because the Iris project was awarded to Edinburgh, where they focused ultimately on the fire safety of this. So it's also maybe a shift in politics that changes. So you have to be at the right place at the right time to get this funding, which is in a way ridiculous. And I mean, going back also to the topic of wildfires, I think this is totally applicable also there, because the level of preparedness and the level of let's say awareness even of the problem that there is changes what varies widely depending on where you are yeah and often we have the western world in mind but you know wildfires are not a problem only of the western world so and that's why i've always been pushed for trying to develop tools that are free and open you probably know that together with the with a group of people we are trying to develop tools that are free and open. You probably know that together with a group of people, we are trying to make an effort to develop a tool called Winity that is free and open for everyone. It's with the Imperial College, with Guillermo Reyn and a couple of other folks, NRC and FBA. So we're trying to put something out that could be used by anyone so that even if you don't have huge resources, you still have something to use. Because otherwise, you know, the risk is that if you put, if you develop something that is a commercial tool, I mean, who is going to use those tools? It's going to use who can afford them. And that's a bit like, I understand it that if you are a company, you have to pay your bills and so on. But us as universities, we probably should have a slightly different mission. And now as companies start to grow around this topic, they maybe are more successful in obtaining funds. They can go with a slightly different agenda than you can go with your projects. You're usually time limited, time constrained. The deadline is next Thursday and either you get a partner or not. So that's kind of limiting here. Hey, guys, thank you so much. I'm really thankful for this conversation. It's been very interesting and we've touched so many aspects of modeling and I have like ideas for seven more episodes now. So thanks a lot for coming here. Thanks a lot, Wojciech. It was really nice to talk to you. And as I said, it's the beginning of many conversations on this topic. I'm pretty sure that my fianc√© will be happy for a new podcast because whenever we have this, I'm the one washing the dishes. The sound restrictions of the podcast recording. It's a podcast. Yeah, now it's going to be my podcast. We can arrange that even daily if you want. Yeah, probably next time let's do it morning time. What do you mean? For the poor guys on the other side of the world. Okay, the challenges of a global village. Well, thanks, guys. Thank you for having me. See you around. Thanks, Wojciech. Thank you. And that's it. That was another action-packed podcast episode full of really intriguing thoughts and very vibrant discussion on the state of evacuation modeling. I hope you enjoyed that and you've picked some things that are useful for your everyday practice. For myself, some concepts were really interesting to hear them directly from the experts in the field, like the need to replace the fundamental diagrams with something even more fundamental. fundamental diagrams with something even more fundamental. So in a way that you're supplying the data on what your population is in terms of maybe gender, age, background. And then the model should figure out what to do with that data to assess the proper pre-evacuation distribution, proper speed versus density equations and stuff like that. equation distribution, proper speed versus density equations and stuff like that. That's really intriguing because now we are supplying the data directly using one or two relations that are written in the SFP handbook. And maybe that's not the best way, probably the easiest, but maybe not the best one to use in modeling. And the second really interesting thing was when Enrico mentioned two-way coupling between CFD and evacuation modeling. I must say I've never thought about it in this way, that we should probably include in our CFD analysis the effects people have on the state of the building at the moment, in terms of opening doors, windows, moving around, playing with systems. If you think about the most simple pressurization system, the state of its operation will always be dependent on the state of the doors, and the state of the doors will be directly connected to if someone is using them at the moment or not. And that's a really, really powerful thought because when we do analyze the safety of our buildings, we often run these simplistic calculations where actually the calculations are super advanced, but the scenarios are the most simple we can get. We simplify everything. We assume the doors are closed, that no one opens or fills with them. We assume everything works like it should, while in reality, that might not be the case, and you might end up with a completely different scenario, completely different operation of your building, and in consequence, completely different operation of your systems. So if we could include the human behavior in this equation, If we could include the human behavior in this equation in CFD modeling, that actually would be phenomenal. And that could open a whole new world of analysis in which you could truly test if the systems are fail-safe. If there is a single point of failure for a system that makes it useless. Yeah, I think that's like really powerful thought it's it's really resonating with me and because we are preparing a huge round of full-scale corridor smoke control system experiments that i'm gonna tell you more in near future it's something we need to include in our experiments and it's gonna be fantastic so i'm really thankful for enrico to poaching that idea to me a lot of credit goes to him if not all the credit so yeah that's that's something that that's already like blowing up in my mind and and it will change the way how we approach this modeling and experiments and maybe this is something that that starts the new, better future for this field of fire science. I hope it is. Probably I'm exaggerating, but I would really like it to be. So tell me what you took out of this episode. Tell me what you've learned about evacuation modeling and the future of it. Maybe you see a different path for the evacuation modeling in the future. Maybe you have some ideas how to make evacuation modeling better. Please share them with me and with Enrico and with Ruggero. We will very, very appreciate that and we'll try to respond to you. And maybe just like Enrico did, telling me that simple idea, maybe you will also change someone's whole research plan for the better. And yeah, as a final announcement, I would like to say that I was very pleased with how this episode went. And no Italians were harmed by sending them pineapple pizza. They are very safe. Their pizzas are like they're supposed to be without the pineapple on it. And I hope they're very happy. So, yeah, thank you to my Italian guests. This was a fantastic chat with you. I had a great fun. I've learned a lot and the ideas are booming in my head. So what else to expect from a great interview? Thank you so much. And to the listeners, thank you very much for being here.
