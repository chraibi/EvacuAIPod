 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 66. I'm excited today because we're going to talk timber in fire. Let's go. I have invited Professor Andy Buchanan. Andy is with the PLT Structural Consultants, but we all know him from being a professor at Canterbury in New Zealand, Christchurch. And Andy has a lifetime of experience in different aspects of structural engineering with timber. And in the last years, he's turned into timber and fire and mass timber and fire and engineered timber and fire. All the topics that seem to be very important all over the world because of the trends that we get to talk in the episode as well with Andy. The occasion is pretty good because Andy has just created a book that came out with Brigitte Ossmann, Fire Safe Use of Wood in Buildings, Global Design Guide. It's a handbook on different aspects of the use of wood in buildings, in tall buildings. And yeah, you can bet on it. We're absolutely going to talk the book through in this podcast episode but it's obviously it's not a book club podcast we're talking about real engineering and there is a lot of really useful great information in this episode outside of knowing what the book is about and you know what the best thing about this book it's actually free, it's available to download in PDF, well not completely free, someone's available to download in PDF. Well, not completely free. Someone paid for it. That was the authors and sponsors of the book. So huge thank yous to all of people who made this book happen and who made it possible to have it shared as an open source resource. That is absolutely amazing and I wish more of the science was like this. Accessible and open science is something I live and stand for. That's why I'm doing a podcast. That's why I'm sharing all of this with you, because this is the way. This is the way. So on the topic, in the episode you're just going to hear, we're going to have a really nice discussion on different aspects of timber and fire, the role of firefighting operations, how the timber changes the fire environment in the building and why it matters, how we should distinguish between normal, small timber structures and the tallest timber buildings in the world, why there are differences and how should we approach that. I mean, there's so many open topics in this talk. I hope you will enjoy it because it just vastly broadens the horizons in understanding timber and fire. And that's one of the top three topics nowadays. So every fire engineer should be interested because most of us will have to deal with this in one way or another. And before we jump into the episode, I have to warn you for some reason I don't understand, after one year of use, my Microsoft Windows has chosen that my default microphone is not anymore the fancy one I have and used to record all of this, but it's chosen some other random device. So I sound like I am in an aquarium. I was not in an aquarium, I was in my studio. Like I am in an aquarium. I was not in an aquarium. I was in my studio. But Andy is the one you want to listen today. So I hope my unfortunate technical issues do not ruin the experience for you. I'm pretty sure it's going to be okay and you will still enjoy the whole episode. But yeah, I've given the warning and now let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the Firesense Show. I'm today with Professor Andy Buchanan of the University of Canterbury. Hello, Andy. Great to have you in the podcast. Yes, hi, Wojciech. It's a pleasure to be here. Well, I know you're a longtime listener of the podcast. I'm super thankful to you for your feedback, and I'm very happy that finally you're on the other side of the mic. I'm looking forward to this discussion. Well, thank you. And I must say that I look forward to your show every week because I know every week is going to be somebody different. Some of them, some of your guests I know and many I don't know. But it's always a great listen. So I'm pleased to be here. Yeah, let's make together a great experience for anyone listening now. And actually, we have a good topic, the topic that's probably number one topic on my show. It's always fires discussions, and we're going to talk about timber and fire or wood and fire. And we have a very good occasion for that because you have just co-authored a major piece, a book on the fire-safe use of wood in buildings. And we're going to jump into that book just in a second, but I cannot let the opportunity pass. And I must ask you, how the hell fire safety engineering on that level came to life in Canterbury? hell fire safety engineering on that level came to life in Canterbury. I always, like, in my life of engineer, I always looked up to Canterbury, and you guys have been such an amazing place where real fire engineering plays. I mean, many times I've said Harrison Spearpoint's work was the one and only reason I became a scientist, even turning scientist from fire engineer and consultants. I love the school of thought that has been built. So maybe you can tell me how it began. I'm thrilled to learn that. There's some history here because the University of Canterbury is in the city of Christchurch, where I was born, where I am now. And I went to the engineering school here and did structural engineering. And that was mostly earthquake engineering of concrete structures. And with that degree, I then wanted to travel and I headed off overseas. And I went to the University of California at Berkeley to do a master's degree. I thought I would be studying earthquake engineering, but there were two big names there in fire engineering, Brady Williamson and Pat Pagney. And by accident, I bumped into them and they said, have you thought about doing your master's thesis in fire engineering? No, I said, what's that? What's fire engineering? So I did a project. They happened to have a wall furnace there, and it was such a simple experiment now, but we were just measuring the gas flow, how much heat went into the furnace, and it really wasn't structural engineering at all, but it introduced me to fire engineering and from then on I went back to New Zealand I was employed as a structural engineer and I got that's when I got interested in timber buildings and when I went overseas to do my PhD I considered fire engineering but I really wanted to do wood and timber engineering. So I went to the University of British Columbia in Canada, and there was no fire in that. I just did it on the strength of wood and wood structures, went back to New Zealand, had my own consultancy for a while, and then I got invited to join the University of Canterbury in 1987 and at that time I had the opportunity to start teaching a course or two on fire engineering and the coincidence was that just about that time the New Zealand code environment changed completely and a performance based building code was introduced and I was approached by an old friend of mine who was in the fire service, and he said, what's the university going to do with this new performance-based code? And he said, you're going to have to do something. And I said, well, I can't do it myself. We'll need some, we'd have to hire someone. But he said, how much money do you want? We'd have to hire someone. But he said, how much money do you want? And so we ended up getting a grant from the New Zealand Fire Service because we're a small country and we have a national fire service organization, the Fire Service Commission they were called, and they gave us $100,000. It was a lot of money in those days. And then we went hunting for staff. And the first person I contacted was Brady Williamson at Berkeley where I had studied, and he came right back and said, what about Charlie Fleischman? And that's how I met Charlie, and he came for a short stay 30 years ago, and he's still here. Short stay, yes. And I would have to say the strength of the program at Canterbury is collaboration because our engagement with the New Zealand Fire Service has continued to this day. And that one thing built on another. And so now there are five full-time staff in fire engineering. It's gone from one to five, and it's gone from strength to strength. Amazing. I love to hear people's stories, and I need to start doing statistics, like how many people purposefully went into fire science, and how many by accident, and I'm literally worried if I find anyone who just did it purposefully, actually, how life can put you on the very right track. You've mentioned your engineering was also much related to timber, and today we're also in the timber subject. So was timber something that accompanied you through your scientific career, and eventually you've... Let me say this. First of all, I'm a structural engineer. I've always been a structural engineer. And when we started teaching fire engineering at Canterbury, Charlie and then Mike Spearpoint and now many others, we expanded our program to talk about fire safety systems and human behavior in fire, all of those topics. But my area was structural fire engineering. And so if you look at the list of courses at Canterbury, course number 601 is structural fire engineering. And from the course notes of that course, which I taught for many years, I wrote a book on structural design for fire safety and then the first edition was 2001 when we updated that in 2017 I invited Tony Abu to join me he's now a co-author and so he wrote all of the computational part of that and made the book much better so that structural fire engineering was for all materials. And even then in 2001, we didn't see this explosion of timber buildings. But I had studied timber buildings in Canada. And then what has happened now, of course, is that largely because of the climate crisis, there's a huge demand for timber buildings and you've had podcasts on this that everybody is wanting to reduce their carbon footprint they want zero carbon buildings and the only way to make a zero carbon building with zero embodied carbon is to put lots of wood in it and that that is driving a big change. And I'm just lucky because I have a background in structural fire engineering and structural timber. And so since I retired from the university, I've specialized in the fire safety and timber buildings because it's a problem. I mean, as many of your previous speakers have said, in the past, the fire dynamics and the structural behavior are uncoupled. In a steel or concrete building, you can consider them separately. We look at the fire, what kind of fire do we have and what kind of structural performance do we have? But suddenly, if you have a lot of the structure which can burn, then the two are now coupled and it makes life a lot more difficult. Yes, absolutely. I love how you immediately put that perspective in front of the listeners because if you were to, in one sentence, quickly explain what's the difference between all the non-combustible structures we had in the past and why timber is different i think that summarizes it really well that in in one case you can decouple the fire behavior from the structural behavior and to some successful extent study them separately while in timber it is so it's joined on so many levels there are so many feedback loops that you cannot do that anymore or you can but the degree of success will be very very much different because of the simplifications and omissions that's right we end up with them as we end up with the tension because from a carbon point of view, the more wood in the building, the bigger the store of carbon and the more fossil fuel emissions you can offset. But if a building owner is going to spend a lot of money on a building, a timber building, the owner and the architect, they want to see the wood. The more, the better. And the fire engineer then is saying, but wait a minute, we can't expose this wood. We should hide it all. And so if you have a building that many people will know for a while that was the tallest timber building in the world, the Brock Commons building at University of British Columbia, and that was an 18-story timber building. And if you go into that building, you don't see any wood. It's all covered up with layers of gypsum plasterboard so it's what we call encapsulation and so there are lots of tensions here because on the one hand the climate people are happy because they got some wood into that building instead of steel and concrete and the fire people are happy because the wood has been excluded from any possible fire in the building. But we're missing then all the benefits of seeing the wood and feeling the wood and knowing that we're in a timber building. Can't win them all. I also think a big driver, I don't know if it's a big driver, but I have this feeling that tells me it's a big driver. You mentioned the tallest timber building in the world. I see like the tallest, the biggest timber structure in XYZ region, the biggest timber building in Poland, in Sweden. Everyone wants to have, I don't know if you can put it on your wall, a diploma. I feel the biggest timber structure in blank. I find that in a way ridiculous because it's so egocentric to push technology maybe for the sake of your own building of a company. I don't know if that is a factor, but it feels like a factor. Let me comment on that. I agree entirely. A lot of people will ask me, how tall can we go? How tall can it be? And I'm saying, well, of course, a few years ago, there was a kind of design competition to make the Empire State Building do a design in timber. And it can be done. Of course it can be done. But the market for it, if we want to have a lot of wood and a lot of buildings to store a lot of carbon, it shouldn't be a competition for the highest. It should be the run-of-the-mill apartment buildings, commercial office buildings, two-, four-, six-, eight-storey buildings where there's a large volume, and that's really where I see the market should be. And we can make those buildings just as safe as a steel or concrete building. But when we start getting very tall buildings, very tall timber buildings, there is a threat there which I'm nervous about because there's still unanswered questions about what happens to the exposed wood at the end of a major fire. Let me just say a few more words. You see, in this design guide that we just published, fire safe use of wood in buildings, with 20 authors from 12 different countries, we had a kind of expression in there. A lot of the authors were talking about self-extinguishment, and we had this kind of discussion. What does self-extinguishment mean? Well, if you're lucky, you have a fire in a wooden building, the fire will go out. But only if you're lucky, only under certain circumstances. So in the end, we took the words out of the book. Self-extinguishment doesn't appear there anymore. We talk about burnout, but what we admit in this book is that if you have a major fire in a mass timber building, when the fire dies down and firefighters can get in there, they're going to have to go around and hose the building and make sure that the charring has stopped, because it won't stop by itself. And that there presents a danger, which is not a problem for small and medium-sized buildings, but it could be a problem for a very tall building. I had this conversation with Mike's viewpoint at some point when we were doing our experiments for all of our structural team alliance. And these are long experiments and through the middle of it nothing is happening, so it's filled with nice discussions. And I guess you can imagine you can talk to Mike for quite a long period of time without being bored. So we had this one discussion, how do we define burnout? And a thing that came to my mind is, burnout is burnout. It's like quite a self-evident thing. The moment you start to define the criteria criteria when it has been achieved and where it did not achieve, you start to water it down. Do we agree on this temperature? It has burnt out or not? I mean, burnout is burnt out. In a way, somewhat ridiculous that we need to alter a definition or find a new definition for something self-evident just so another thing can fit into the definition where it obviously can like if you leave a timber structure with complex shapes not extinguished like majority of it will self-extinguish or will stop flaming eventually it will stop smoldering as well it will stop oxidizing as well. But wherever you have a complicated shape, you know, connection between column beam and wall and ceiling, concealed space, something like a box where heat is trapped and radiation can occur, and a little more complicated shape, it's quite evident it will not go out on its own you have to put water on it like you mentioned you have to extinguish it and this is a a major difference in the introduction to to your book fire safe use of wood in buildings global design guidance let's highlight the big get islam as the co-author of this fantastic book. In the introduction, I think it was Craig Baylor who wrote that, one of the achievements of this book is the recognition of being cognizant about firefighting is a factor in timber buildings. And I always thought that we lack perspective of a firefighter as fire engineers. And I also feel the role of firefighting to some extent is more important in mass timber structures or large timber structures than, let's say, in contemporary non-combustible buildings. What are your feelings when you've introduced such a chapter into your book? Well, thank you for that question. Before I answer the question, I'm just going to do a little plug for this book because a lot of people won't know about it, and I'll come on to that question because this book is – I didn't write the book. I'm an editor of the book, although I wrote one chapter. There are 14 made chapters in the book and each one has a different author and they're all over the world. And so we've got, for example, the book starts with Christian Degenees from Canada talking about timber structures and wooden buildings. Colleen Wade talks about biodynamics, which is a summary of all the latest research on fire behavior in buildings with exposed wood. Birgit Ostman has a chapter on fire safety requirements in different regions, and she's got maps of the world showing the different requirements for different... That was very interesting, very, very interesting, yeah. Because the rules are very different in different countries. The fire behaves the same way, but the rules are different. Yeah. And then Mark Janssens from San Antonio Southwest Research Institute has written a chapter on reaction to fire performance, which is all about bone calorimeter, single burning item test, all those tests. Norman Werther from Munich has written on fire separating assemblies and all the different ways there are to assess by test or by calculation the performance of walls and floors. And Ella Just from Estonia has written a chapter on load-bearing timber structures, which is largely based on the new draft of Eurocode 5, which won't be published for a little while yet, but if you want to get a sneak preview of Eurocode 5, that's in there. And then David Barber from Arup Fire, who spends his time moving between Washington, D.C. and Melbourne, he wrote the chapter on timber connections. And I always remind people, when you compare a wooden building, a timber building, with steel or concrete, just think about the difference. Concrete is a liquid, and you can pour it into any shape. Steel is a wonderful material. You can weld it. You can weld the bits into any shape. But a timber building, you cannot do either of those. And much of the design effort in a timber building is coming up with connections, a way of connecting the bits together with bolts and nails and screws and brackets. And the fire performance of those is an issue which David has covered in Chapter 8. And then Esko Mikkola from VTT in Finland has written a chapter on preventing fire spread within structures. Birgit Ostman has talked about sprinklers, and we can talk about sprinklers because they're so important. talked about sprinklers and we can talk about sprinklers because they're so important. And then we've got a chapter on performance-based design and risk assessment, which is just an overview written by Paul England in Australia. And then robustness in fire, which is structural robustness. How do you avoid disproportionate collapse if one column fails? And El Tlipil from ETH in Zurich has written that chapter with other authors. And then the last two chapters are very important and they're a bit different from the others. So chapter 13 is written by Andrew Dunn in Australia and I just give some credit to Andrew because he was really it was his idea to produce this book, to write it in the first place. And he's written a chapter which is mostly about avoiding fires during construction. And last of all, Chapter 14 is Firefighting Considerations. And that's written by Ed Claridge from Auckland Council here in New Zealand, and he's looking at what firefighters need to think about and what information the fire engineer can provide to provide some comfort to firefighters to show that they've thought about what kind of fires would occur and identifying all of the concerns of the firefighters about hidden spaces and voids and firefighter access and exposed timber structures and other things. For example, the influence of wind on fire intensity. And most important of all is planning, pre-incident planning, and for the fire service to be involved during the design and construction of the building so that they know the building. I'm not a firefighter, but firefighters, I know the most important thing for them is to understand the building and how the building might work. So that was a very long answer to a short question, but I think maybe it answers that question about firefighting in timber buildings, because it is so important. Yeah, thank you for answering that, and thank you for giving an overview of the book. It really is a collection of great mindsets and great chapters, giving quite a complete image on the subject. So I would highly recommend this read to anyone, especially that it is widely available in open access. I wanted to just take one more peek into the firefighting. I wanted to know your opinion. You're now out of university. You're a consultant in PPL structural consultants. And is this firefighting considerations something you actually do consider in your design? You have a framework to do that, or is this just something you have in the back of your head when you are advising in the design of a structure? No, the answer to that is that this is going to vary in different countries. In New Zealand, the fire engineers are not thinking about the firefighter considerations all the time. But we have within the New Zealand Fire Service, they have a responsibility. They have, for major buildings, they have a kind of a power of veto where they get to look at the fire engineering brief. That's normally what's done at the early stages, even before the design, before the detailed design, there's a fire engineering brief, which is prepared by the fire engineer in collaboration with the building owner and the architect. And it's discussed with the fire and emergency department. And so if they have concerns, they will address them. So let me just tell you something that's happened in New Zealand. This is a worldwide problem, but one of the perceived problems with timber buildings is if you have exposed floors and you have a poor glue line, there's a possibility of a layer falling off or having char fall off, which exposes a new layer, and so the fire never goes out. And so Fire and Emergency New Zealand are aware of this, and it depends on the building. But if you have a building, we're designing a building now which is a care facility for elderly people who are bedridden. And the fire service is saying, how are you going to ensure that we get burnout and we don't have any falling off of this hot layer? And the answer is, so what the fire engineers do then is that when they do their fire severity calculations, When they do their fire severity calculations, they're using a method developed by Daniel Brandon, who's been on your show, who's done lots of burnout tests on CLT compartments. And what tends to be happening now with these buildings is that in a CLT building, I'm talking about a building with lots of walls and lots of floors, and they're all made of solid wood. The walls are generally covered with plasterboard because that's what the architect wants, that there's an advantage for the acoustics between rooms, and it provides a cavity for transmitted surfaces, but the ceilings are exposed wood. And what the fire engineers then do, they use the design method from Daniel Brandon, which is spelled out in Chapter 3 of this book, and find out what duration of the fire is and keep it. And sometimes what happens is that if the fire duration is too long or the equivalent fire severity is too great, then the fire engineer goes to the architect and says, you've got to put more windows in this building. Why more windows? Because we want more ventilation, so we have a short, sharp fire and the fire goes up. The architect says, we can't put more windows in. This is all fixed. Okay, then we'll have to cover up some of the ceiling. We'll encapsulate it so that we reduce the amount of wood which can be involved in the fire. And so at the same time, the output of Daniel Brandon's calculation method is the depth of charring, and we want to make sure that that depth of charring doesn't get to the first glue line. So that's, again, a long answer to a short question, but there's a lot of backwards and forwards here about the technique for doing it is described in this new book. So I hope that'll be helpful to people who are moving in this direction. Absolutely. The fact that you have provided a tool set or just a tool for engineers to use through the book is of immense value. And when we were chatting before that, you also said that that was a point to do because you're an engineer. You like tools to work with and you like to give tools to people. In the book, in some places, you can see the importance of wind is also being brought, and in a way, it also connects to the importance of window fallout and window damage. And then that, again, brings us to the complexity of compartment fires and the relation between the fuel, the structure, the outside, the inside, the window, the flow paths. I found it really interesting because it's not something we often consider that much when doing even experiments. You know, a typical way to do a fire experiment with timber is just build a hell of a lot of openings that represent the most critical opening factor or the worst, biggest opening factor you can have in the building. Just have them open from time zero because you don't want to build expensive windows in a fire experiment that is just about to be burned down. And we simulate the fires like that. Whereas if you have smaller windows, fire costs will be completely different. If you have wind, the course of the fire may be completely different. Maybe you'd like to comment on that aspect, how it goes into the whole fire safe use of water. Look, absolutely. And this is a big problem for structural engineers doing fire safety of any building, but it's more difficult for the timber building. But, I mean, if you just think about the starting point for structural fire engineering, if an engineer has a steel structure or a concrete structure, the question is to the fire engineer, well, how hot is it going to get? How hot is my steel going to get? And that's all the structural engineer wants to know. And because we can calculate a limiting temperature, and as long as it doesn't reach the limiting temperature, then the structure will remain standing. Or if it's a concrete structure, what is the temperature of the reinforcing steel, which is buried a few centimeters inside the concrete. And the traditional way of doing this is to use like what we call a parametric fire from Eurocode. That's what most people use. And all we need to know is the fuel load, the ventilation, and the thermal properties of the fire compartment. And, of course, there are lots of uncertainties in there because we don't know what the fuel load is, we're guessing. There have been surveys of fuel load, but in New Zealand we have very low fuel loads in our building code, which we're a bit worried about because for a residential occupancy, which is regarded as a low fire load, we use 400 megajoules a square metre. And then if we put a sprinkler system into the building, our building code says that, well, to take account of the reduced probability of the fire, you can cut the fuel load in half. So we drop from 400 to 200 megajoules a square metre. And that is a very low number. So I'm worried about that. And then you've got the thermal properties of the compartment, which are much more easily addressed. And finally, you've got this question of the windows. And in the old days, when we had single glazing of plain glass everywhere, we could assume the windows would break. But nowadays, we have double glass, triple glass, and you've had a podcast on this. We have tempered glass. We have reinforced glass. And the way I look at it is that if none of the windows break, first of all, if we have a fire and the sprinklers don't work for some reason, that's the worst-case scenario. But if none of the windows break, the fire will go out. We don't need any fire resistance because we don't have a proper fire. If all the windows break, bang, bang, bang, a flashover, forced by and resulting in flashover, then we have a short, sharp fire, 1,000 degrees for 10, 15 minutes, and the fire will die down and go out. And we'll have what we call burnout. It won't self-extinguish, but the temperatures will drop. But if only half the windows break, then we've got something in between, which is a fire that may not burn for 20 minutes, but it may burn for an hour or more. And the question then is, do we have to consider the worst possibility of all of these variables? And if we do, we won't be able to build the building. It's like, if this was an airplane, it wouldn't fly if we took all the worst case of all the variables. So there's a lot of engineering judgment in here. And some of this is fire engineers will say, well, I just do what the code says. But most building codes weren't written in the days of mass timber buildings. So we have still a lot of questions to answer. And this book of ours doesn't give all the answers, but at least it provides the background information for people to make a considered judgment. I'm talking too long now, Oce. to make a considered judgment. I'm talking too long now, Oce, but there's a lot to hear. There's a point of having a podcast made. If you did not, I would not invite you here. That's good. In your chapter, the one that you've authored, in the end, there's future research needs. In fact, the first out of them is fire severity in compartments with exposed timber surfaces, including traveling fires. So you really think it's the number one unknown we have or number one need, how compartment fires change when we introduce exposed timber. I know there has been, like, I feel we're living in some golden era of fire testing mass timber. There's a lot of large-scale experiments being carried all over the planet. I would assume it is because of what you mentioned in the beginning of the episode. It's a very fancy technology that fits into current politics of reducing carbon footprint and so on. So it's trendy in a way. If a structure can be trendy, it is. And this brings a lot of experiments. Most of them are carried in the same way, but there are few really interesting ones, like the one performed in France, Code Red. I don't know if you've seen it, where they did CLT sealing over, let's say, traditional traveling fire experiment setup, and it completely changed the fire dynamics. It does not answer questions yet, but it shows the answers may be interesting. I mean, it changed the dynamic a lot. Yes, of course. And, I mean, the history of dynamic a lot. Yes, of course. And I mean, the history of this over the last 10 years or so is that we used to think that all we needed was a standard fire resistance test, and that would tell us the way the material behaved in a fire. But as you know, the fire resistance test is not a real fire test. It's just a method of comparing one product with another. And it was really mass timber materials, cross-laminated timber, CLT, was developed in Europe and invented in Europe. And it was really when North Americans wanted to start using this and the fire brigades in North America started asking questions and the manufacturers said, that's not a problem. We've got a 60-minute, 90-minute fire resistance rating. And, well, why don't we just do a room fire to see how it behaves? And that's when they started doing these room fires. And they found that the room fire was completely different from the fire resistance test and that's really led to a lot of changes, changes in the adhesive and changes in understanding about how the fire behaved. More recently there have been some large fire tests and there are more coming. The Australians are planning a large 20 metre square fire compartment with looking at the effect of ventilation on the fire and that'll be very exciting if that happens. But the next question really is if we have too much wood exposed, well then we'll have to start covering it up. And if you look at Chapter 7 in this guide, which is the Eurocode requirements for structural timber, what we need to know now for our protective materials, gypsum plasterboard, we need to know the time at which the charring will start underneath the plasterboard and the rate of charring there, which will be less than the normal charring rate and then the time to the fall off of the gypsum plasterboard and the charring rate after the fall off which will which is by seen in experiments to be about twice the standard charring rate and so now there's a hot new demand on manufacturers of protective materials asking them to provide this information they never got asked us before what time does charring start under your board? And at what time would your board fall off? And if charring is starting in under the board, well, that's more fuel for the fire. It has to be added to the fire load that we started with. And so all of this is difficult enough in a small compartment like an apartment building or a single office. But we still haven't got the answers as to how this encapsulation is going to, for how long will it protect the wood in a larger space where we might have a traveling fire. Lots of questions. Exactly as we speak now, there is an experiment happening at ITB lab where they're looking into the failure of some protection bolts on CLT to investigate like what state is the protection after the fire resistance period and to indicate what is the failure mechanism of the encapsulation. Because it's not only related to charring, but you can reignite. I have witnessed myself this mythical second flashover, and the third one and the fourth one in one compartment, and it is somewhat scary. It's a behavior you... Like, if you have a steel beam protected with some boards, and they fall off after 90 minutes, when the fire is in its decay phase, a steel beam protected with some boards, and they fall off after 90 minutes, when the fire is in its decay phase, and the temperatures are inevitably going down, it may take a long time to cool down, but they're not rising anymore. It's something you can handle as a structural engineer. But if your failure creates a re-ignition, another some sort of flashover, even flaming combustion, and your temperatures start to rise again, you're experiencing the 90th minute of when your furnace is turned off. It's not that polite. In your answer, you've also mentioned sprinklers. When your sprinklers fail, we have a problem. Can we consider that if they don't fail, we don't have a problem? What's your opinion on that? Yes, yes. Look, let me just reinforce what you've just been saying. Okay. There is really some people in the timber industry, sometimes they ask me, whose side are you on? I thought you were trying to promote timber buildings. And I am. And there are lots of reasons for promoting timber buildings, and we have to do it. But some of these questions are real questions, and I think that it boils down to risk. It's a risk assessment, and we can handle the risk as long as we're not building skyscrapers. If we're building modest-sized buildings where people can get out and fire service have good access, then we can control these things and we control it. For tall buildings, all the tall buildings are going to have sprinklers. And then this raises another question because sprinklers are fantastic. Sprinklers are far and away the best form of fire protection. There's no question about that. But there is a small possibility, a small probability that sprinklers won't control the fire. And that's been demonstrated. But why? Because the sprinklers were down for maintenance or because there's an explosion somewhere or if it's in a war zone or an earthquake which takes out the water supply. It's a very low probability, but it's a low – this event of a fire in a building where the sprinklers don't control the fire, it's a very low probability, but it's a very high consequence. And so that can only be addressed by doing some sort of quantitative risk assessment. Paul England has, in Chapter 12 of this book on performance-based design, has set out the framework for doing that. But it's not the sort of tool that can be done every day in the design office. It's the sort of thing that has to be done by the code writers and the people informing the code writers. And what it means is that as the timber buildings get large and tall and complex, then there have to be larger safety factors and a larger level of protection to mitigate the risk. I think the low probability is in a way subjective. Because if I think low probability myself being mostly involved in tunnels, I would think like 10 to minus 5 probability. myself being mostly involved in tunnels, I would think like 10 to minus 5 probability. And when you talk about sprinkler reliability, I mean, 5%, 1% in reliability. You could consider that low from one point of view, but like 5% chance to have fire that significantly damages your building and completely changes the battlefield for the firefighter, that is a high probability. It's not something you can go on and say, ah, it's a special probability, we don't include that in our considerations. I like how you said that it may not be necessarily the role of the building engineer to calculate this risk for their own structure, but it should be something that comes from above, that is fit within the idea of a certain country, region, government, on what fire safety they want to provide and how they want to provide it. I like this approach a lot. But it's very difficult. Let me just explain another kind of issue here, because if the fire regulations are very restrictive and we do some risk assessment to relax them a little bit, well, everybody's happy because we can make that work as long as we can demonstrate it. problem in New Zealand which is opposite because our fire resistance ratings which were decided by some committee 20 years ago are very low and there is no restrictions on using wood in a 20-story building. You can use as much as you like and the issues that we're talking about they don't appear in the building code and so what we're telling the code authorities is well we'll have to have to put some guidance in here or some restrictions on the use of wood. But if you make the building code a little tougher than it was before, then suddenly you have a problem because all the owners of existing buildings say, what do you mean my building's not safe anymore? And the fire engineers resist it because then it would look as if they've been designing unsafe buildings. And so that's it. I hate it when it comes to that. I absolutely hate it because you're putting people into shame, guilt, or justify against a beneficial change for the society. And the same goes the other way. Like, we've always done like that, and it has been always good. I mean, that does not mean you should not change the way of thinking and seek possibly better solutions. It's all very difficult, because when you say we've always done like that, but we haven't, we have not always had mass timber buildings. These are new, and the game is changing. And as long as we do it properly, we can make these buildings, say, for steel or concrete buildings, but it may require some changes to the building codes. I mean, as you know, most countries, we have two possible approaches. We have the kind of prescriptive code, the cookbook, the rules of thumb, where you just tick the boxes. And the alternative approach is a performance-based building code with a verification, a calculation method. And in both cases, we're in discussion now with the New Zealand code authorities and saying, really, if we're going to start looking at tall timber buildings, we'll have to look at both lots of regulations just to make sure that we're consistent with the expected levels of safety and with what people are doing elsewhere in the world. But do you explicitly know them, the expected levels of safety? No, we don't know them. We do not know them. I think structural engineers know enough about, well, let me put it this way. In structural engineering, there are not so many uncertainties as there are in fire engineering. In structural engineering, of course, there are uncertainties about the strength of the material and there are uncertainties about the loads that might be applied from wind or snow or earthquake. applied from wind or snow or earthquake. And so it's not so difficult to do a risk assessment. But if we're designing this building then for a fire where we don't know the fire load in the building, we don't know the use of the building, we don't know how it's changed, we don't know whether the windows will break, and we don't know whether there'll be fire in more than one floor or more. I mean, there's a huge number of variables. And I guess that goes back to the discussion you had with Mike Spearpoint in a previous show where you were talking to Mike about the consistent level of crudeness, which is an expression which I have used a lot. I got the expression from David Elms at the University of Canada. Mike, same thing got it from you. Mike says he got it from you. Yes, he got it from me. But David Elms taught me structural engineering at the University of Canterbury about 50 years ago, and he's a neighbor of mine. He's the live and well, and he still is a great fan of this because if you're doing your CFD model of predicting the behavior of a fire in a compartment, you have a model for, and if you include a model for window breakage, which you've talked about, and you have a very precise model and you can calculate an answer plus or minus 1%, but if the input to that model is completely unknown, then your level of crudeness is no longer consistent, and there's no point in doing a very precise calculation unless you know the input. And I think this is a problem that we have in the fire engineering community because fires don't happen very often, and when they do happen, they're always very different from what we expected. And so we've got to be very careful about predicting behavior of something to a high degree of accuracy when we really don't know what's going to happen. And for that reason, we've got to have a certain level of safety, and that's got to be related to the people and property which are exposed to the fire. My mentor, Professor Janeski, always said, you want to be roughly correct or wrong but with great precision. And that's also something that goes to your level of goodness. I love this way of thinking. I like that. What did you say? The answer is either roughly correct. The answer is you're roughly correct or precisely wrong. That's right. Roughly correct or precisely wrong. I really enjoyed that. Andy, an hour has passed, and it's fantastic to talk to you. And we've touched the tip of the iceberg of the subjects that you've covered, that are covered in your book, and the subjects that would be possibly interesting to talk outside of the book. I still have not talked on the podcast about the risks to whole regions. Like, are we going into the age of urban configurations if we start building mass timber again. That's something that's interesting to me. In your challenges, you've mentioned facades. That's a hell of a problem. That is a hell of a problem. How do we deal with facades in timber buildings and how they contribute to spread or not contribute to spread? I love that. You've mentioned smoldering, which is an interesting problem as well, because the fact you've extinguished your fire and it looks not burning doesn't mean that it's not disappearing. You go for an hour and come back in an hour and the column is suddenly 10 centimeters thinner than it has been. Those are just slow processes that are occurring with your biological material that is being still oxidized and decomposed. So there's so much more to uncover in the world. Maybe I should make it. It's a timber podcast. I don't know. It's a popular subject. But anyway, we are not able to cover it, but we are able to send people to pick up the Fire Safe Use of Wood in Buildings book and dig into that because they will find a lot of answers. So where people can get it. Well, just let me say that this book has just been published. It's a hardback book, but because the authors were so keen to make sure this book gets read is that we did a deal with the publisher and the publisher was called Taylor and Francis. We did a deal with the publisher and we the publisher was called taylor and francis we did a deal with them and we paid them some money and we collected that money from different countries and we paid them some money and so this for a change this book is a free download anybody can get it and so i'll give you the address and put it on the website but even if you google fire safe use of wood and you'll find the free download from Taylor and Francis. It costs you nothing. And you can download a PDF version of this book anywhere in the world. And that was really the people, the authors who wrote this book said we're not going to do this unless anyone can read it. So have a look at it. Get into it. And if you've got any questions, you can ask any of the authors for guidance. That's it. And the beautiful looking hard copy is also available through CRC Press, wherever you order scientific books, I guess. You showed it to me, it looks beautiful. I would like one on my shelf. Well, you can get it from Amazon or wherever you get books from. Fantastic. Andy, thank you so much for being a friend of the podcast. Thank you so much for taking your time to edit such an important book. And your book on fire resistance is also an important piece that should be in many engineers' libraries. So the 2017 edition with Tony Averill is absolutely great. And I know a lot of engineers are using that. And thank you for your time today to talk about the important topic of safe use of wooden buildings. Well, thank you. It was a huge pleasure. It was my pleasure, and I look forward to hearing more, a few different topics next week. Thank you very much. Thanks, man. And that's it. Such a joy to talk to Andy. I know he's a big fan of the podcast. Andy, I'm a big fan of you. It was such a pleasure to discuss timber with you. From this talk, one takeaway for myself, something that was said along the lines of the show, is it seems we have like two different regimes of the problem of timber in buildings. Like there's a hell of a lot of buildings that do not pose any significant threat when you introduce timber into them. What Andy said, the run-of-the-mill buildings, small apartment buildings, small office buildings, ones in which you would encapsulate walls, leave the ceilings exposed, ones that have very good firefighter access from all directions. I mean, in these buildings, you can really bring the risk to the very same level you would encounter in, let's say, concrete or steel or masonry building. You really do not have a significant difference because you have used timber in it. And I think it is important to highlight that there is a regime of buildings that we really should not have a big problem with. I think it's possible to engineer them with the knowledge we have today. And with the knowledge that we'll have in like five years when all the projects are ongoing, we'll finish and publish and all of the knowledge produced will be digested. and all of the knowledge produced will be digested, I'm pretty sure we're going to have very safe frameworks to work with timber in standard buildings. And that's a future to look for because that's where the carbon sink goes. The carbon sink goes in the volume, not in the prestige. And yeah, that's a great future for the timber industry, and that's a great future for fire engineering. Now, the second regime, that's challenging. That's, you know, the next tallest timber building, the next biggest timber building in wherever you are located. And these are not typical structures. These bring challenges that are truly unique to these types of structures. And I feel that discussion is somehow dominated by these types of structures. Even in my podcast, I must say I'm biased towards the tall buildings. I'm in a cost group where we talk about tall timber buildings. We don't talk about small timber buildings. We talk about tall ones. So there definitely is a different sort of threat, a different set of issues, the different set of challenges and risks involved in tall timber buildings, which will be much more difficult to solve than the ones that are related to small buildings, where most of them probably solved already. So here, topics of sprinkler reliability, the wind effects, the firefighters' access, self-extinguishment, burnouts, smoldering fires, facades, all of these are topics to still be fully understood and answered before we can just routinely go and build the next biggest timber building of the world, if we ever will be able to do that routinely. So, yeah, a hell of fire engineering that's required in these projects, and I hope that we will learn to distinguish these projects between each other because now I feel they're in the same bucket and they should not be. We should understand that at some point we consider a low-risk building and at some point we consider a high-threat building. And they should be given a completely different set of approaches, set of people, set of engineering rules, and set of tools used to design them. So, yeah, that's it for the episode. That's my takeaway. Your takeaway should be the book because, as I mentioned, it's free. You can download it from the link in the episode, and I guess the authors will appreciate if you post it as a hard copy and it looks beautiful on your library. So definitely a nice book to have. people on your library. So definitely a nice book to have. Thank you once again, Andy, for publishing this piece and joining me in the episode. Thank you, dear listener, for being here with me. And see you around next Wednesday. Thank you. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
