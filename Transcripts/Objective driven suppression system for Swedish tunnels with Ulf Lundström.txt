 Hello everybody and welcome to session 90 of the Fire Science Show. Today I'm going to venture into the world of sprinklers, or actually my today's guest has done a lot of effort to not call them sprinklers. So let's say today we're venturing into the world of water-fixed firefighting systems and into tunnels. And the guest is Ulf Lundström from Swedish Road Administration. You may wonder why I'm having a Swedish Road Administrator in the podcast, but that's a very good reason. Road administration is a client, is a company that is building roads and tunnels in Sweden. And for some reasons that are mentioned in the podcast, they figured out, okay, we need some fixed firefighting systems in their tunnels. But they did not really like the state of the sprinkler market at the time. like the state of the sprinkler market at the time and decided that instead of purchasing a solution that exists and for or following a code that exists already they will just base on their needs and base on their capabilities like what water is available how they can install them and so on based on those they will just build their own device that's the most sprinkler-ish thing I can think of doing, designing a fixed firefighting system to your own exactly known need and possibilities. It's amazing. And it's interesting both for if you're dealing with sprinklers, well, actually, you may be a little angry because they did not go by the code for sure. But that's also kind of liberating in a way that they have defined a system for their needs, not caring about anyone's opinion that it cannot be done. They've just did it and they are very happy with it and the system works. So what else do you need? Sounds like a really good investment if you're an investor. So that's it for today's episode. And I just wanted to quickly tease one more thing that's coming up this week. On Friday, I will publish an additional episode. Let's call it Q&A. This time, it's me being questioned by Professor Arnold Dix. It's a very non-fire science episode because we're going to talk about what happened in Poland after aggression on Ukraine. And I'm going to show you some of my own experiences and try to tell you how the situation looked in Poland for the last year. A lot of you are interested in what's happening in Ukraine. It's a mess that the war is still going for a year and I guess that's my chance to share some stuff from the heart in the podcast. So if you're interested in that, please check it out. It should publish on Friday. But please don't expect any fire science in that. You will not find it there. Anyway, let's go back to the fire science. Let's go back to the episode with Ulf Lundström. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I will be your host. Hey, so you know I can make this show thanks to the great support I'm receiving from my main sponsor this year, OFR Consultants. If you have not met them yet, OFR Consultants are a multi-award winning independent consultancy dedicated to addressing fire safety challenges. OFR is the UK's leading fire risk consultancy, and its established team has developed a reputation for preeminent fire engineering expertise with colleagues working across the world to help protect people, property, and planet. Internationally, its work ranges from Antarctic to Atacama Desert in Chile. And you know what? I was actually very curious, what are they doing in Atacama Desert in Chile? And as an amateur astrophotographer photographer myself my gut feeling was correct they are dealing with a very large telescope actually it's called the extremely large telescope observatory for the european organization for astronomical research wow that's one project i would like to eventually be involved in if this work sounds like something you would also like to do ofr is keen to hear from industrial professionals who would like to work on the fire safety features this year, get in touch at OFRconsultants.com. And now back to the episode with Ulf Lundström. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Fire Science Show. Today, I'm with Ulf Lundström from the Swedish Road Administration. Hey, Ulf. Hello. Nice to meet you. And I got a person from Road Administration, but let that not confuse you as Ulf is a very good fire safety expert and someone responsible for introducing sprinklers into a bunch of Swedish tunnels. This topic was sold to me by saying that the Swedish tunnels have made a 180 degree turn in terms of the safety concepts through introduction of fixed firefighting systems. So I would love to start the discussion with the starting point of this 180 degree turn. Like what was before the era of fixed firefighting systems in Sweden? What was the environment looking like before you thought that we really need to introduce sprinters into our tunnels? In Sweden, we were building a few quite large urban tunnels with quite a lot of traffic. And the general concept is to build longitudinal ventilated tunnels and no fixed firefighting systems, Longitudinal ventilated tunnels and no fixed firefighting systems because at the time it was regarded as even dangerous and unnecessary. So we built two large tunnels, one in Gothenburg and one in Stockholm. Especially the one in Stockholm turned out to be a problem. It was the Southern Link Tunnel. It's three kilometers from one end to another. In all, it's 15 kilometers of tunnel tubes in it. And we reached about 100,000 vehicles per day in the tunnel. And that means it got quite congested and the traffic was moving very slow. And since we had a longitudinal ventilated system, it meant if we had a fire, And since we had a longitudinal ventilated system, it meant if we had a fire, we risked that the cars would get trapped in the smoke downstream from the fire. Especially if we have a heavy goods vehicle that's on fire. This is a tunnel that is bypassing the city. How is it located? Yeah, it's under the southern parts of Stockholm. So it's part of an imaginary ring road that yet has to be completed. But it's the first leg of the ring road. Okay. So it opened for traffic in 2004. When you were designing this tunnel, you have not considered such a big traffic in it? Not quite as big. And the knowledge in Sweden wasn't very big in tunnel safety issues. So we more or less relied on international expertise. So we built the tunnel like it's built everywhere else in the world. But it turned out not to be very good in our traffic environment. Or perhaps we had a fire brigade that was a bit more agile than other parts of the world. And did you at that point consider the congestion in the tunnel, or you thought it's going to be fluid traffic? It was said it would be free-flowing traffic, but I don't think anyone really believed that, considering what the traffic situation in Stockholm were at the time. What we do now is we actually have to close the tunnel down for safety reasons when there are too much traffic on the road network around the tunnel. So that means it's closed down a few times every week. And that is very annoying for the motorists using it for the commuting to the work. So it's a big problem. I can imagine the users of the tunnel be very happy to find out a tunnel with 100,000 vehicle traffic is being closed. That must be very difficult. So let's check. You said it was designed for longitudinal ventilation. 2004, what kind of design file have you used? Were you already in the 100 megawatt regime? Yeah, it was 100 megawatt. Okay, so let's say you had a modern ventilation system in it. Why haven't you considered sprinklers as a safety measure at the design stage? It was considered not only by the Swedish road authorities, but by expertise in general in Europe, that it was not a sufficient measure for a road tunnel. It was regarded as unnecessary or even dangerous. Okay. Because you know, you've got turbulence in the smoke layers, so you disturb visibility. You mix it. Yeah. it yeah okay yeah and there was some very strange old tests that had been done where you managed to boil pigs by the steam dead pigs i should say but by the steam from from a sprinkler in in a closed environment so it was said that you oh you you will burn all the evacuants by the steam, but that's absolutely not true. You reduce the temperature. 20 years later, I still hear some of these rumors when discussing that by evaporating, it's going to take all the oxygen away from the air and things, or that the visibility will drop so low you will not be able to see. I usually responded I would like to not see and be wet rather than that from radiation. But if I had the choice, I would choose that. Anyway, it's a system that you can use. So it was considered technically unfeasible, and most likely it was also considered expensive at that point, right? Yeah, certainly. The installation costs and the cost for maintenance was a very big issue. So that meant that we had to look at ways to reduce the costs and use the maintenance to get any kind of acceptance for this type of system in the Swedish road authorities. So I assume now comes your 180 degree turn where you've decided that you are unhappy with the state of the tunnel, that you would like to increase the safety. And because you already have state-of-the-art smoke control, not much that can be done to improve that other than installing a fixed firefighting system. So that was in the next big tunnel project in Stockholm, the next part of the ring road in the Northern Link. Okay. So that was around 2009. Then the leading politicians in Stockholm said, we are not going to build this tunnel the same way as the Southern Link, because we can't accept having a tunnel that's getting shut down. And that was in a very late stage of the tunnel project. The tunnel was already more or less built, so it was supposed to be open within five years. So we had to change the safety concept in a very late stage. So we looked at it in many different ways. If you could regulate the traffic so that you could get the cars to leave the tunnel in case of a fire, or if you could increase the detection system's capacity so you can detect the fire quicker. But we never got to a real robust safety concept with these measurements. So finally, we started to discuss fixed firefighting systems. It sounds like you were trying everything but sprinklers. Yeah, certainly. Because sprinkler, that was a dirty word at that time. We don't use that word in tunnels, right? Exactly. So I assume you have not went to the nearest sprinkler shop to purchase sprinklers. As I've read some of your materials, it seems that you went quite a turbulent road by figuring out the solution. Yes, turbulent or a very easy road. It depends on how you look at it. Because, as I said, the sprinkler systems or the fixed firefighting systems that were on the market around 2010, they were dismissed already. They were regarded as not sufficient to be in a Swedish tunnel. So we had to come up with something new to get acceptance. So we looked at what the tunnel itself looked like. We already had water system installed, the fire hydrants for the fire brigade, and there was quite a lot of water that could be delivered in them. So we got the possibility to just make something very simple, some kind of IKEA system, just to spray water directly from the hydrants out in the tunnel. And by then, we didn't look so much at the sprinkler regulations. We just looked what was physically possible in the tunnel. What could we do to achieve such a robust and efficient system, cost-efficient system as possible? First, we decided what do we want to build and looked at that, and especially how much water do we have and how can we distribute that in an efficient way over the tunnel. And then we started to look, all right, what does the sprinkler regulation say about this? When we saw, no, we can't build a sprinkler like this. So then we had a choice. All right, forget the whole thing, or we can forget the sprinkler regulations. And we chose to not call it a sprinkler. We just call it device to spray water in case of a fire. I hope my listeners from the sprinkler industry have not died of a heart attack after this last sentence. from the sprinkler industry have not died of a heart attack after this last sentence. I find it very uncommon to go and do a solution that essentially is a sprinkler system, not following the guidelines. You know, sprinklers is a part of fire engineering that maybe even the first active system ever that originates 150 years ago, you know, it was all built in experimental setting by burning and proving that something works and then codifying it, you know, building codes and standards that regulate the whole thing up to the tiniest details of mounting and everything. Yeah. And perhaps there is the problem. It's difficult to adapt the technology to a new environment. Exactly. So we thought that when we looked at the needs for our road tunnels, the sprinkler regulations wasn't really up to date. They need to be developed. I think perhaps you even went into more, how to say it, origin way of designing Sprinters, you know, trial by fire, burning stuff down and designing up to need. Maybe that's even the more original way how Sprinters were born. So actually, I believe a lot of people will appreciate that. But let's talk about this unfeasibility of the existing solutions. So there are very different sprinkler solutions for different demands, even early suppression, fast response, ESFR sprinklers that can deliver enormous amounts of water. There are all types of water sprays that you can use. So you are sure that none of the existing solutions would fit? Why would that not fit? It was a lot of cost-benefit discussions. Okay. So we are building in the Northern Link, it was, as I said, a total of 15 kilometers of tunnel tubes that should be fitted with the system. So it's very important to get a layout that is cost-effective. And the most cost-effective way to build the pipes in the tunnel is just one pipe in the center of the ceiling and just feed it from each escape route, which we have 150 meters distance in the Northern Link. So that meant the most cost efficient layout that was 75 meter long deluge section of the way to next escape route. And there was no existing concepts that could build a section that looks like that within the regulations. So if we wanted to build that cost-effective layout, we had to break the regulations. You are the regulations. Yeah. That's a very lucky position. In the materials you sent me, there's a very striking thing related to this section. So if you have a 75 meter long section, you had the capacity because as you said, you already had the design very far advanced. So you were really capable of densities of 5 millimeters per minute. That's very low capacity for a large hazard. In high storage systems, you go for much, much higher values. And in this article you've sent me, you were saying that while for a high-risk storage warehouse, you really need these high values. Like, okay, the high-rise storage maybe somehow imitates the conditions within the tunnel in terms of the fire load, in terms of the material in the tunnel. I just had Hoyt Ingersoll, who said that when he went into a tunnel, he saw, like, stacked commodities on a truck, and that gave him inspiration to do these rune armor tests. So, indeed, there are similarities. However, the goal of a system in a warehouse is very different than the goal from the tunnel. Yeah, certainly. In a normal warehouse, the reason you put in a sprinkler system is to protect your facility, to save the building and the goods in the warehouse. But in the road tunnel, we are trying to slow down the fire growth just to buy us time to evacuate the tunnel and to have a small fire for the fire brigade to attack. We are not trying to put it out like you would do in a sprinkler system in a warehouse. So we have a different ambition than you have in the normal sprinkler regulation. So by acknowledging you are unable to achieve the complete suppression or the full safety goal of the warehouse sprinkler system, you also acknowledge that you're okay by just slowing the fire or by having any kind of benefit the typical sprinkler would give you, and you're fine with the fact that it will not be perfectly efficient against any fire you can meet. I guess it also probably comes down to the probability of fires and the probability it will be a large fire. I guess we will touch that at the later stage of the podcast, discussing your experience with this build and use system. your experience with this build and use system. But to continue on the design of the system, so the objective was to build up time for evacuation. The objective was to create conditions in which the firefighters can advance in the tunnel. Somewhere in the papers, there's a mentioning of reducing these 100 megawatt fires to approximately 30 megawatts, which seems much more manageable. Yeah, that's the dimensioning for the fire ventilation in the tunnel. That's 30 megawatts. Okay, so you also included that in. So that's a cost-effective solution because you can then make a significantly smaller system, which probably pays a lot of the costs of the sprinkles. So tell me about the development of that. You come in at the very late stage of the project. How do you design the solution and how do you verify that the solution that you're designing is actually meeting these new goals and objectives you've set? Yeah. As I said, we started to look at what do we want to build in the tunnel. And then we started to do some practical tests. What can that achieve that we want to build? And we were surprised, actually, by what we achieved at the tests. We used to work quite a lot with the Euker, as you talked to earlier. So there were both scale tests and full scale tests with different types of nozzles. And we were very happy to see the performance of these low pressure sideway nozzles because they create large droplets. And that's quite opposite what you usually say. If you listen to the water mist industry, they say you must have small droplets to cool down efficiently. But that depends on what you want to cool down. If you want to cool down a surface, then you need a big droplet that penetrates all the way down to that surface and hit it, and then get a large area when it's shattered in smaller droplets. And if you get these large droplets to penetrate all the way down to the fuel in the fire, then you get a very efficient suppression of the fire. So that's something we have seen, actually. The larger droplets, the more efficient suppression we get. And that makes us quite safe with this only 5 millimeters per minute. Okay, because you are sure that these 5 millimeters are actually delivered to the fuel because it's large droplets and they have a large momentum to penetrate the buoyant smoke. That's interesting. And the efficiency of this solution, it was tested by, trialed by fire, right? Yeah. So it was both scale tests and laboratory tests down at RISE in Borås. And we also made full-scale tests in Runahammar in Norway. There's an abandoned road tunnel where you can conduct full-scale tests up to 100 megawatts. We were just discussing that with Hoiker. Well, that's fascinating. Maybe you can tell us a little more about these experiments, like what you put in the tunnel and how the sprinklers worked there, like what was achieved? Yeah, we tried to simulate a full-scale heavy goods vehicle, the same type as Höker had burnt down in 2003. So there were wooden pallets and stuff? Yeah, exactly, 420 wooden pallets. And we had a steel roof on top of it to challenge the sprinkler system more. And then there were open sides to get enough air into the fire so you could reach these 100 megawatts. That's the potential peak of heat release rate. And what was achieved? Yeah, it depends on when you start the system. We did a few tests with these small nozzles for the northern links. We also did other tests with larger nozzles for later tunnel projects. But with this SW24 nozzles for 5 mm per minute, we achieved controlling the fire at around 30 MW, potential 100 MW fire. So this primary goal that also went into the design of smoke control system was achieved? Yeah, we could verify that's credible, getting it significantly down. And then we also did quite a lot of tests in an existing road tunnel where we had put up some test rigs so we could use different nozzles. And also there we had help from RISE. And we measured the temperature at different surfaces around the fire. And there we could see that it didn't really matter if you had 10 millimeters per minute or 5 millimeters per minute. The surface that got sprayed with the water never reached more than 70 degrees anyway. Because you had water floating at it so you can't physically go over 100 degrees. And you've mentioned about a system with a single pipe going through the central point of the tunnel. Yeah. You've also mentioned sideways spraying sprinklers. Yeah. How about the obstructions and the impact obstructions can have? I mean, you can have multiple trucks and very complicated geometry in the tunnel. Yeah, you could have large obstructions and small obstructions. When we look at small obstructions, such as road signs or lamps or these kind of things, then we are not really worried because there are relatively small areas that are shaded by these obstructions. So it has to be a really small fire to not be reached by the water. And we are not really bothered about small fires. It's the big ones we are fighting. The new also could have a large obstruction. You said heavy goods vehicle, and that is very important. You must look at the risk that you have a 4.5 meter high heavy goods vehicle in the tunnel. So the system, the demands we have on the system is that it must put water on top of such a vehicle. So you get water on top of the roof, and then it pours down on the side of it, both sides. So even if it's sort of shaded because you have a sideways sprinkler, it gets down to the opposite side of the vehicle anyway. As you're not focused on having the most perfect performance, but just sufficient performance to have evacuation and rescue operations, which then can target the sites which are shielded or something. I guess this is a big difference because if you were focused primarily on very uniform water distribution, it happens in sprinkler testing that we would be very focused on how delivery of water is distributed. What's the initial spray pattern? Where does the water go? Here it seems you had this performance objective behind your head all the time. Yeah, certainly. It's preventing fire spread. That's the important stuff. You should get everything as wet as possible while the fire is still small. That's the key issue here. Again, it's very helpful that you are setting the goals for your object, and it's not that you're a salesman who wants to sell someone's solution. So that's a very different setup. And I actually appreciate this setting a lot. It seems to allow a true performance-based engineering of the system. You've mentioned that the Runo Hammer tests gave different outcomes depending on the time of activation. So how is the trigger of the system decided? And how do you know where to fire the deluge system? Yeah, our tunnels are supervised by a manned control central. And as soon as they verify that there is a fire in the tunnel, they start a pre-action plan for the fires. And that includes activating the fixed firefighting system immediately. So after verifying the fire, it takes about 30 to 40 seconds before the first water reached the tunnel. Of course, early detection is very important. So we have a lot of different systems in our tunnels to detect the incident. Of course, we have the stop vehicle detection systems. We have smoke alarms in our cameras. If you suddenly get lower visibility, you get an alarm. We got heat sensing cables. And of course, we got full mobile telephone coverage in the whole tunnel. That's often the quickest way we get to know about the fire that someone calls in. The decision about triggering this sprinkler system is decision of personnel or there are like automated procedures? There is automatic solution as well. If the temperature in the heat sensing cable reach very high levels, then it activates automatically. But that's about 70 to 90 degrees, something like that. It's very high. So then you have a real disaster in the tunnel. So I guess there's a much higher chance that it will be already observed by cameras because you have automated incident detection. So it will tell you there's a stopped vehicle. I guess the cameras zoom on that so that the people, administrators know. Fantastic. And one more thing about these large droplets. They also give us a very good visibility through the activated section. And that's very important if you want to activate it immediately. So we don't have to wait for the traffic to stop or the people to evacuate by foot before we activate it. It's just that the second you see the verify that there is a fire or a probable fire, then you just start the system. Have you ever tried to drive through such a section of a operation? Yeah, suddenly. You look like a guy who would try that. Yeah, we did that. And also, unfortunately, the motorists in Stockholm also try that. So when we have had real fires, they don't stop, although we give them the signs in the ceiling, They don't stop, although we give them the signs in the ceiling, you know, these red crosses that they must stop, and the radio transmissions and text signs. They just keep driving through the activated sections, into the smoke and out of the tunnel. And how does it feel, like heavy rain? Yeah, really heavy rain. Really heavy rain. If you have a car in front of you, then it's no problem. It's just like driving through a snowstorm. You follow the taillights of a car in front of you, then it's no problem. It's just like driving through a snowstorm. You follow the taillights of the car in front of you. If you're the first car, then it's more challenging. So it's not the worst weather conditions a driver can find in Sweden. No. Certainly. You've mentioned at the beginning that you wanted a water delivery system that's simple, and I wanted this robustness. What were the factors in simplifying the system outside of using the existing hydrogen system to feed with water? Well, you know, by using very long sections, then you reduce the number of moving parts that you have to look after. moving parts that you have to look after. And also there was discussions about putting in extra valves that you could test the valves without getting any water out in the real tunnel. So you can test activate it while there's traffic in the tunnel. But we choose not to have that kind of systems because then we add another risk of failure. So we really want to keep it as clean and simple as possible. Reduce the number of moving parts as far as you ever could go. Now we just have two moving parts in the whole system. The big rubber membrane vent valve and the electric solenoid valve that operates all of it. And the pump pressure comes from what? In the northern link, it's just attached to the city water supply net, so there's no pumps. It's just normal water pressure. What kind of pressure does it operate at? We get about five or six bars into the tunnel system, and in the nozzles, we have 1.522 bars or something like that. Straight out of the city network? Yeah. That's good. What about the corrosion? The tunnel is not a very nice environment. No. Is it like stainless steel pipes? How did you know that? Yeah, we looked at that first, but then we actually chose to go for pre-manufactured plastic-coated steel pipes. So it's called Alvenius pipes. So they are plastic-coated both on the inside and outside and at the ends. So there are no exposed metal anywhere. I see. And that gives us a possibility to use copelings to build the system. So you just have a wrench, number 13 wrench. That's all you need to build the complete system. So it's, again, IKEA version. So there's no welding or anything when we build this system. It's just bolted together. Fantastic. And that's very good if you get damage in the tunnel, some sort of accident or incident, then it's very easy to repair. Fire protection system delivered in a flat package. Very nice. So now let's talk about your experience as a user of these devices. So before you said that their perception was that it will be very expensive to test, maintain, fix, audit. What's your experiences against that, these custom-built systems in your network? Yeah, we were actually very happy. Of course, all this testing were quite expensive, this development of the system. But if you look at that as one's cost, then we use this concept over and over again in different tunnels. So the more systems we build, the better it gets. So the audit part of it, it's also no big deal, actually, because we did this very good test together with RISE and Höker. And they are a sort of world-leading expertise. So no one could argue with their results and their conclusions that this system actually performs as we wanted it to. And when it comes to maintenance, we test every section once a year in the Northern Link. If we had followed the sprinkler regulations, we would have had a certified controller doing tests four times a year. And since we have something like 300 sections, we would have a full-time guy going there all the time. But by testing, you mean using a separate valve or just releasing the water through the section? The tunnel is shut for maintenance, so there's no traffic. So we open it fully, yeah. And then we look at the spray pattern that it's okay, so you don't have any damaged nozzles or something like that. Aha, very interesting, very interesting. Now tell me about real incidents. So do you have them for some use? I guess there were some fires in these tunnels. Yeah, in the Northern Link we have around one fire every year. So I think we have seven or eight fires now. And usually it's just normal cars. This spring we had something a little bit more challenging. We had a camper van that caught fire after a collision. So a medium-sized vehicle. Yeah, certainly. And it's glass fiber and plywood, so it was not a steel vehicle. So that was potentially quite a very big fire. But the system operated as it was supposed to, and it didn't put out the fire, but it controlled it. So the situation was not very dramatic. It controlled it, so the situation was not very dramatic. Höyker looked at the pictures afterwards, and he concluded that it reached about 10 megawatts in the tunnel. And if it had been a free-burning vehicle without a fixed firefighting system, we probably would have reached over 30 megawatts. And the vehicle would have been completely destroyed. Now there was quite a lot of fuel left that had been burned. Very interesting. And how does it work along with the longitudinal ventilations? Is there any negative interaction between the systems? No, I think it's actually performing better when you have the ventilation running. We have even increased the airspeed in the action plan. So now we are running it at three meters per second all the time, no matter the traffic situation downstream. Because you create turbulence when you have the high airspeed. And that means that the water gets into different parts of the vehicle in another way. So I think it's very good to have the longitudinal ventilation. Coming back to the camper fire, what was the exact damage to the tunnel and its systems from such a fire? There was some damages to cables on a cable tray just immediately above the vehicle because they drove at that side when when the accident happened so they stood right under the cable tray so there was some cables that got burnt and then there was a large road sign that got some soot and heat damage. But we could open the tunnel within two hours after the fire started. Within two hours? Yeah. Wow. That's resilience. And then it was also a police investigation, so perhaps we could have opened it even quicker if it was just because of the fire reasons. Have you left the sprinklers watered? The police are doing their job. Yeah, we should have. We should have got them out of the tunnel. I don't want to be nasty. That's what I would do, actually. You said it was on the side of the road where the campers stopped. And you had this single pipe system to the middle. So again, the shielding effects and everything and no observed negative interference of that. No, I think the system worked as expected. That nozzle can throw 7.5 meters sideways and we have them back to back in the center of the tunnel so we could cover up to a 15 meter wide tunnel. This tunnel, it was just two lanes so i think it was roughly 12 meters wide so we there was still some margins so now for the end i would love to talk about resilience you said that you've opened the tunnel two hours after the incident that that is amazing that's amazing resilience and i I had an episode of the podcast with Swiss engineer Ingo Reiss, who was talking about resilience in tunnels and the use of water suppression systems that provide that. I didn't hear when you were telling me the reasons, you didn't list resilience as one of the reasons, like you just focus on life safety. Certainly. Now it's one of the most important aspects, actually. So if you look at the socio-economic costs of a large fire, then it's certainly in favor of a fixed firefighting system, really. And put that sort of socio-economical costs into consideration for the future tunnels. Maybe I should ask, will you put this type of devices in all your tunnels now? Unfortunately not. As things are right now, it's when we expect traffic congestions, when the personal safe requires these type of measures. Yeah, we have one tunnel that is being fitted with the fixed firefighting speed system for socioeconomic reasons. And that is an old tunnel, a Tinkstad tunnel. It goes under a river in central Gothenburg. So it's a sink tunnel, you know, when you have a concrete box that you drop down on the bottom of the river. And that old concrete construction, it can't take a large fire. So then we could lose the whole tunnel. So therefore, we are fitting it with a fixed firefighting system. And what's the future for the Sultan Link tunnel, the one we've started with? Yeah, we are looking at it. We have several challenges with this tunnel. As I said, it's 100,000 vehicles per day. So you can't just shut it down and start mounting a fixed firefighting system because people would get crazy. So you have to do it at nighttime and you have to have some sort of traffic running in the tunnel. So therefore, we are looking at the system where we can cover the whole cross-section of the tunnel from one side. And also the tunnel ceiling is constructed in such a way that we are not allowed to attach anything in the ceiling. So we have to mount the pipes on the walls somehow. Okay, throwing water from the sides on the middle. And that tunnel is 15 meters wide, so we have to develop some sort of nozzles that can throw 15 meters. As I said, we are between 7 or 9 meters in the existing nozzles, but we are looking at means to increase this. If you find a solution, you intend to install that under the traffic and just overnight? That's very interesting. If you start doing that, I would love to see that. Maybe I'll come to Stockholm one day. I'll keep in touch. Thank you very much. That was very insightful. I hope the people from Sprinklr industry are still listening to this podcast episode. I am pretty sure a large chunk of them has switched to the radio at some point of the blasphemy you were saying here. But I found it very interesting. And I think it's one of a very few true performance engineering projects that go beyond and above codes and standards in the sprinkler industry. codes and standards in the sprinkler industry very a very interesting um case study and possibly interesting to to repeat in in other places of the world i know you're having a keynote at a istss conference so if so if someone would like to hear more about this tunnels plus see the videos visuals and learn more i guess that is a great uh place to meet, visuals, and learn more. I guess that is a great place to meet with you and learn more. If someone would like to read about the development of these systems, is it possible? Are the reports published? Yeah, everything is official. So either you can go by RISE or they can just Google it. If you can't find it that there will be ways to find it nothing is secret fantastic if it exists in the in the internet i will then link it to the show notes of this episode so the listeners can just by one click find the links to read more thank you so much all for coming to to the podcast and sharing your experience with us. I will certainly pass your experience to the Polish administration, because it sounds like very interesting findings and developments you have done. Actually, a similar system is being put in one of your tunnels. Okay, so that's the one. Okay, that's interesting. Oh. Okay, so that's the one. Okay, that's interesting. We have just one tunnel that's employing Sprint Design now, so I know which tunnel you're talking about. That's great. Then I may have a chance to see it in action sooner than I thought, because I think that one is being built right now. Ulf, thank you so much, and see you around. Okay, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much and see you around. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. See you in Stavanger. And that's it. Thank you for listening. I wonder what's more important in this episode, the technology of the luge system they are using in their tunnels, which works at very low water intensity and actually allows them to achieve their goal of slowing down the fire so the fire brigade may enter, extinguish, and it protects people and allows them to save escape. That's actually quite a good idea to build a system cut for the available water and available pressure and available parts. Really amazing effort to truly build a system for your own solution. Or maybe this other aspect is more important, the fact that they actually did it in a world full of regulations, you know, full of standards, codes, insurers. I mean, this system would never be approved if they were not an administration, if they were not creating their own laws in their own country, being able to do whatever they like to do. And I feel that's a shame. Maybe in many other places we would be able to design systems that could just fill our need. Exactly that and nothing more, nothing less. But we are limited by the system that surrounds us. A system that, of course, provides us safety and gives us some rules to play. I guess everyone in the game appreciates that or has to follow that, what we've built. But sometimes now on projects like this, having this complete freedom to design the safety solution for your tunnel, this is brilliant, brilliant. And now I know, as Milfo mentioned, they are installing a very similar system in Poland. Actually, one of the manufacturers who participated in these tests with Swedish Road Administration is now offering this kind of system with a single large pipe to the middle of a tunnel as a common solution that can be used in different tunnels. It's not the exactly same solution as far as I know. So you have a chance to change the length of the sections. There are pumping stations to get the performance you want to achieve. It is a little bit codified now, not as free as it was in Sweden. But still, it's an interesting advancement in providing fire protection for tunnels at, I must say, a moderate cost. And whenever the topic of sprinklers is brought up, in Poland at least, I don't know about your countries, but in Poland, it's always mentioned, this is going to be so expensive, we cannot afford that. And it seems you can. It seems if you're smart, if you're building your systems in a way that one safety feature can compensate for other safety features that you can maybe lower a bit, you may eventually find money to buy them. I really like this way of thinking, like this way of looking on safety, and I certainly appreciate how brave people like Ulf can still create and design new solutions in the 21st century when everything is rigid, tested and qualified. So thank you all for sharing your story with listeners of Fire Science Show. And listeners of the Fire Science Show, thank you very much for being here with me. And if you'd like to learn about my feelings about the invasion in Ukraine and what happened in here in the last year, you can join me on Friday where I will publish additional QA episode about this. And if you're interested in more fire science, there is a lot more fire science coming your way on next Wednesday. So thank you very much. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
