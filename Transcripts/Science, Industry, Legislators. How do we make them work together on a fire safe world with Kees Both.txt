 Hello and welcome to session 12 of the Fire Science Show. Today's episode will be a little bit different, maybe less scientish, and a bit more philosophical about our approach to building a fire-safe future. Today I'm hosting Dr. Keith Poth from Atex Group, and Keith is a fire researcher he's someone who runs a research center for ethics so so he's a manager science manager if if you may it's also someone who's actively involved in like almost every committee related structural fire engineering you can think of. So a person who creates a lot of impact in the way how new design standards and new pieces of legislation are born in relation to the structural fire engineering. And he's also very involved in building the community in Europe. also very involved in building a community in in the europe he's the past president of sfp europe and he's very active in in the board of sfp europe he was one of the people responsible for establishing sfp europe as a as a body in in here and we're very thankful for for his efforts in that and and continuously work on making SFP Europe a great society that connects so many views over the European fire safety. With keys, we're going to touch the important topics of how science, industry, and legislation play together. And I think it is very important to understand how this triangle works together. I mean, what are the roles of each of these stakeholders? What are their needs? And why we really need to talk a bit more to each other. And even though it's maybe not necessarily related to your everyday design work or your direct research that you're pursuing today. I think it's an important subject related to your future. So, yeah, it's going to be a good one. I hope you like it. First, let's spin the intro, and then let's jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello and welcome to the Firesize Show. Today with me is Keith Poth from Atex Innovation and Technology Center and a good friend. Hey Keith. Hi Wojcik, pleasure to be here. Thanks for taking the invitation. I'm very happy to have you on the podcast. With Keith, we have a history of collaborating in projects such as SFP Europe. We have a history of collaborating in projects such as SFP Europe. And what I've learned about him is a person who probably the best of all of us manages wearing multiple hats and rotates his position from researcher, engineer, someone running a research center, research center to someone talking to lawmakers and actually someone actively participating in creating a better future for European fire safety. Kies, how the hell do you manage all these ads? Thank you. Thank you for the compliment. Well, the listeners on this podcast can't see how I look like, but I've lost my hair and I've had almost a shaven haircut, so it's very easy to put on a new hat and swap hats or turn them around just a little bit. But no, seriously, it's, I think, something that grew upon me, not something that I dreamt of when I was a child. I want to wear as many hats as possible and don't budge underneath. But it sort of grows on you. And it's actually, I call it also stepping stones. So for some positions that I'm in, I need stepping stones. And the old days, I think the old days of, call it the lobbyists or the people who are concerned about regulations and standards they could with a certain attitude and stature just walk in a meeting room and say i know something about this standard and then just sit down and and have their opinion uh written down in a standard or a regulation these times have well maybe fortunately changed a bit, so you need to be officially appointed in some way or other. And then gradually you roll from one thing into another. If you are opening your mouth, which a lot of Dutch people apparently do a lot, and sometimes it makes sense what I say, then people listen and say, oh, could we invite you also to become a member of or to chair this committee or to chair that? And then I have difficulty in saying no. And, well, shit happens, so to speak. Yeah. Does that give an answer to your question? That's very down to earth. We were thinking about something like time travel or cloning technologies involved. But it seems it's just passion and willingness to participate. And that's a great thing. When discussing the podcast, I've put forth this idea that I would love to see how a certain triangle works, the triangle that consists of science, industry, and lawmakers. Because I think these three components are the most profound ones in forming a fire-safe future. There will be no fire-safe future without science. There will be no fire-safe future without industry participating in creating it. And there will definitely be no fire-safe future if lawmakers do not agree they want one so i would love to hear what's your take on the connections between the science industry and lawmakers but for now let's make it as if we were living in a perfect world not necessarily how it actually is is today um there are there are some key words that that i think are are necessary to describe how the ideal world should look like. In principle, people who are engaged and say the standardization and the regulation should be passionate about this. This looks like an open door, but it's not. Sometimes you see people in certain committees and regulatory debates who are sitting there just because they are paid. This is not a fruitful environment and productive environment. So we need people who are passionate about fire safety. And that's, I think, the root of it all. If you're passionate about fire safety, you're passionate about the science, you're passionate about the people and the companies who come forward with products and solutions and how to assess them and test them perhaps. So the ideal world, I think, is composed out of the, you called it a kind of a troika, so industry, science and regulators. a kind of a troika so industry science and and regulators um the key words those are centered around a passion for fire safety and to help the society in a more fire safe world i have to be careful here with my words because more fire safe would would perhaps wrongly be interpreted as more of this and less of something else yeah Yeah. But that's not what I mean. You should be passionate about fire safety, and the rest will follow automatically, I guess. There's a viewpoint I also share within my own actions, to be passionate about that. I certainly share the passion for discovering the fire and learning to live with that in a less dangerous way. I've asked you about the ideal world because for me in an ideal world, we would have science carving path for new technologies, industry happily implementing these new developments, forgetting about the solutions we know stopped working or we found replacements, and lawmakers creating law that promotes this. And in the real world, I have this feeling it's not always the same thing. I see scientists locked in their ivory towers, battling for impact factors and not necessarily looking for technological improvements. I see industry not really interested in new developments. The current ones work from a business perspective. And let's say in a five-year cycle, the innovation will not yield sufficient improvement over the previous technology. It may not be developed. It's not obviously for the whole industry, but I see many areas in which the innovation is not really sought. It's the stability and business continuity being sought. is not really sought. It's the stability and business continuity being sought. And lawmakers, this is the most difficult because they usually actually care and they usually want to provide safety, but a lot depends who they listen to, you know, and what the advisors tell them. So in the end, I see there's this imbalance in the triangle. I'm not even sure if the triangle should be balanced, actually. Maybe it should not. But, yeah, I see there's definitely a lot of improvements to be done in the communication between these groups. What do you think? Yeah, you address a number of valid points where sometimes science seems to withdraw in the ivory tower and looks with some disdain to lower life forms as industry and lawmakers. I should have started perhaps there because basically I'm also educated as a scientist, but I deviated like the black sheep from the family and got lost in industry. Let's hit the science hard and we'll come back to industry and lawmakers later in the podcast. Everyone will get a hit, but yeah, let's go with science. Yeah, well, I started my career in the Dutch ITB, so to speak. So I sort of got lost there as well. I initially had my head focused on dynamics of suspension bridges. And back in the day when I was young, there was this series, Streets of San Francisco. And it started with a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. And that for me was something. with a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, and that for me was something. If I ever finish my work in civil engineering, I want to be a bridge designer, and the dynamics of suspension bridges was fantastic. Then you should know where I'm actually living, which is in the southwest of the Netherlands, close to the delta from the river Scheldt. Initially, it was meant to build a connection between Rotterdam and Antwerp, and potentially that could be a bridge to allow for transport between those harbors. And I thought, wow, this was exactly the right timing for me to do my master's thesis on bridges. And then all of a sudden, because of some restrictions on the height of vessels that could underpass this bridge, the bridge design was transformed into a tunnel. So that flushed away my dreams of a big project in my backyard on the suspension bridge. And then I needed to look for something else. And sort of by coincidence, I find my way into TNO, and there was a shortage of someone with interest in numerical modeling, finite element modeling of steel and composite steel concrete structures in fire. I thought, well, there are not too many people that I know of, at least not in the Netherlands, that have a lot of experience with this. And I found my way to the fire lab. And for all the people who are listening to this, once you've set foot in a fire lab, you're sold. There's no way back now. There's no way back. You're hooked're sold. There's no way back now. There's no way back. You're hooked and addicted. There's no way back. So the same happened to me. And my first emotion was, okay, it's a good thing that I've dropped vibration analysis and dynamic analysis of suspension bridges. Hope I'm not offending any listeners here. Massive important, of course, but fire safety, sorry, is much more important and much more sexy than that. So that was gone in just like seconds. And I thought, wow, the smell in the fire lab, the diversity of work, it was just overwhelming. So this initials, call it love, never went away. It's still here uh but when you dig a little bit deeper into the semi-public institutes and and the science uh your eyes even are opened more wide the diversity of topics and and the other podcasts you you've managed to pull off give just uh just a flavor of it because it because there are many more podcasts to come. There's so many angles, so many things that are still unknown. So the science for fire safety is, for generations to come, one of the most appealing and diverse topics. There's no doubt. But that carries a risk in it because there's so much to look into. And if you want to really drill down to the bottom, you need to be a super specialist to know about, well, human behavior and evacuation, falling of concrete, smoke dispersion and tunnels. If you really want to drill down to the bottom, you need to be a super specialist. And have those people united and talk to each other is not so straightforward anymore. So it's very easy to, and perhaps necessary, to lock yourself in your ivory tower to really drill down to the big secrets of smoke dispersion and complex geometry. This is not straightforward. And then to come out of your ivory tower and talk to someone who is completely on the other side of the spectrum and fire safety is not so straightforward. So we have, as a fire safety science community, have to strongly focus on entities like IAFSS, SFPE, to really bring people together. And the corona crisis has not helped because even if you are a complete side, a different side of the spectrum, once you meet in a bar and have a beer, a lot of differences are easily bridged and you can become friends even though you work on a completely different side of the fire safety. And then also say that we can think a lot and be the super specialist in some form, but the deliverables, the findings need to find their way into the community. And for that you need industry. So we need a strong link to, first and foremost, I would say the designer industry, the consultants, the engineers, that puts the science really directly into practice. And then someone has to build it with products and stuff. So there's a clear chain of low of ideas into products that we need to cherish. And we need some people that build bridges. We can't expect from each and everyone to be outgoing, extrovert, and build all those bridges. There is a couple of people that will really be the engine or the fuel in the engine to share people's passion, be the engine or the fuel in the engine to share people's passion, to translate the passion from, say, a super CFD specialist to a super finite element specialist or an evacuation modeling expert and specialist. I think you've touched some very important points. As you said, the field is too wise to be an expert on everything it's uh it's impossible to to master evacuation fluid dynamics structural fire engineering material properties combustion and whatever else together in one package it's it's just inhuman to to be a master in all of these topics but thankfully we we have people who are masters of these topics within the community. So what we need more is to be smart reaching out and building strong teams, because it seems the fire safety is a team sport. It's not a game for singles, yeah? I think you've also, like, to go back to Professor Rain. He once said, when asked about how do you measure impact of science, he said that the most significant science or the most impactful science is the one that has the biggest, let's say, technological impact or the one that creates new technologies, new ways to implement solution in practice. And I kind of agree that in fire, of course, you can treat fire safety as a fundamental physics science or seek the fundamental phenomena within combustion there's there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and it's absolutely necessary but if we're talking fire safety engineering and and and this this let's say practical field of application of fire science and the role that we are here for i i think this applied science is is really truly the the most important one and guillermo also i don't know if you listened to his episode, but he has this ERC grant. And you know, ERC in European science is the holy grail. Like, that's the highest you can get in terms of achieving funding for your science. And yet, what Guillermo said is that ERC expects them uh people who get the grants to carve pathways for technologies they don't need to create technologies but what they they want is that the research being done will create pathways for new for new interesting technologies and i think there's much much research being pursued by many scientists in our field that create very interesting pathways to technologies. And selfishly, I have some research that creates very interesting pathways for technologies. And yet we struggle in getting the interest of the industry with these ideas. So you as a director of a research center for a global manufacturer of fire protection systems, how could a scientist gain the interest of the industry, of a major industrial partner to build the technology together maybe. What's your take? Can you give me a good advice? Wow. That's a difficult question, but I knew that when you invited me for the podcast. I first wanted to come back to what you said on Guillermo, and there is probably a number of reasons why Guillermo and his team were successful with that. And what I recall from the podcast you had with him was that he teaches his students to marvel and to wonder rather than try and measure everything immediately and go in full blown with all kinds of measurement equipment. But just observe and marvel and wonder. That for me, again, it may be a shortcut, but for me it's like try and become passionate about this by simply observing what is happening. Challenge your own beliefs and models and then eventually you will be successful. Yeah, absolutely. models and and then eventually you you will be successful yeah absolutely that that's a perhaps a bit of an introduction to to the answer um how can carving a pathway be successful for industry which i think you said it before um seems to uh to to have even shorter periods for return on investment than ever before. You need to be successful. You need actually to have the revenues in your hand already before you start something new. So it's sort of like a paradox. I think it's also a matter of patience. A lot of good innovations, the carved pathways, as you eloquently described them, might not find a profitable embedding in industry in one or two or three years. But sooner or later, they will be picked up. That's the advantage of our era, where a lot of innovations are stored digitally and can easily be found rather than in the past where you'd have to scan and visit libraries physically. So there's an opportunity there. But I think the word patients there is one thing. The other thing is to bring people together. is to bring people together. We may have to overcome some hesitation from, say, the people living in the ivory tower, but also we have to overcome the disdain from the industry, say, here again come these academics with no clue on practical implications. So, again, there's a limited number of people who have to be patient, strong enough, and bold enough to bring people together from industry and from science and say, guys, have a good time. Here's a topic. You talk about possible solutions and you talk about how this in practice could work. But from brainstorming perspective, say, okay, thank you. I hear this. And this is how it potentially could work. Or these are challenges we need to overcome. And sometimes I miss that kind of a dialogue between really the producing industry and science. And there's, again, bridges to build. To come back on what you said, I think we could easily switch the title of the episode into the fundamental role of pubs in the development of fire safety science. But yeah, maybe let's not go that far. On a serious note, like what you've said now, I completely understand. I did before, but I totally understand why you have been the president of SFP Europe, because SFP seems like the place where it's very, maybe not easy, but it's very successful in mashing up the industry people, engineers and scientists in one closed room and and force them to talk, which from my perspective has been very beneficial. And I think if we want to have a bright future, we need more organizations like that, that are not close to one group or not particularly focused on a single group, but focus on the interaction between them. on the interaction between them. Maybe this is a direction we should be cherishing when building the post-COVID conference plan. What do you think? Yeah, absolutely. And don't get me wrong, so academics need to be in a safe environment to talk with academics, and industry needs to be in a safe environment just to talk amongst the industry. Lawmakers need to also have their own pub, if you like. But there should be one environment and one or two associations that bring all three together every now and then and bring the best out of it. The COVID crisis has learned us a number of things. By the way, it's not impossible to bring together people from different backgrounds, so to say, in this Troika triangle of science, industry, and law. But it's a challenge. But there is always room for digital meetings once people know each other and once there is a clear agenda. I guess you need to be together and have a drink together and contemplate over dinner and mix the business talks with a little bit of private talks. Because that's where the creative thinking actually comes from. If you are with people that are thinking in the same direction or have the same tools as you have, it's very difficult to step out of your comfort zone. I think if we want to touch upon the third part on the triangle, I think science and industry are not that bad. But it may be a challenge to really link and engage the lawmakers and the regulators. This is not straightforward, but it's also not impossible, I've learned. But to come back to fire safety, one of the concerns I have, I mentioned that to you before, we obviously should save the planet. So for me, it's a no-brainer that we need to do something like the Green Deal, call it like that, on European level and on global level. But if you read all the documentation and listen to all the narratives and hear all the eloquent speakers speak about sustainability and climate change and recycling. It takes a lot of pages to find the word fire, if you find it at all. So here is something that we need to bring to the table, perhaps, of the European regulators, maybe also the national regulators, because my strong opinion and conviction is that in Europe, we have all the elements for a real strong fire safety strategy and policy. We have the top-notch universities. We have the IMFSE, for example, Lund, Ghent, Edinburgh, Zurich. We have the top-notch applied science research institutes, ITB, BAM in Germany. There's so many more. Again, RISE, TINO, all of them. So they're active and they're world-class material. active on and they're world-class material. Then we have European industry as well, which sometimes also is active on global level. But sorry, when you look at ATEX or, for example, ArcelorMittal or Arup in the UK, these are companies that literally spend millions on a fundamental research, which is very nice. So all of this we have in Europe, and you could argue, well, all these parts of the triangle work by themselves, and so why bother? But that, of course, it works. But that, of course, it works. But I would argue there is a case to be developed to say, guys, if we want to be the leading region in the world on fire safety, we have all the elements. And let's pronounce that. Let's claim that, that fire safety is a sector where Europe is excelling. And then if you have that kind of backdrop and support from European regulation perspective, then I guess a lot of puzzle pieces will fall into each other. You've mentioned sustainability, and I think from my own perspective, from my own view, the fire safety may not be necessarily the goal of the sustainability, but it definitely is the enabler. Exactly. The thing that enables the sustainable future. Because, for example, if you focus on, let's say, energy efficiency of buildings, you end up with facades that burn. If you focus on electromobility, you end up with mobile power plants or mobile energy storage systems that burn. All of these technologies, in a way, there is to solve, let's say, the energy problem of the building or let's change the way the energy is stored, I mean, you can solve that. But at the same time, you can create unsolvable fire problems. And it's all good until a huge building burns down, until many people die in a fire. and then suddenly a technology that was a breakthrough for one field becomes a nightmare in the fire domain and without smart fire engineering without without our people let's say the scientists the industry uh and we need to also stay in the lawmakers the challenges that are created by the by the change we need to also teach the lawmakers the challenges that are created by the change. We need to learn to manage the changes in the technologies of the world. I always say to my students that your future seems bright. We are creating more fire problems than we are able to solve at the time, so there's always going to be some fire issues to be solved, which is maybe not a great thing. But in a sustainable future, the fire is a key puzzle. And yeah, it also breaks my heart that in the Green Deal or in these huge Horizon Europe programs, the fire is not one of the focal points. And it's really, from a researcher perspective, when you have to fit into the themes of these projects, it's really very, very hard to find your angle that will make you do your research which you want, which is on fire, and align with the goals of the project, which the fire may not be in. Yeah, exactly. If you write proposals, that was already back in the day when we had these large tunnel fires. So when I was still with TNO, after finishing my PhD on numerical calculations of composite steel concrete slabs, which, by the way, the calculation rules ended up in the Eurocode. So I have something to say to my grandchildren. Congratulations. But then I sort of thought well that's what you have when you're focused on one very niche topic. Sorry to deviate a little bit from this but I recall one of my papers to be presented in Hong Kong at Asia Flam and the session chair was Vito Bobrascus. And I did my presentation and afterwards, are there any questions? No questions, of course. And then Vito said, well, in case I have a question. That was my first meeting with Vito, and he still is one of the gods in our sector. So I was in awe, and I was shaking, and I was sweating all over. If this guy is asking me a question, I might just want to duck underneath one of the tables and and yes the question came uh case how many people actually have died from a composite steel concrete slab uh collapsing in a fire so you're developing calculation rules but but how relevant are they um yeah and my wife was was with me uh it was our first uh trip um to to an international conference and and she was like okay case, it took ages before you came to some kind of an answer. And honestly, I'm not even sure what I answered. But for me, it was like, okay, there's probably much more in fire safety science than there is what I know now. what I know now. And very dramatically, there were these big tunnel fires in the Alpine regions in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And that's the long introduction to the question, because that made me switch my interest in finite element modeling into tunnel fire safety, which is a totally different ballgame. And we started to prepare research proposals for the European Commission. And at first they were like, do we have a problem then? Well, we have seen some dramatic tunnel fires. You may need to think twice about not addressing fire safety. And back then it was the fourth and the fifth framework program, which is now horizon europe and but we we kept on call it lobbying maybe that's where the first seeds were sown for for me to to say okay if if we want to push science and industry forward we need to convince the regulators and the ones who provide subsidies for research on the level of the regulator with a proper narrative. And this narrative was like, okay, guys, if we want to continue building the European market, we need to have safe and reliable transportation. And tunnels make an essential part in that. So we need to have them safe and reliable. and that. So we need to have them safe and reliable. And apparently, they are not so safe and sound as we initially have thought. There may be a number of causes there. Maybe the traffic volume, the composition of the traffic, the one-way or two-way traffic tunnels, the ventilation, longitudinal transfers combined, the goods that are being transported. Well, we've all seen one of the first big fires in the Channel Tunnel where pork fat was one of the main fire loads or combustibles. Where initially a lot of people said, well, pork fat, how dangerous can that be? How relevant is that? How relevant is that? And then, well, eventually we ended up in some very nice European co-funded tunnel fire safety projects. I had the pleasure of being in one of the project leaders, the Upton, upgrading of existing tunnels. That was also very enriching, meeting up people from, I think we had 33 partners in the project from like 16 or 17 countries with an 11 million euro budget. Back in the day, that was a huge research budget. And we did fantastic tests. We did large-scale tests. Nobody believed that it was necessary to do a large-scale test. We had did fantastic tests. We did large scale tests. Nobody believed that it was necessary to do a large scale test. We had furniture in there. Nobody thought that with furniture, you could create havoc in a tunnel fire. It was eye opening. So sometimes you have to, as a scientist and as industry, be a little bit stubborn and say, guys, to the regulators, you really have an issue. And we can solve this for you. But then we need to have some, well, tailwind, if you like, from you guys that you appreciate as a regulator that some findings will finally cascade down into new regulation. And I think we were to a degree successful there was a european directive on on road tunnel uh fire safety which carved again coming back to to to your word there carved the path for uh for risk analysis and and tunnels which again back in the day was was not so mature as as it is now um you can challenge if if it was really scientific research that we've done, but these large-scale tests in the Rinehammer tunnel in Norway that we did were a bit unique and almost first of their kind. And they are still news to a lot of people. They're 20 years old already. There are still works being published, and these experiments are a cornerstone of tunnel fire safety. And whenever there's a new student picking up tunnel fire safety and trying to model something or learn something new, recreating runehammer in CFD is the first thing you should do because that teaches you so much. Yeah, and then to come back, if you now look at regulations and standards that go into tunnel fires, the magic number is, or the table with magic numbers gives some heat release rates. And it says like passenger car, 5 megawatt, small van, 10 megawatt, a bus, 30 megawatt, and a lorry, HTV, 100 megawatt, and an oil tanker, 200 megawatt. That's it. And I don't need to convince you to say that this table was nice 20 years ago, then it was news. But nowadays, how accurate are these numbers? Actually, have you ever seen tunnel fires that only consume one car or one truck? So we do need to be prudent there and not say, guys, we've looked at this 20 years ago. Is the situation still the same? It's not. I don't want to say now that tunnel fires are the biggest risk of all, but some research I think is necessary to look at realistic fire scenarios and not declare these tables with magic numbers the holy grail for... Yeah. Keith, I think you're touching a very, like, on the example of tunnels, we are touching the pinnacle of this triangle, because when you were listing your ideas in the Upton projects, the problems to be solved, it was mesmerizing, because in one sentence you've captured, like, five extremely interesting subjects to be studied within the tunnel safety. But today when you open the tunneling and underground space technology, you'll not see research focused on the growth of heat release rate in multiple vehicle fire scenarios. You will not see these brave ideas you've mentioned. these brave ideas you mentioned. You will see countless studies on figuring out the baccalaureate distance or critical velocity up to the third significant digit in a straight tunnel, curved tunnel, angled tunnel, tunnel with two vehicles, tunnel with one vehicle upside down. It's ridiculous the amount of... It's not pseudoscience, but it's like useless science that's being manufactured. Because it's publishable, it's easy, because it fits the purpose of the scientists to have a paper published in a prestigious journal, and that journal is very prestigious. For me, they failed to solve any practical issue we currently have with tunneling. And it's not one or two papers. It's a majority of papers that touch fire in this aspect. And this is the bright example of what being locked in an ivory tower in terms of fire science means. It means seeking answers to possibly interesting scientific questions without any relevance to the real world. And in tunneling, I say that with full understanding of what it means, because I design tunnels. I've designed like, I don't know, 40 tunnels. Whenever I see a paper, whenever I see a simulation, the initial conditions in that simulation are like zero. There's no flow, there's nothing happening, and then the fire starts. Well, in reality, I have never been in a tunnel where there was no air movement. Exactly. If you've once been in a tunnel and tried to open a door or tried to speak to your colleagues, why this noise? Why this wind? Yeah, there's always an initial condition. And we fail to recognize this as the science community that our research has been so... It journeys so far away from the practical problems of this area. And I think it's not unique to tunneling. I think in many areas of fire science, there is this group of very smart people doing their work, but just... Yeah, sorry to interrupt you. I think we should continue to do that because there will always be people who there's always deep dive records to be broken. So please let those people who want to do deep diving, let them try and break the record. But that should be kind of balanced when people that say, OK, we've always deep dived here on this spot. Let's try and deep dive 100 meters from here. And you move the boat. But I think you catch my drift. So let those people do that. I think it's also a matter of our science sector becoming a little bit more mature. We have the tools to do more, call it realistic scenarios and model them or test them. This is possible. But again, we would need a little bit of tailwind and we would need a little bit of open-mindedness of the regulator to say, okay, I've always worked and in my regulations it provides, please show that this tunnel does not show any back layering, zero back layering. You can argue, why the hell do we need zero back layering? But, okay, that's something else to discuss. But the regulators should perhaps be a little bit more open-minded to say, okay, we will have this five-year cycle of, I don't know what, revision of our building codes or regulations. And once there are good findings, we are inclined to open that up and to change for new builds, and perhaps with some retrospect also renovations of existing buildings or tunnels with these new findings. also renovations of existing buildings or tunnels with these new findings. And that would be a kind of continuous learning, where obviously the regulator may need to have a longer revision cycle than we would need for a product or a tool like FDS. We can have an update and a beta version every month or so. Nobody cares, but the regulator can't update the regulations every month. So we need to be a little bit more open-minded. But to be more focused on, say, the reality and what could actually happen is certainly something that we can push forward. certainly something that we can push forward. And again, here an anecdote. You may no doubt have heard of the Faculty of Architecture and Delft at Quadfire. There is an anecdote there. I was in TNO back in the day, and I got a call from Brian Meacham just a week or so after the fire happened. And he said, Kees, can we partake in the research that is happening already or will soon start after the collapse of the Faculty of Architecture, University of Delft? after the collapse of the Faculty of Architecture, University of Delft. And I said, but Brian, there is no research, and very likely there will be no research into how this building actually collapsed, how the fire could occur, how it spread, and how that eventually led to the collapse of the building. And it was sort of silent. I said, Brian, are you still there? Yes, he was flabbergasted, of course, in a negative way. He said, but how can this be? And he said, we've been desperate. Again, apologies for this wording, perhaps, but we've been desperate in the U.S. to find an example of buildings that actually collapsed and that we, after 9-11, that we can use our tools that we have developed and the knives that we have sharpened on simulation of what happened in 9-11 on another realistic incident. And fortunately, there were no casualties. So this should be perhaps non-controversial whatsoever. And I said, well, this sort of is a closed book because some hotshot people in the Netherlands have declared that this fire had developed according to the book. So no need to investigate, no casualties. That's it. The only thing that perhaps would need to be investigated is how the fire brigade could position themselves because there's a little bit of a pond, was a little bit of a pond in front of the entry. So it was not easy to position the fire trucks. And there was some helicopter which kind of cosmetically threw a little bit of water from high up in the fire trucks and there was some helicopter which kind of cosmetically threw a little bit of water from high up in the air on this building fire which didn't do a lot but was good footage on national television and I still wonder and I'm still advocating for these type of collapses and actual fires, but perhaps also near misses, to try and with the tools that we have today and all the science that we have today, to remodel and call it a kind of seconds from disaster type of approach, but then with real science and with real technology, try and investigate what actually could have gone wrong and where we miss certain information that already, perhaps for me, at least suggests an area of further research. If you have to take certain assumptions to make your model either a scaled-down test or a combination of all kinds of fancy models. For me, this seems like a logical way to close the circle. It's in line with what others have said to how, for example, our construction industry compares to the aeronautic industry, where there is this feedback loop. And in the construction sector, we miss that. And again, I think it's teaming up of science and industry to convince the lawmakers and the ones responsible for regulatory subsidy, if you like, to say, guys, we really understand what happened in the past. These are the lessons learned. And this is what we should embed in regulation and in design for the future. Coming back to how regulators can, let's say, benefit from particular research subjects or particular research being taken, and how to promote particular fields of research without hurting the fundamental freedom of picking your research aspects. Some time ago on Twitter, there was a discussion related to development of FDS. Professor Rainbrooth, he has proposed many, many years ago, like a decade ago, has proposed many, many years ago, like a decade ago, that maybe the developers should give a yearly award, like just a diploma and a credit to a research body or researcher who has done the most significant discovery or research work that impacted the development of the software. And I think in this concept, he touches the very vital point that what really drives people in the research industry, you know, because it very rarely is money, because if you want to be a researcher and earn good money, you should work on R&D in some fancy fancy unicorn company then maybe it's possible but definitely not in the on in a university i'm not sure well maybe yeah yeah i'm not sure if you have the power over budget but if you have you can change that um anyway um it's it's not always the money it sometimes is this you, you know, prestige, this, let's say, glory, this ego-boosting things. And if regulators could step into this by, for example, starting a contest for the best solution for, let's say, protection of secondary steel elements in a structure that would yield the most cost-effective yet safe solution for such a protection, and then could present an award for the best solution out of many. I think many people would compete for that just to be given this award for the solution or to win this type of a contest, because that's something you can proudly present in your academic CV as your own achievement and achievement of your team. And I know many, many scientists who would really pursue this type of I know many, many scientists who would really pursue this type of awards where there is really not a market for such thing in here. In architecture, it's really common that you open a contest for the pre-design of your next landmark building, right? It's very common that the best projects are chosen on the basis of contests. Yet in fire science or in science in general, I very rarely see these types of activities, whereas they will not take a lot of money. I mean, it sounds like a very efficient way to promote certain research areas over others by the lawmakers or by the practitioners without really limiting the capability of these free researchers, deep divers, who want to be left alone and just research the fundamentals and maybe stumble upon something really, really great. Yeah, I fully agree. And in the end, we're all human right so we can all do with with a touch and a tap on the shoulder and and a compliment and um i'm not a psychologist but but there must be research uh done that if you compliment people uh probably you'll get more out of them and and a better relationship than if you continuously harass them and put forward negative comments. And a lot of discussions that I see with regulators, there's a lot of pain coming from either the design industry or producing industry or even scientists. And say, why haven't you introduced this and this standard or that regulation and so forth? So it's always, you haven't done these nine things. Okay, you have done this one thing, but okay, what about the other nine things? Whereas if you indeed would put this one thing that was successful and found its path that was carved for science and industry into regulation, if you cherish that and put a person or a group or an entity on a pedestal and celebrate this, this creates this environment of trust and collaboration. Positive environment. And appreciation and positive vibe that I think we need, which I definitely think as FPE, specifically perhaps as FPE Europe, we could work on. We need to come back to that on SFPE Europe because it would be, like SFPE has already this bunch of fantastic awards that are given on a person basis, like for achievements of a single person. And in SFPE Europe, we also have the Jean-Claude De Smet award that's been introduced some years ago. But for example, SFP UK chapter has the awards for the best project, for the best research item. And maybe things like that, maybe more topical could be something to be introduced by the SFP Europe to promote particular areas of science, which we as, and now I'm talking we as SFP Europe, because I'm also a proud part of that entity, things that we as the SFP, as the engineers who are doing science, we need and we appreciate the most. So this discussion will continue definitely in the larger group. Yeah, but like you said, and there are a number of persons for those on the podcast that have listened to the SFP Europe conference and the interviews we had there. Just to name, again, one person, Michael Schleich. He's a regulator from one of the states in Germany. He's very passionate about fire safety and wants to develop, say, the future generation of fire safety regulation. future generation of fire safety regulation. And it's people like him who are the movers and shakers that should represent their sector and moving forward. I was very impressed with the SFP Europe because you've also attracted Heikki Vananen, who is also responsible for the facade developments, and he was also very, very passionate. And he was a fantastic active listener he really did care about what was being said and i i had i've been in contact with him after the conference and i'm really impressed because with people like that in in the power it's not this dirty politicians uh who count the money on the side but it was truly someone who who seemed to be willing to make a change and difference and uh and this is the the spirit that i would cherish the most in the lawmakers as as you started the podcast is the passion that that makes it different definitely and i was you took the words right off my mouth so i I was trying to build a case from a country to Europe. Yeah, it's very fortunate that people like Heikki Vanan are engaged and passionate and want to learn really about the fire safety sector and how to move it forward. His engagement indeed with the European Facade Project to come together to bring together people and industry to develop a fire safety test and classification and perhaps even certification method for facades and facade elements. It's fantastic. This is a hot potato, not an easy project. And certainly, you guys have contributed a lot with your research on facades. Again, there was a lot of nasty incidents. Grandfell obviously being the most prominent one that pushed this project. Unfortunately, not the only one. And unfortunately, not the only one. And probably not the last one. And unfortunately not the only one and probably not the last one either. But it's good that the regulators see the need for providing this tailwind. Forgive me for using this metaphor again. If the regulators provide tailwind, this sort of seems like at least catalyzing if not also initiating this triangle to come into movement. And if there is any unbalance there, perhaps it can generate enough momentum and gyroscopy for this triangle to keep on turning and produce something nice as a deliverable. Okay, let's jump a bit out of the triangle now, because there's one more thing that we need to talk. Science, industry, legislation, these are the things to create the fire-safe reality. But for the truly good future, we also need a new generation of engineers. So let's spend the last minutes of the interview on education. And that's another very difficult subject because of the way how fire is being taught in different countries. For example, in Poland, we have the fire safety engineering course within the officer academy for fire officers. So every fire officer is a fire safety engineer in Poland. And there's a bunch of civilians being trained along with them. Me being a very happy participant of that course. In some countries like, for example, UK, I see there's more people jumping from structural engineering into fire than from any other, and they have very strong structural fire engineering. In some countries, you don't have any kind of professional educations related to fire, and people are just coming from different backgrounds learning fire as they work. fire as they work. I wonder if there is one good idea for educating a European, let's say, generation of fire engineers of the future. What do you think? Yeah, thank you. Very good. And good to try and finish with the future, the next generation. A number of things that pop up in my mind. Just before Corona, I was invited. We are a sponsor of the IMFSE, and there was this sponsor event in Lund beginning of last year. I was invited also to speak. And again, if you are confronted literally with the young generation, so much full of energy and the variety of topics that they're interested in. I had the idea, well, the future is bright. We have good students from all over the world, from Australia, the U.S., and less developed countries and regions of the world as well. So this looks fantastic. But it's not a given. So we need to work on continuously being attractive for this generation to come and generations to come. And I think we have all the right elements. We have all the right elements. It's science from every perspective, mathematical, numerical, testing. Empirical, yeah. Empirical, everything. So we have everything. And still, if you ask the anecdote there, if you ask people to explain candle fires it's not so straightforward so if that simple analogy again the anecdote here I started civil engineering because when I did the the intro week in Delft University I visited a lot of of faculties but then when when I came to to civil engineering there was this professor in soil mechanics and and he had a bit of a sack in his hand with a tube coming out of it. And he said, well, guys, if you can explain this, and then he squeezed the sack, and then you saw the water level in the tube, you saw falling down rather than rising. He said, if you can understand what happened here then probably you can earn big bucks in uh in the future and that blew me away and then later on you learned that this was about packed sand uh that if you squeeze in it you you open the sand and then the water can can penetrate in between um but but for for me it was like magic and there were a lot of people say i want to learn about this so uh we have to bring these rather simple uh things to to students in the future and that that's the bridge to another element that i think is necessary we should not only focus on on the academics um because there's there's a lot to teach because the actual fire safety, I think, is generated by people who install the sprinkler bulbs and install the fire-stopping machete and put on the anti-machete coating or fix the ventilator in the ceiling, or wire up the fire alarm panel. It's those people also that need to be thought about this, and they also learn on the job in the majority of cases. So the whole ladder, if you like, from people who make their hands dirty and stand with personal protection equipment in a lousy environment on a job site to finish the work up to the academia. We need to educate. So that's a topic that I would like to address as well. So it's not only the masters and PhD students that we need to be prudent for and provide them a good career path. It's also a little bit more to the practical side that we need to educate people. let's say the passive fire which which we are the designers the uh let's say developers of of protection systems and the active fire people which would be the firefighters and do you see any way to improve the dialogue between between us we on an european level yeah we we we have to and um i i think there's there's also a dialogue there to start. I'm not stated that actually the dialogues exist already, but I do think that we need to strengthen that a bit. Because in essence, if you have big shopping malls, high-rise buildings, complex underground facilities. In the end, the rescue workers and the fire brigades, they will go in to try and put out the remainder of the fire or search and rescue and so forth. And they have to be shown and they have to be assisted by tools and methods to observe what is happening, but also safeguarded by a structure or other safety measures that do what they are supposed to do. Not because they had a certificate, but that they really do the job. And that is something where we need input from their eyes. They're observing. They're marveling at a certain situation. And I think that dialogue, the feedback loop of what especially firefighters come across when they try and fight a fire to feed back that into the system of product and system development, whether it's a sprinkler or a passive system or smoke extraction system or alarm system, it doesn't matter too much. But what they observe to really feed that back into the development and science loop is, I think, a bit underappreciated. And, well, their job is different. I had discussions in the past before when we tried to develop a project to say, okay, what can we learn from real fires and incidents? And then people in the fire brigade told me, well, it's all fine and good, but when we are really at your doorstep and when your house is on fire we don't have any time to fill out an evaluation form uh what we see and what what we measure so okay if if it's time and if it's the the ease of of transforming what you observe back to us it's maybe just a helmet camera or or some other measuring device but but we have it doesn't need necessarily to be real time what we can see or what what what you hear but it can also be post incident but then with your eyes and expertise together with what what we see so if you observe literally from two different perspectives, a scientist and a firefighter, you look at the same image and footage, and what is it that you see, coming back to what Guillermo said, it is so enriching if you put those people in the same room and say, guys, tell me what you see, what is it that you observe? And the fire brigade will say, I see flames or I see smoke or I see whatever. I see a flashover situation which is occurring very quickly. And the scientist might say, I see or I don't see any objects anymore. So the visibility, I see soot. I see, I don't know what, the smoke moving in one direction. And when you bring those two elements together, there's, I think, a wealth of knowledge that we still haven't connected. So connecting those dots and your terminology, bringing those people together, a scientist and a firefighter, is again building a bridge that we need some people to just take the initiative and make it happen. It is really important to build these connections with the firefighters as well in mind. I mean, if I designed the world's best smoke control system, and a fire commander takes the decision to turn it off because they don't like it, it was not such a good system after all, right? And so there needs to be a bridge between the science industry and the firefighters, the men on the ground as well. industry and the firefighters, the men on the ground as well. And yeah, I think here, again, the passion is something that can actually unite us with the firefighters, because we're pretty much passionate about the same thing, just different aspects of it. Maybe not even different. Maybe we're actually passionate about the exact same thing. Coming back to where we started off, I think in the beginning, the reason why I chose fire safety, because the Golden Gate Bridge was not to be rebuilt in the southwest of the Netherlands, but it was supposed to be a tunnel. Later on, I did a lot of work also on the fire safety of the tunnel, the Westergelder Tunnel. And there was quite some debate about who should be in control of the fire safety measurements and design should that be the tunnel operator who was trained on the job to push the buttons or should it be the fire brigade officer who really understands how fires could could develop or should it be both? Or should it be neither? And should it just be the system that automatically kicks in the ventilators or the sprinkler system or the barriers and the traffic lights and so forth, or open up or close the escape doors from the connecting tunnels? And those are discussions that we are still having. And who should be in control? from the connecting tunnels. And those are our discussions that we are still having. And, and who's, who should be in control. And it's, it's sometimes it's just a matter of bringing the people together and say, okay guys, together we will have a protocol and maybe in every tunnel it potentially could be different because it just depends on, on where, for example, the, the fire brigade is stationed. Are they close by or are they far off? Does traffic control actually sit literally physically on top of the tunnel? Or is it somewhere in the center remote from this tunnel? You could argue who has the best papers to go into the tunnel and actually see, observe, and marvel what's going on, appreciating that the tunnel was designed to cope with some scenario or other, but the situation at hand is slightly different, so you have to tweak what is happening. You can't rely on a fully automated system. Those are discussions where if you put people in the room who are inclined to listen to each other, listen to the arguments rather than hide behind a certificate or a protocol or this is how we've always done it in the past or this is what worked in this situation, but are open to listen to others. That's where the gold can be found. If you have eyes and ears predominantly opened towards the other, rather than ventilate your own opinion, then that's the recipe for gold. I think that's a good point to close the discussion on. However, we'll continue this talk in the SFP Europe group for sure because so many ideas sparked to the head. And I think together as SFP Europe, we're on a good route to truly be one of the fundamentals of the future fireiresafe Europe. And, yeah, that's a great thing. And thank you for leading this during your time of being a president and now supporting us a lot as well. So, Kies, thanks a lot for taking the invite to the podcast. It was a pleasure to have you here. It was a pleasure. It was all mine. And looking forward to see you in person in the not-too-far future and have this beer again together. Yes. I share your view on the importance of pubs in building the progress of fire science. And I think from these positions, we are safe to invite all the listeners to Copenhagen next year for the SFP performance-based conference, right? Absolutely. Thank you. Yes. Hopefully it will happen in person. I think we're on a good track. So, once again, thank you very much and see you around. Okay. Thank you, Wojciech, and thanks for the listeners. And that's it for the interview with Kies. Kies is an amazing guy and I truly love speaking to him. I wonder what the suspension bridge industry would be today if he has chosen that career path instead of going into the fire. We can only wonder. Keith had some really great insight. And listening to him, you hear someone who truly has an experience in merging the worlds of science, industry, and legislation, someone who was fueling the education and progress in our discipline. So it's not a hypothetical consideration. It was his practical knowledge and experience in dealing with these aspects of fire safety. And the idea of attracting legislators to give us some tailwind to develop research ideas, and ideas to bring industry and science together in the same room to just talk and figure out what are the needs of the other party, figure out if we share the same ideas, the same goals, the same passion. And I hope you noticed the word passion was the key word of today's episode. I truly think that from passion comes the best things in our industry, the best solutions, the best ideas, and that passion is truly necessary for creating a fire-safe future. So I hope you're full of passion for fire and full of passion for fire protection engineering. And I hope you enjoy listening to this podcast and feel your passion with the thoughts being shared in here. And if you do, then we'll see you next Wednesday on the next episode. Thank you for listening. See you around. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
