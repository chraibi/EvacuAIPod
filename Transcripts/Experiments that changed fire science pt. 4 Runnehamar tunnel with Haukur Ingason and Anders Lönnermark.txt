 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. We're here again in the series of experiments that have changed the fire science. I wonder if name Runehammer rings a bell for you. If you're someone dealing with road tunnels or fire safety of tunnels in general, I guess that's the case. If not, please let me take you to the world of probably biggest and most important tunnel experiments done in the last 20, 30 years. Experiments that have really changed the way how we design road tunnels. It has been a very bold series of research done in a very specific state in Europe after a series of really large fires with many faculties. As I've read in some of the papers, European citizens have lost the trust in the European tunneling network and many, many advances have been done at that point. And one of these advances has been done by SP in Sweden, now known as RISE, by a group of Professor Heiko Ingersson, and an important figure in that, also Dr. Anders Lunemark. Both of them are my today's guests, and they take me to their times at Runehammer, explain how the research has been done, what were the challenges, what were the findings, what were their assumptions and how well they were met. Actually, it's pretty fantastic. I'm going to spoil it a little bit. They focused on finding one answer on what is the heat release rate of a fire in a tunnel, build the whole experiment around that, done everything to figure out that number reliably for multiple scenarios, figure out what's the worst outcome. And once they achieved that, they implemented that, or the society implemented their findings into standards codes. Really, what they found out during these experiments, we are literally using on every single tunnel. That's the type of impact I think we should be seeking in fire science, you know, making one really good experiment that truly makes an impact, that truly changes something we can call the paradigm of the fire safety design. And that's what these guys achieved, and this is why they are here now to talk about an experiment that really changed fire science. In a world where more publications are coming every year than ever before, in a world where Vogue research is published for impact factors and citations, published for impact factors and citations. This type of research that truly makes an impact and changes the discipline is something we should seek and I'm super happy to talk about it with Heiko and Anders. So yeah, that's absolutely enough. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. This podcast is produced in partnership with OFR Consultants, a multi-award winning UK-based fire and risk consultancy. OFR are supporting a number of PhDs at universities around the UK, including Edinburgh and Sheffield. And the one I would like to highlight today is the opportunity at the Fire Safety Engineering Group at the University of Greenwich. This PhD is about how can we harness the power of BIM in our engineering practice. You may recall episode 62 about BIM. It seems like a promising, useful tool and any development in that is much welcome for the fire community. The PhD will use computational tools like fire models and evacuation tools and will examine the data exchange requirements for them to be used together in one digital workflow employing BIM. If you would like to participate in this fully funded PhD bursary, please check the episode show notes. You can find more information linked to the application. Important thing is the date. It's closing on 28th February 2023. So, yeah, please check it out. And now back to the episode. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. Another episode on experiments that have changed the fire science. And boy, this one really did. Today I have with me Professor Hojko Ingersoll from RISE. Hello, Hojko. Hi. And Dr. Anders Lgersoll from RISE. Hello, Hojka. Hi. And Dr. Anders Lunemark from RISE, who also participated. Hello, Anders. Great to have you here. Good morning. Thank you. And you guys, you've set a fire 20 years ago, and it seems to be still burning. You have done the famous Runehammer tunnel experiments, or you were part of the larger consortium that has done these experiments. So I know that it changed the fire science because I'm dealing with tunnel fire safety and tunnel engineering, and this research just keeps popping back because it's one of the best data points we have collected as fire engineers. I really wonder the history of this program, what happened and how it happened. So maybe let's discuss why the experiments were needed, why you have went to an old tunnel in Norway to do these massive experiments, and what were the chain of events that led to this program? Yeah, I can start, and thank you for this nice introduction. and thank you for this nice introduction. And it's really, it was in the late 90s, early 2000, when we had all these large tunnel fires incidents. And in 96, we had the Eurotunnel, and we had then Mont Blanc Tower and St. Gotthard, all in a very sequential period. And I was thinking about all these fires involved ATVs, or heavy good vehicles, semi-trailers, with ordinary hazardous goods. And we knew from experience of doing fire research on warehouses with ordinary commodities, of course, these fires can be quite large. But at that time, people were talking about 20, 30 megawatt design fires. I felt it must be higher than that. And already in 1993, there was a test in the Eureka program, which was also done in Norway, where they measured for the Eurotunnel project, heat release rate up to 120 megawatt in ordinary semi-trailer with ordinary goods of furnitures of two tons. And that also somehow confirmed for me that we need to do something to show people that 20, 30 megawatt as a design fire for a truck, a single burning truck, was maybe too low. And these fires were very much in discussion, of course. And it was not a sink-burning vehicle. It was like multiple. It was 10, 15 HCVs involved. So estimation showed me clearly that this was something wrong here. So we were in contact with Christian Opsa at Sintef in Trondheim, Sintef Fire Research Lab. And he told me about a large-scale tunnel in Ondalsnäs. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. Maybe we should do a fire test there. And somehow that was the starting point. And then I went to my manager and said, hey, I want to do a full scale test in Rönnarmor tunnel. Is it okay? Yeah, as long as you find some money. And we started to find money in Sweden and we got actually up to 350,000 euros, but you need to find some partners because you have not a complete budget for this. I think you need at least half a million. So I was at that part involved in a project, a European project called Uptown. And I asked the management, can we use our part in the Uptown project to somehow co-financing these tests? And they said, yes, of course, that's interesting. I used to also add some partners here also, and we felt, okay, TNO in Netherlands, that's an excellent partner, and also Sintef in Norway were excellent partners. So they were also part of Upton. So that's how we linked into the Upton project and we're able to actually perform this in 2003. And at that time there was a young researcher called Anders Lönnemark. He was... I felt I could not do this alone and we needed help and that's how Anders became involved and really did a major impact on the performance of this test. How did the tunnel fire safety field feel after all this? Because it was like an age of really huge fires in tunnels, like one after another, like Gotthard Channel, Mont Blanc. There was Kings Cross fire, not the road tunnel, but also involving underground infrastructure. In the book, after the proceedings of the symposium, after the experiments, there's a quote that says that people lost faith in the European transport network. Did you also feel this political necessity to perform this test or was it just purely engineering driven we need a new design fire i can respond to that because i recall i was purely driven by the the knowledge of i knew there was something wrong in the numbers and also the science because we have been doing a lot of model scale testing and we could see this really clearly and that was really the background to do this. We wanted to some kind of validation in full-scale tests. So it was more science-driven, curious-driven than any political question, at least concerning me. Fantastic. And when you've entered the research, was the question of heat release rate the main research gap that you had? Or were there like immediately things, okay, we also need this and this and this, or you were just focused on the size of the fire? Yes, the heat release rate was the main driving force that in most standards, they say this 20 to 30 megawatts is the maximum. Höyker very firmly believed that this was much higher and this was of course the starting point from my participation on this research. But we also looked at other things like the high temperatures and risk for fire spread, and also the possibilities for the firefighters to fight such large fires, but all came back to this gap between the thoughts of the maximum heat release rate and what we thought was the actual case. And then of course, a scientific part of this was how to measure this in a correct way in a tunnel with such a large fire and all the practical things about just measuring the heat release rates. And the challenge was also, of course, that we wanted to have different levels of the heat release rate. So we had looked at different transport companies here in Sweden, what kind of mixtures of materials we can see there. And especially the mixtures of cellulosic material and plastics that we find out that approximately 20% plastics was quite common. And then we tried to arrange four tests with different types of those. And then we tried to arrange four tests with different types of those. That's the same percentage, but different type of mixtures and masses. So we reached different levels of maximum heat release rates, a lot based on how these were sort of ordered and how the setup looked like. Then, of course, a very big driving force was that we thought, okay, we are convinced that this is the case. The maximum is much higher than what the standards say, but we have to show it. We really have to show it with experiments. Modeling will not be enough here. We need to show this in a real experiment. I hear that very often in the fire science that something is obvious, but please give me a citation for that and it doesn't exist. There's many obvious statements that require experimental proof because sometimes when you go into arguments with authorities or some, you know, deciding parties, for them, your say as a scientist is insufficient. They want hardcore proof. Here, a really solid proof was obtained. I've read that the compositions of your fuels were, there were four tests done. Three of them had some sort of wood pallets in different numbers. The first one was mainly wood pallets and some plastic materials. The second was half pallets, half mattresses. The third was like real furniture. I guess it was Swedish furniture. Yes, that's correct. That's my guess. And the fourth one was mainly plastic cups. So that's a very interesting choice of materials. You said that it was driven by urge to have different heat release rates. But I wonder, you were venturing literally into unknown. So how were you designing these fuel sources, these experiments? And how did you even choose the number of four? Well, as I said, we want to have different levels, but we also wanted them to burn a bit differently. And our main thought was that, okay, wooden pallets, we have the knowledge of wooden pallets. It's an actual case that you see that in transportation, even if these were piles of pallets. But we also thought we need to have plastics. And what is better than to arrange plastic pallets that have the same sizes, and we just mix them in in the correct ratio. So that was the starting point. And then we wanted something to burn a little bit differently. And we also saw that, okay, mattresses is a different type of material with this being soft and it has also a different chemical composition. It was a reason to have these pieces of mattresses with the same size of the wooden pallets. Then it was the case of stability in that case, that they are not as solid. So therefore we had to arrange some practical things around this setup that we used for all the tests with some nets that it doesn't fall down. But the main thing was to have these different types of material mattresses that we thought was quite common and useful for us. The plastic cups is actually standardized goods that we use for other testing. So we had knowledge of how they burn, what kind of smoke it produces, about the heat release rate and all those things. So that was also then a guess that that would be very suitable. Then we came up with it would be very nice to have something that was real commodities. And therefore, we had this test with furnitures and we tried then to have as good mixture as possible with the similarities to others. But of course, this was different. In some cases, there was very solid packages with pieces of furniture, while others were more porous and open, so to say, in their structure. But it turned out very well, I think. Because of your famous pictures of these pallets burning in this massive configuration, now whenever I see a truck with pallets on the road, I'm immediately urged to take a picture of it and put it somewhere. I've seen three in my life already on Polish roads. It's like a unicorn, and I guess the drivers are always confused why someone is taking a picture of this seemingly uninteresting truck. Heiko, you've mentioned your experience with ordinary hazards. And as you were saying that, it clicked in my mind. I remember your papers from like 1995 where you were doing like first numerical simulations of natural ventilators. We were doing like first numerical simulations of natural ventilators. So it's fascinating how a person jumps from one field to another to completely change another field with the experience from the previous one. I wondered at that time, 2003 or even before when you were planning, you've put a big source of fire, this pallets, all the materials that Anders was talking. But you had to have some sort of idea how the fire will develop. And it was a forced flow experiment. So was at that point any expertise in how this forced flow will change the fire behavior? What were you expecting from these fires? And did it go in a different way than you expected? Yeah, when you are saying it, of course, this numerical simulation of fire events, of course, that's a part of my... But my PhD is on rock stories fires, which is a vertical piled commodities. And by accident, really, I came into the tunnel world. And I just saw the commodities on the trailers. That was just a horizontal commodity in a blowing situation, you know. It's like vertical fire spread is governed by the aided flow of flames and so on. But in tunnels, when you have forced ventilation, you create a situation where, you know, the flames and so on. But in tunnels, when you have forced ventilation, you create a situation where, you know, the flames follow the commodity, like in the Wehrhoff's fire. So there's a similarity there. But anyway, that experience, of course, I took with me. And I knew that what parameters were governing the fire spread and the rate of heat release rate. But I had also been doing a lot of model scale tests, both in Veros fires, and then I took that into the tunnel world. And actually, these tests in RuneMR tests are really based on model scale tests in the design that we did test in 2002 in model scale to evaluate what We did test in 2002 in model scale to evaluate what and how large fires, what situation they create in tunnels, like the back layering, critical velocity, radiation temperatures, smoke spread, and so on. And all that, we took that with us to the Runahammer experience, how to measure the heat release, what techniques should we use, and so on. We had experienced that from model scale tests. And then we had, of course, what really made the case for us in Runehammer and where Anders was highly involved, is planning the intermediate size file laboratory test, where we piled up, when we had decided after the survey, that's the type of goods we will use, we piled it up and took had decided after the survey that's the type of goods we will use. We piled it up and took one row of the commodity in the truck. It was like 10 rows of piles and we put that under our hood, large fire collector and measured the heat release rate. From that we were able to predict what should be the heat release rates. And that was really a very accurate prediction. And that is presented in the conference after the fire tests in 2003. That prediction, and Anders was a part of that, and what was really amazing how well we predicted it in advance, the heat release rates. Because of this experience, model scale test, intermediate size test, and then finally the full scale test. I think this is a very important parameter that you prepare large scale tests in such a way. I guess the budget was very large, so you really want to get the most bank of your euro as you can. If you can burn it just a few times, you don't want to go unprepared. From your memory, what was the number one technical challenge related to the program? What made you sleep the least? Yeah, I mean, we had a lot of discussion with different people. But number one, I would say the protection of the tunnel, because this was an abandoned tunnel with no fire protection at all. It was just a rock tunnel. And thankfully, through the Uptown project, we were able to get in contact with Promat International, project we were able to get in contact with Promat International, another Netherlands company called Gerco, who helped us to fit the Promat boards into tunnels because Promat boards are not usually used in this type of tunnel. But we found a solution and they sponsored this really. So we were lucky to get that help and for the test it was really the only possibility to do, because we would never be able to do that. And we were actually in contact with the Norwegian Road Administration, who loaned us the tunnel, in a sense. They didn't require any payment for being there. They gave us the opportunity to do this and all the environmental parts of it was dealt with with them. So we are very thankful for that as well. But the most challenging was the protection, also measuring the heat release rate where we had to, there was no fans in the tunnel. So we had to get mobile fans. So we got a German company called BIT, and we had two large industrial mobile fans for industrial buildings. And they worked perfectly. They could give us over three meters per second in the tunnel, so we were thankful for that. But otherwise, there was nothing there. I mean, it was just a pure, pure... Andes can tell you more about that, because they really... it was a hard time. So you were not allowed to collapse the tunnel? Norwegian administration that we should pay for all repairments. But thanks to this protection, we were somehow able to solve all that. But there were of course parts which fall down because we only protected like 75 meters. That's a stressful environment. Anders, you want to add something to that? Maybe tell me the secret how you've measured the heat release rate. Yes, if we start with that, the heat release rate was the main challenge, and what we have learned a lot from also after that is that we measured from the consumption of oxygen in the same way as we do in regular fire calorimetry. We made the entire tunnel into large calorimetry, but we wanted also the smoke fire gases to be well mixed. So therefore we put this measurement station very close to one of the exits, 450 meters of the fire. And there we had a large station of temperature measurements, oxygen and carbon dioxide measurements. And we have measured it in a similar way as we do in fire laboratory, but used, as I said, a tunnel tube as a large calorimeter. So far away from the fire, you were measuring the velocity, oxygen concentration, and from that, by oxygen depletion, you were estimating the heat release rate, the oxygen consumption. Perfect. So it's convenient that tunnels are one directional pipes, and if it's in a rock, it's quite tight. That definitely helps. And how did you handle the upstream? Because you probably have not known that. Well, you mentioned that you did scale research, but you could have expected some back layering maybe, or you were perfectly sure that there will be no back layering, there will be only one directional movement of air, because that would kind of make the measurements quite difficult to get if you had some smoke going front upstream. Now, our aim was to not have backlighting. Of course, we studied part for the, as I said, fire and rescue services, and their possibilities to extinguish fire was one part of the research. So we had temperature measurements upstream to see if we had any backfiring. But our aim was to have in the order of three meters per second ventilation in the tunnel. And we had to help to get two large fans, one at the entrance and one inside the tunnel, two ranges. But what we learned was that the setup itself and the fire, when it got so big, was a big resistance. So in reality, we ended up with a little bit more than two meters per second. And therefore, we also had quite significant back layering during these tests, especially the first one, which was the last largest one. I think it was a little bit of a surprise, what I recall, that we had this huge resistance. Both of us mentioned the fire, but also we had beyond the fire, there was a downhill. I think the slope was somewhere between one% to 3% or something like that. And that downhill created a buoyancy resistance to the fans. So the fans suddenly started to sound a little bit different. And we noticed our velocity measurement going down. Our velocity measurements are going down. And then suddenly in the middle of everything, there was, you know, at 130 megawatts or something, we started to see some kind of pulsations. That was a surprise. We didn't know that. I mean, there was a lot of things happening there. And I recall once, I think it was in the first test, I went into the portal on the upstream side because we had no smoke there and I wanted to see, can I see something? Because nobody was in the tunnel, of course. We had cameras and all the measurements. Nobody was in there. And I didn't see so much of the fire, but when I was coming out of it, there's a filming sequence of me coming out. I see so very, I'm like grabbing my head with my hands and I'm totally devastated because I started to feel these pulsations, you know. What was this? I felt, are we losing the control of the fires? What's happening? And I recall this so well. Really, there were definitely some surprises tell me more about these pulsations i i've seen something like that when we were doing hot smoke tests in the wosu metro and it was kind of kind of hilarious and kind of stressful because we were commissioning a new metro line that was crossing with existing metro line that was in operation and there was like literally one tunnel that was crossing with existing metro line that was in operation. And there was like literally one tunnel that was joining them together. And we were doing hot smoke tests in that tunnel. And we've seen this like pulsation movement, like every few seconds, the smoke would move back five meters, front seven meters. It was moving towards the existing operating metro stations. We were really stressed if it will enter. I guess hydraulically it would be a similar experience to yours, but yours is probably of different physical origin. So what was this pulsating movement? Maybe I can answer that because that was quite a large part of my PhD studies. When we realized that it was not just ordinary fire pulsations that you can see from liquid fires or because of under ventilation. We also can see the fire breathing to get air, which were sort of a starting point. But then we realized that the whole tube acted like some resonance cylinder in the same way as an organ pipe, for example, that you study in physics. And I started to look more in detail into this and realized that this has been studied before and was called something like thermoacoustic instabilities. And even earlier, they talked about something called a singing flame, where you had to get a sound from a pipe where you had a heating source. So what it is, is that you have the combination of a heating source of some kind that can give energy to a flow. So you need to have a flow. And then it's also related to energy to the node at that point, or if there is some working against that acoustic node in a certain point. So it's very relevant also where you place this fire. And when we started to know this, we could also calculate and see that the frequencies of these pulsations was very accurate in accordance to some of these nodes, and they interacted to give some combined nodes as well so that was very fascinating we don't know how important this is for for safety but i think it's very interesting for explanation scientifically because we have seen it as you said also in other cases these possessions where we can also have related the the fire to having tubes that was shorter which gave us another type of frequencies so that's very interesting and just if i'm not wrong you're some sort of musician right or yes you have some music i think i'd like to say he's famous for singing in ISS conferences, yes. It must have been a musician that went into the tunnel to discover thermoacoustic phenomena, and a scientist who did mass commodity tests to see commodity on wheels, to plan a commodity experiment. What fire science is a world of lucky accidents that puts the perfect people in the perfect place in the perfect time. I'm very glad all of this came together in Runohammer. So how long did it take? How long did it take you to prep the research? How long did it take you to do the burns, process the data? Was it a very long program? It was a long program and of course Höker started early in the planning and having the ideas of what to do and he mentioned also these pre-tests we did in our laboratory. But then a lot of the work was practical because this was an urban tunnel with literally nothing in it to assist us for performing fire tests. So we had to arrange electricity, the lighting, somewhere to clean up. And we used like a waterfall for cleaning up. But we had arranged toilets and some work shed to be somewhere between the tests. The protection, of course, took a long time, as Höker said. and some work shed to be somewhere between the tests. The protection, of course, took a long time, as Höker said, but then we also had to arrange machines to have something to, and tractors to move all these commodities that we were using for the tests and build up. There was a new setup for each test with steel frames, a floor for this palace to be on, of course, all the measurements to be arranged. So a lot of planning and the renting things was done before. But then in the tunnel itself, after the protection had been sort of started, we were there for like two months in the test, starting with sort of digging graves for the channels for the cables to be protected. The GEICO making the frames for the robotic board to be mounted. So they were doing their job. And in the same time, we were preparing the measurements and all the cable drawings with these long distances. And also keeping track, of course, of what cables it goes to, what measurements and all that. All that is more difficult when it's so long distances. And one very fun practical thing was no lighting in the tunnel. So we had to arrange also lighting where we were at this site, the testing site. But there were no other lighting in the tunnel. So we had to arrange also lighting where we were at this site, where the testing site, but there were no other lighting in the tunnel. So we had to have like headlamps and we had to arrange bicycles because of the distances between our work shed and the fire site. So we had to have these headlights given some kind of light where we worked. But it was a very interesting phenomenon when we came from the very light outside and take the bicycle inside the very dark tunnel. Even to have the headlight, it was for a moment before the eyes adjusted, it was completely darkness. And then we had these sort of small lights to see that it was safe. So with all of those practical, sometimes funny things, but also sometimes very difficult practical things to really arrange to make it work. And how long it took between the experiments? You said two months, but two months was for all experiments? Yes, it was approximately one month for just arranging things. And then it was a month for the test and approximately one week between each test. That's very, very quick. And how many people were involved or around? In total, I think maybe around 20, filling up the protection, all the practical arrangement with measurement and also Høyke mentioned that we have three different scientific organizations also doing different types of measurements and we all had a number of people at the site. I'm cheating because I have the conference proceedings in front of me and I found the SP Hoot test results that you've mentioned, Heike, and I see that the predicted heat release rate for pallets was 186, and in your experiment it was like 200-something. 200-202. Yeah, you remember that good. For mattresses, the predicted was 167, and that's very remarkably close to the outcome. And the cups also, you predicted 79, and it was also in this range. I'm fascinated because the laboratory tests are in free burn situation. And in the Runahammer, you've not only had a tunnel, but you had this protective enclosure that was very close to the fire. So I would assume the effects of like heat re-radiation and everything around surrounding that would be massively changing that size of the fire compared to a free burn. But it seems you did a very good estimation by just multiplying it. How would you explain that? Just the oxygen diffusion in those? No, I explained it with luck comes with skills. I mean, it was really, I always remember that we felt this need to do this in a fire laboratory. And I knew from experience in adding up, sum up, you know, knowing the rate of,, you can't get this very close. And that was really, we were quite convinced that we would get these high heat release rates. But at the same time, I think we were more surprised about the temperatures. We never expected 1350 degrees, the RWS curve. We were in the range of 1200 degrees and hydrocarbon fires like that, because we have seen this in our model scale test and in fire tests that we have usually 1000 to 1200 degrees. But in retrospective, we know that after doing calculation, modeling and so on, that this was really not surprising. You know, the thing is that we had a very good fire protection of boards, who also happens to be quite insulating. And that affects the development, of course. But also we had the ventilation, of course, create this situation, which we didn't have in our fire lab. But we know the spread between the piles is really governed by the exposed way of wind into the fire lot. But we had in our test, we had a tarpaulin as a protection initially, but that burned away quite quickly. So we had like a stream directly into the goods. So we were quite convinced that how it will spread. But the temperature definitely were a surprise here. I'm asking this for a reason. I'm wondering to what extent someone can extrapolate this fire dynamics into modern tunnels. The tunnels that I'm designing today, you know, they have three lanes. They have emergency lane. They have two meters of pedestrian walkways on the sides. They are six meters tall. They end up having like 120 square meter cross section even. Here you had the tunnel with a cross-section of 30-something when you built the protective enclosure. Do you think the size of the fire could grow to the same scale in a much larger tunnel where all these feedbacks would be lesser? With the same ventilation condition and the same arrangement around the commodity, like it was really a direct blow since the tarpaulin plastics disappeared. So we have done tests later with steel plate in front of the goods, and that slowed definitely down the fire growth rate, but the maximum heat release rate, because it's dominated by the surface area of how large areas involved. And we know that the heat release rate per unit area is quite constant in most cases, even if it's blowing at it. So the fire growth rate definitely is influenced by the rains in that high ventilated situation if you if you lower the the ventilation rate of course you will get slower heat release rate but i think it would it more controlled by the the type of how you arrange the commodity and usually in trucks you have a cabin in front or you have some kind of doors at the backside, all these things affects. So these runama tests really showed some kind of what you can expect in the worst case. It was like, you know, as you said, it was only 30 square meters in fireplace. We had this protection. We have done tests later without this type of protection, but with spray concrete. And we don't get that high as we got in the Runa test in 2003. So definitely there are parameters affecting the fire dynamics. So this is pretty much the... I like how you positioned it. This seems like a worst-case scenario. much too i like how you positioned it this is this seems like a worst case scenarios and that was what you were seeking because uh in talents i guess we should be prepared for pretty bad scenarios also uh one more question to the history straights you've also mentioned that the growth was linear that was quite interesting to me i'm i'm i'm living in the world where the fires grow in a quadratic manner. So was there something that surprised you that it was linear? In reality, not, because we had seen that in our lab test. It was also, so it's more related to how the goods is tiled. So again, it's a fuel property more than the tunnel setting property, okay? I would say it's more of the type of fuel you're using. And, of course, wind affects this. It's a wind-aided fire spread. And back to temperature. So you've mentioned you've seen this massive 1300s range temperatures that actually match the curves everyone in the fire testing industry hates because it's challenging. We have accomplished self-melting of one of the furnaces when we were attempting one of these tests for these massive temperatures. Was it only in the biggest fire or it was consistently in this range, in the smaller fires too? Well, the highest temperature was in the first test. That's where we also realized that these high temperatures were actually possible. It was relating to the type of test that was performed, but we reached high temperatures in most of the tests. But test number one was the extreme case. Why did you choose to make the biggest fire the first? If it collapses, you have the best results anyway? That's risky. I can answer that because we had a plan and we actually wanted to do a little bit smaller test in the beginning and then, you know, have some kind of final test with the largest one. We knew that this was the toughest one. But in discussion with the partners, we came to this conclusion that we should, when we have the best protection, we should do the largest fire. So it was a more practical reason. And in retrospective, it was a totally correct decision because it was a huge stress to the protection system, but it managed to keep it intact. So that was a good decision. Challenging, very brave decision. Let's move to the impact of the program. I assume you've achieved your goals. You found your heat release numbers. So how happy were you with the outcomes of this research and do you feel it accomplished what was said in front of it? overwhelming already during the test series relating both how to handle these big fires, but also the results that were high both in temperatures and heat rates and also that we have sort of reached what we thought. And of course, we realized that this is very important for the tunnel fire science and society. And that's, of course, also why we had this conference and also the results of the conference and the interest from many organizations. And then, of course, how to use this heat risk data and that can tell more about being a part of different standardization organizations and how these numbers were discussed afterwards. how should they relate to different types of scenarios or situations and all that. For myself, of course, being in the middle of a PhD study, that was an important thing. I was very lucky to partner up with Høyken in this and getting five papers out of these only four experiments. So that was very good and very interesting and very focused work, so to say. What a busy topic to have. Heike, can you tell me more about how the data was disseminated in the standardization committees and what impact on the industry it made? what impact on the industry it made? Somehow, of course, people had started to realize 20, 30 megawatt is quite low in relation to what we see in incidents involving ordinary hazardous goods. I became a part of the NFPA 502 committee in 2009. When I came into committee, the RWS curve was already there. So I assume it was somehow related to our test that made it possible to somehow use that type of information. But the 100 megawatt fire that came during my process in the NFPA committee, I think it was in, or it maybe was already there, but that definitely, it was 20 to 30 earlier. But today we talk about 100 megawatts for trucks and even 200, 300 for petrol tanks and so on. So it raised the level of the design fires. But it also started in combination with the incidents to use the fixed fire fighting system. And I think these tests really somehow proved something. But the incident also proved something. The Eureka test in 1993 also had showed us the way. So we needed to do something. And within the PR, there is, of course, also these numbers. You can see people are not willing to go up to 200 megawatt, but 100 megawatt is some kind of consensus. consensus. In the Runaway test, we only tested 3 to 11 tons on trucks, trailers, ATVs. They can carry much higher loads than that. And this is only one vehicle. We were interested in the fire spread also. And we really succeeded to show that vehicles about 90 meters away downstream, they could start to burn. Even we had a target only 15 meters because we thought in the beginning this is only four vehicles close to each other. But we really were able to show that these fires, they can jump like 50, 100 meters easily. And that's something what this has shown. But then the standardization organization, I would say, what's this, a number here is 100 megawatt and that was raised from 20 to 30. And just by that, I think we succeeded to have impact. And also the impact on the fixed firefighting industry and questions. That was my follow-up question, because in the conference paper, there are, first by Alan Brinson on the sprinklers, there are some early ideas about use of water mist in tunnel settings. So I guess once you have the proof that the fires can be this massive, the temperatures can be this high, this also opens the way for active fire protection to show how successful it can be. I guess many research further followed about the research in Spain done with different suppression systems. Can you just comment on that? Yeah, I know. I was involved in it was 2007 in a series with water mist testing and the driving industry was really the water mist manufacturer, not the ordinary sprinkler manufacturer. They have come into this later, but the water mist industry was really more unrealized the need for cooling down because the water mist is the need for cooling down because the water mist is very effective in cooling down the temperatures. And they saw it very early, the possibilities here. I think partly due to the Runahammer test, but of course partly due to what they saw in reality. I mean, with these huge fires, we can't have it like that. But somehow you need confirmation, and Runahammer has played a role in that. It was confirming something which people maybe have thought or knew. If someone gave you today opportunity to repeat that, would you do it? And what would be your number one research question today, if you had the chance? If I give you half a million euros and a tunnel, and support from Prometheus. Yeah, that is a good question. I mean, there are, of course, always need for more full-scale tests. And somehow these tests in 2003 somehow proved for us and others that ordinary hazardous material can make a singing fires in rune hammer. That's quite interesting. But anyway, I always said that my dream is to run a petrol tank fire in a tunnel. I mean, we saw in Norway 2015 that actually occurred such fire. Doing that type of fire in a tunnel is, of course, maybe getting too late because we have electrical vehicles and things like that. But I think somehow doing heavy good vehicles with batteries, I mean, all these alternatives, I think there is a time to do something there. The future will show what is the most interesting. Of course, we have a lot of debate still on critical velocity and back layering, things like that. But most of the research today is done in model scale tests. So somehow we need to calibrate again all this model scale research which has been done to more full-scale testing. So I see maybe we don't have to look for the biggest fires, but maybe we have to look for well-defined fires. And we have to go into the new alternative fuel frame for the future. Thank you very much. to fuel its, you know, frame for the future. Thank you very much. I must say I hate the modern science with these tiny model-scale tunnels figuring out, you know, critical velocity to the third significant digit and innovation coming from this time. We've put the fire sources not next to each other but one behind another, and there's a paper and another paper when they are, like, separated by three legs and five it seems more an industry oriented on publishing papers than on tunnel fire safety unfortunately that's my view on the modern fire research this is why research projects like one we were discussing today feel like you know someone opens a window in a room and then lets all the fresh air in. This is the exact type of research that fire science needs to truly advance, not just have impact factors and citations. That's what I really appreciate from your program. I think concerning how to proceed, I review a lot of these journal papers and I know exactly what you're talking about. But we have a lot of experience of model scaling, but we need to do this together with full-scale testing. Exactly. I always say you learn by model scaling, but you have to confirm by full scaling. But, you know, we have these conferences which originate from the tests in Runehammer. We had this conference, as Anders has mentioned, in 2003. And then we started this ISTSS, International Symposium on Tunnel Safety. And we have, I think, a 10 in April, we will have in Stavanger, the 10th ISTSS. And that's also a product of these fire tests, really. So it has given both us and hopefully the research community something. And hopefully ISTSS is a conference where we try to focus on science also and also on practical situations. And then this year is very conveniently organized together with Fires in Vehicles, a FIVE conference. They're like one next to each other in the same place, I think. So you can like with one trip attend both, if I'm not wrong. So that's a very interesting opportunity to visit Stavanger and learn about tunnels, vehicles, and all these aspects of safety. Anders, a final question to you. How did this program change you as a young scientist? What was the number one lesson for you as a young PhD student given such a toy? Well, if I answer the question in two ways, it, of course, changed my scientific life completely. These were a different type. I mean, I've done research before, but both seeing the influence that these results had was very satisfying, but also interest in the results we saw also gave other opportunities for Höyker and me to continue the research within the tunnel, building up a platform here that Höyker has been responsible for, very much increasing the research within tunnel and underground facilities. And, of course, the ICSS and getting to know so many other people in the fire safety society. So that was a big change in my scientific career, of course, not only getting the PhD degrees from it. So that is one side. The other lessons learned is, of course, that these large-scale tests take a lot of effort, costs, a lot of planning. There are many things that can go wrong or at least needs to be changed. But with a lot of planning and use of previous experience, you can perform these tests in a good way that they are very useful. And to sum up that, sometimes we really need these, as also Heike mentioned, these large-scale tests because they give so much extra than modeling or model scaling can do. For one thing, to convince other people, but also to be used for modeling validation later and we actually see what it is when we put on fire real large-scale tests. Fantastic. Gentlemen, thank you very much for coming to the podcast. It was fantastic to learn firsthand from you about Drone and Hammer tests. And, I mean, if you're not bored with it, I wish you continue talking about this important research for the next decade or so, at least, because it's still making considerable impact on the fire science. Finally, we would like to thank our fantastic colleagues, especially our technicians who made a great job during this test. And also to our manager, Ulf Wikström and Margit McEnvey, who have played a major role in making this possible. played a major role in making this possible. And also, of course, we want to thank to our Swedish financiers as well as our partners, TNO and SYNTEF, and at least not the Uptown project who made this possible. At the end, I would say the work from the Promat International and GERCO as well as the Thai Ventil big in Germany, was necessary to make this possible. Thanks again and see you around. And that's it. I hope you've enjoyed this episode. Runehammer, these experiments have really changed the tunnel fire science and they still make an impact today. will make an impact today. I recall, I think a year ago, we were publishing a paper with a student from Spain, Diego, and we were investigating 1D, 3D coupled modeling, and we used Runehammer as our case study for that because it's so well described, so well measured, the data is really well available. So why not using that as probably the best experiment we have? So even though it happened 20 years ago, still today, it is a very, very useful piece of research. And it was huge fun to interview the creators of that. I mean, you can learn all about the science behind these experiments from the papers, but understand how they felt, what made them do it, what were the challenges, where they had to push a little more. All of these fun things is what I try to deliver through these episodes of Fire Science Show. So I really hope you've enjoyed that. I know the experiments that have changed fire science are one of the most liked parts of the fire science show. So I'm going to produce more of them. If you have a good idea about an experiment that has changed the fire science, please send it towards me and I'll try to organize the discussion with the creators or people knowledgeable about that background of that experiment. So thank you for listening and see you again next Wednesday. Thank you. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
