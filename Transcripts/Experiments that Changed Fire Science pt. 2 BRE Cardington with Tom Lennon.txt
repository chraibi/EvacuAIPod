 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today we have a second experiment in the miniseries, experiments that have changed the fire science. And oh boy, for sure today's experiment did that. Last time we've talked about the round-robin pod of Dalmarnock, experimental programming. If you missed that, you're very welcome to catch up. And that was very impactful in how we treat modeling, how we use modeling, how we perceive modeling in fire science. Very impactful work. Today's work is something that actually led to establishment of modeling as a useful tool. As a tool in structural fire engineering. We're going to talk Cardington. Cardington is a town in the UK where BRE had its testing facility set up in the giant aircraft hangar. And in that, they have carried multiple, multiple experiments that involved full buildings, like full-scale building-size fire experiments. Not only fire, more than that, but fire is the part that interests us. Perhaps that's the first time when we've observed, when we've measured, that the response of a building to fire is a lot more than just the response of each of its parts individually. And there are effects that we should include in our modeling. That has led to development of a massive library of results that are used till this day. Like literally a month ago, I seen a paper with a new structural fire safety engineering model that's based on Cardington and used Cardington as its validation case. So, wow, what a legacy. We're talking about research that has been carried from late 80s through 90s to early 2000s. So, certainly, some time has passed, but still, it is making a daily impact on fire science. To talk this over, I've invited Dr. Tom Lennon from BRE, who has been involved with the multi-story experiments and all the experiments that follow that at Carleton. So certainly someone very knowledgeable about what happened there and a very nice person. I'm very happy that Tom has agreed to share his experience from that time with us. So I guess that's enough. There's no point to prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the Firescience Show. Today we have another episode on the experiments that changed the fire science, and in this case, multiple experiments that were carried in Cardington Fire Research Station, BRE facility in Hangar. And I have Dr. Tom Lennon with me, who has been heavily involved in many of them. Hello, Tom. Thanks for taking the invitation. Hello, Vasek. I'm so excited. Cardington is the sacred name in fire science when you enter the field, especially if you're anywhere interested in structural fire engineering. So let's jump into that. Tests were carried over many, many years in the Cardington room, from starting in the 80s through the 90s. And I wondered, first of all, how did you guys find the idea to do these super large-scale experiment inside an aircraft hangar? Maybe you can tell me some stories from the origins of the test program. Okay, yeah, I think the background to what became known as a large building test facility, so there's Cardington itself, which was the hangar, which had been there for some time. So we had a very, very large space, which was a good start. But the background to what became the large building test facility was the discussions around whole building behaviour, which was why didn't just fire contain things like issues to do with blast resistance, dynamic response, and was partly at least a function of the disproportionate collapse of the tower block at Ronan Point in 1968. And that, I think, had a big influence on some of the influential people within the BRE when I joined. And they, I think, together with government, were kind of pioneers in thinking this way. But I think the other area that shouldn't be underestimated is the influence that industry had because, and particularly at this stage, the steel industry. I think the steel industry saw in Cardington and saw in this idea of whole building behaviour an opportunity for them to demonstrate the inherent performance of the structure compared to the single elements. And this is where we maybe started to move away from standard fire testing towards a more sort of holistic robust approach but their motivations were commercial they were looking to increase their market share and particularly in the office medium to high-rise office market, which was what the first building, steel building inside Cardington looked like. We had a different objective. We were looking to develop fundamental data to understand structural performance in fire. And I came from the structure side, not the fire side. And I think that was really quite significant because the people on the fire side who had a background in fire dynamics, very clever people, but they didn't really have an understanding of structural engineering. And I think bringing together these two disciplines was one of the greatest achievements of Cardington and one which has had some legacy, I think. It's quite funny that you say this movement into understanding the building behavior in fire and using more advanced ways to determine the structural response to fire in general. When I had an interview with Professor Bobrowska some time ago, he told a very similar thing related to 1970s even, that they thought that the computer modeling will soon replace the standard testing. Then you positioned around mid-90s, had the same objective, and I would say many of fire researchers today still would have the same objective, like standard fire testing is still here, it's not going anywhere. However, I think the performance-based engineering and recognition of structural fire engineering has really changed over the course of years. Was there even structural fire engineering when you started this? Would people optimize structure for fire? Not really. I mean, it's quite hard to look back at that time and realize where we were because there's been so much progress made then and now. Our mindset back at that time, there wasn't really anybody talking about structural fire engineering. There were people who were materials experts in concrete, in timber. There were people, certainly people who were fire experts in terms of fire development, compartment, fire dynamics, etc. But there weren't really, I mean, some of the guys, some of the guys who were involved in the early stages who don't often get the recognition they deserve, some of the academics, and in particular, we were working with the University of Sheffield in the early stages, and Hank and Ian Burgess at Sheffield were really at the forefront of this working structural fire engineering. for working structural file engineering. But think about it all you like, but what you need, if you're going to develop design methods, you're going to develop numerical tools, is validation for those design methods and those tools. And that's what we were in a very, to be able to provide, is that it could be used to develop the discipline and to validate the tools that came as part of that discipline. Okay, let's build a timeline of these experiments. I know the first experiments that happened in the 1980s were related to the behavior of unprotected steel elements. I guess that predates your involvement in the Cardigan program? Yes. Or were you still? When I first arrived, those experiments, the natural fires in large-scale compartments, which was a British Steel Technical and FRS collaborative program, that was actually taking place when I arrived at Cardington. I didn't have any direct involvement. I was aware because I was involved in the structural Euler codes. I was aware of this work and it was largely with validation for the time equivalent and the early parametric approach, which eventually ended up in the Eurocode. So that was going on. But by the time we started with the steel building, which was the first building that went up inside Cardington, those experiments were complete. that went up inside Cardington. Those experiments were complete. And yeah, we moved on looking at structural behavior rather than what was going on there, which was effectively heat transfer validation. So then you moved into this multi-story building behavior, as I understand correctly. Yes. And this is the main thing I wanted to talk about today. So to give a context, you've built multi-story buildings. How big was it? Eight stories? was the most common sort of office building type that was being constructed in the city of London and elsewhere and it was designed and built as a real building it wasn't an experimental building it was designed by designers who were practicing engineers it was built by contractors who were doing this day in day out and there was nothing special about it so it wasn't a it wasn't a building designed for a specific purpose in terms of the experiments. It was designed to be a typical office building built in composite construction. And we were, like I say, we were fortunate enough to get the opportunity to work on that and to cause all sorts of damage on the building. But it did manage to survive everything we threw at it one way or the other. How did you decide how big will it be? Like someone came, let's build eight stories and everyone was okay? Or was there a bigger brainstorming behind the size and the dimensions? No, there was a design brief, which was based around city center development in Bedford, which is the closest town to Cardington. The whole purpose of the large building test facility was to move towards, as close as you could, towards reality. And that was reality in terms of what you were dealing with structurally, but it was also reality in terms of the fire and everything that went around it, including when we did the first large natural fire experiments, including things like double-glazed windows and fittings. And so, you know, everything has an impact. And if you can realistically model what is actually there rather than just a single element, then you've got a better chance of predicting what's likely to happen in a real fire event. So we were learning all the time. I think that the process was one to start from very small and to work our way up. And at each stage in the process, we were learning and improving our knowledge of structures in fire, in this case steel in fire, but we shouldn't neglect to mention we also had a seven-story concrete building and a six-story timber building within the same facility. And there were also experimental programs on fire carried out on those buildings. Like at the same time? Almost sequentially i mean we completed the main program collaborative program with british steel and some partners from europe on the steel building and then we moved straight on to the european concrete building project and i think almost straight away after that we moved on to the timber frame which was a residential building meant to be a block of flats oh and yes it's a really active period. There was also work on the Eurocodes going on at the same time as well. Timber One would be very, very popular research if you carried it today. It was quite groundbreaking at the time, to be honest with you. There are difficulties in all these projects. You can't get these things built and you can't carry out work on this scale without the cooperation of industry and so we're working very closely with the steel industry on the steel building the concrete industry on the concrete building and a timber industry on the timber building but the trick for an organization like BRE is to maintain independence and impartiality and you can work closely with them to get things achieved, but you can't work too close. You need to make sure that that is set out from the beginning and that you have different objectives and that those objectives are made clear. So I think we managed to tread that line quite well, to be honest. I guess that is especially important when you start getting negative results, like something goes the other way than someone expected it to be. Absolutely, yes. I mean, I'm working in a research institute as well, and we share the same issue. Well, I know we're talking about Cardington, but we're still treading that line now, and we're still involved in large-scale compartment tests, even though we don't have Cardington. And the same issues are still there, and the same concerns are still there. Exactly. I mean, in my view, for the industry, even if you get a negative impact from some of the work we're doing, it's better to find that out now than in a real incident, in a real fire. Absolutely that. So you have built an eight-story tall building in your facility. I guess the first thing you do is not setting the biggest fire you can get on the bottom floor and see if it collapses, but you probably want to play with the structure a bit. So how does one design such an intensive research program on such a big structure with the mind that it would be nice for it to not collapse i mean it didn't collapse eventually right no we did try quite hard but um no matter how hard we tried it stood up you're quite right and in the in the early stages the first tests i was involved in on the building were using gas-fired furnaces at different locations within the building so some of them were external some of them were internal, looking at the columns, heating up the columns and looking at the stiffness elsewhere and the restraint to thermal expansion and what that was doing. We were doing it at different levels of the building, so ground floor, third floor and seventh floor, internal and external. And we were doing it at different stages in the construction. So we went there first when it was just a steel frame and a composite deck before the floors were cast. And then we could evaluate the additional stiffness that was provided once the floors were cast. But we obviously didn't want to heat it up so much that we caused permanent damage even before the building was built. So we had to plan every stage of the experiments, bearing in mind what was coming in the future. So in the first test, we limited the temperature of the columns to 500 degrees to look at the issues of thermal expansion and restraint to thermal expansion. But then as we learned more, we got effectively a little bit braver each time and the scale of the fires increased. a little bit braver each time and the scale of the fires increased. So the first natural fire I was involved in was a compartment which was nine by six meters in area. The last one was 350 square meters which was half the floor area. So in each case we were like I say learning as we went along. So this first test on building elements that was was actually like what you were doing in the lab, with the little difference that the restrain of the elements is like in a real building, not artificial on the furnace. Yeah, that's exactly it. We're basically, instead of bringing the element to the furnace, we're bringing the furnace to the building, and therefore you don't have to have idealized end conditions, you've got real end conditions. And some of the work that was done by british steel the original restraint beam test they did very much that case of uh looking at the effect of restraint thermal expansion and contraction in the cooling phase as well and how that affected connection behavior particularly so yeah it was very much a case of build it up gradually, but yeah, that idea of keeping the structure real and then using the standard fire was one of the first examples before we went on to look at real fire and natural fire behavior. And have you seen a different behavior? I mean, that's an interesting I would love to see such an experiment nowadays. Me too. Like today, okay, today we have this fancy interesting. I would love to see such experiments nowadays. Me too. Today, we have this fancy modeling tools much due to the fact that you've provided a validation data for them to be developed, but then 20-some years ago, you didn't have this fancy finite element method for FHIR softwares. That must have been one of the first fully restrained building elements. They were loaded, right? Yeah, the building was loaded on all floors. We're using sandbags. We had these one-ton sandbags that we moved around on pallet trucks. So, yeah, there were realistic loads and there were fire limit state loads that we used that were in place. So the building was as realistic as it could possibly be. How hard was it to bring the furnace to the building? We were just talking, oh yeah, we brought the furnace to the building. We're talking about a seven or eight story building in a hangar in the middle of not a research facility. And the equipment you've used, I would say, based on my experience with equipment, I have much respect for the amount of equipment installed there. So it's not your everyday fire test. Yeah, I mean, the first thing we did was ship lots and lots of equipment from our headquarters down in Garston up to Bedford. And then one of the things we found when we got the furnaces up there, we got the control equipment, the satellite panels, all the cabling, miles and miles of cabling, got everything up there. And then we realised we didn't have any gas. So that was a little bit of an issue. So one of the first things we had to do was put in a gas line and run it all the way down to the bottom of the hangar, which was where the steel building was. And then we didn't have sufficient pressure to generate gas pressures we needed at the furnace. So we had to put a booster in and get that up. But looking back, that was a challenge. But it wasn't as much of a challenge as getting the furnace up on the edge column on the seventh floor so we had very large cranes mobile cranes in there but we didn't at that time I don't think I can be retrospectively arrested by the health and safety executive but at that time we didn't have any scaffolding in place and we didn't use mobile platforms so in the first phaser testing which was when we didn't have any concrete on the building just the metal decks it was very easy to trip over as well the columns came hinged and you basically brought them in around the column closed them up and then did the bolts up the side and the only way we could get the bolts up was by one of my colleagues who's very strong thankfully holding my ankles while I was draped over the side with a spanner and tightened tightened them up that's seven stories up on the floor so yeah I mean I certainly wouldn't do anything like that now but that was some of the issues we faced we were faced with because none of us to be honest and nobody else had done it but no none of us had been involved in work on that scale in terms of fire testing so it was was new to all of us. The second phase, we bought a big mobile platform with us and it was much easier to live and learn. I have similar stories, but I'm much more liable than you for 1990, so I will choose to not share them here. But that seems to be a shared mentality between fire scientists who really love what they're doing. How many people was involved in that, like dozens, hundreds? No, no, I worked with a very small group, a very accomplished group of guys. So I had a couple of guys working for me who were basically involved in cutting and drilling and fixing and lifting and shifting i had one guy who worked with me for years who was in charge of the instrumentation and he was absolutely fantastic because it's difficult to appreciate in this building say we were testing one column then we were instrumenting that column on every floor and a column one bay away in each direction on every floor with strain gauges top and bottom high temperature strain gauges in the area we were heating normal strain gauges outside displacement transducers and that was without any temperature measurement so um and rotation transducers as well so So the actual logistical issues were enormous, and we were a very small but very efficient group working together. And we worked there for about 10 years, to be honest, so we were quite good at it by the end. I guess even data management would be a hell. I see it to be a trouble. If I was to design this today i would struggle with with data management data logging even with modern computers and fancy little data loggers that you take here to your pocket and and go with them our ones were heavy they were quite big but we used uh we used a series so you could slave different additions to the main logger we had but we had typically around about a thousand channels of data for each test we did. And all that data had to be analyzed afterwards and needed to be secure and identified so we could identify the position of every single instrument. And yeah, it was quite an achievement, particularly back in that time. Any video recordings of these fires or was it not popular back then? Yes, we had professional video recording done at the time. Any video recordings of these fires, or was it not popular back then? Yes, we had professional video recording done at the time, but that was all done on VHS. So I don't know what happened to it. I mean, we worked alongside British Steel, and I think they probably made more effort than we did to actually capture the video images. Because, you know, afterwards, there was the idea of selling what you've done effectively and taking this out on the road. I remember going to one meeting in, I think it was up near Manchester Airport, and I had to travel with a television and a VCR. So I needed like a massive car just to get the telly and the video recorder in. I don't know what's happened. I've still got some videotape, but I don't know what's happened to the originals. In my office, I have a videocassette from BRE with compartment fire tests. And I was like, I've shared that image on Twitter some time ago. And people were like, oh, my God, this is the holy grail of teaching fire. So, yeah, you can get a lot of VHS, all videos. And today we learned when doing our large-scale experiments in modern times, we really appreciate the knowledge you get by just observing and recording in multiple angles. You can really learn a lot from just this video image. I think structurally it's the most important thing, actually, to be honest. I mean, we've just finished, this is slightly off-kilter, but we've just finished a fire experiment we did last month. And in terms of the evaluation, the insulation, we need the temperature measurements for. But really everything else you can do through visual observation. So powerful. Great that you did record. I haven't really seen much recordings from Cunnington, so I wondered. But it's good to know that they are there. Maybe we seen much recordings from caddington so i wondered but it's good to know that they are there maybe we should send some indiana jones to the british steel archives and then dig them out and then yeah yeah i mean we're used to at brv we used to have our own v department and they were they were professionals you know i mean so um the quality of it would have been very good nice okay so let's move from the furnace test into natural fires. So tell me, what was the reason you wanted to see natural fires in these multi-story buildings, and how did you plan out the experiment on its own? Okay, I mean, I think that side of it is quite clear. I kind of mentioned in the early days we were working alongside our colleagues at British Steel, and there was also a partnership with the Colm Steel community. I think it's RFCS now. But there was a European project involved but their motivation was mainly commercial to sell more steel to make the steel industry more competitive. Our main objective was to understand structural behaviour in fire and And to do that, we had quite a good understanding of structural behaviour because that was our background, but we needed to understand fire behaviour. And this was something for compartment fire dynamics, it was reasonably well understood, but the impact on the structure wasn't. But from our side, on the structural side of BRE, we didn't have much experience of dealing with fire looking at design fire parameters and I learned quite a lot from some colleagues at FRS at the time fire research station but what we were trying to do was look at effectively realistic fires and most fires don't actually develop post-flashover. Most fires are dealt with in the early stages. And we had one situation where we built this realistic compartment for the first corner fire test, which was a nine by six metre compartment with plasterboard linings and double glazed windows. So we lit the fire. We had, I think, an opening, but a very small opening. And surprise, surprise, basically the fire went out and we didn't have sufficient oxygen. Because we'd had discussions with colleagues, we were aware that this was potentially going to happen. And we'd spoken to the fire brigade who were on hand at the time and said, OK, if we get to this stage, what you're going to do is break the windows. And I don't know if you've ever tried to break a double-glazed window with a fireman's ladder three-story up in the air. Not that easy. So I was sitting there watching this ladder bounce off the window, bang, bang, bang, thinking, oh, my God, I've just wasted a quarter of a million pounds or whatever it is, and we're going to get nothing out of this. But, thankfully quarter of a million pound or whatever it is and we're going to get nothing out of this but thankfully they did manage to break a pane and then we had fire developed itself it was sufficient oxygen it was preheated we had a rapid flash over and then we had a full-scale fire test that was my first experience of natural fires and now I always make sure that there's plenty of ventilation and that we don't end up in that situation a second time. I would like to scout now what was the ground at the time. In the documents about the design of these experiments, I've read that the test was very influenced by Broadgate fire, which was a building fire in which the building did not collapse. Absolutely. But then again, some years ago, there was this famous Ronan Point collapse, and I think there were other buildings that progressively collapsed in fires. So I guess it was not obvious if a building can or cannot collapse in fire as just an effect of a fire. Yeah. Because the Broadgate survived, right? I think Broadgate was, as far as British steel was concerned, and the European steel industry, I guess, was the critical issue. The Broadgate fire, I think, was in 1990. So that was just predated what we were doing here at Cardington. But if you relied on standard fire resistance test data, then you would have predicted a collapse of Broadgate. then you would have predicted a collapse of Broadgate. And the issue, because Broadgate, I'm sure many of your listeners will know, but it was a fire that happened during construction and before the fire protection was installed. So you had unprotected beams and columns, unprotected connections. And although you did have significant deformation, you had no collapse. And the idea was that the inherent resistance of the structure was different to the inherent resistance of a single element. And I think there were some some people with a lot of foresight at British Steel at the time was a chap called Jeff Robinson, who was fundamental in developing the program from the British Steel side. And I think they saw Broadgate a an opportunity to demonstrate this whole building behavior which i mean there's two sides to whole building behavior i think it's very important to recognize this you've got the beneficial aspect of restraint got alternative load carrying mechanisms such as tensile membrane action but it's not the only one but you've also got alternative failure mechanisms which maybe could be things like connection failure because we don't test connections instead of fire testing so you've got to look for both i think you have to look for the beneficial effects but you've also got to bear in mind that if you look at a real situation there are detrimental aspects to whole building behavior as well and like like I say, we were literally learning as we went along because we were starting from a very, very low base in terms of understanding. But the kind of speed with which we learned because of this work was really something quite incredible, I think. So by the end of the process, by the time they closed Cardington down, I think we developed to be effectively have a very good idea of how real buildings behave in real fires. And how many experiments in the multi-story you've burnt? Oh well I mean in on the steel building there were I think in the original scope there were like six large, four of which were natural fires. But then we came back later in 2003 and we did another one, which was with University of Prague and some guys from Portugal as a collaborative program. But then if you were to include the natural fire safety concept test, which weren't on the steel building but were on the same floor area, there were another eight full-scale tests there. We also tested two large houses, steel frame houses on the same area, and we tested some hollow core floor slabs in the same area. And then we went to the concrete building and we did large-scale testing on the concrete building. And then we went to the timber building and we did large-scale testing on the concrete building. And then we went to the timber building, and we did large-scale testing on the timber building. And we did additional work on modular systems. So it went on and on, to be honest. It sounds like a lot of hard work, but I'm kind of jealous to hear someone was given the opportunity to work with so many. I feel very fortunate, Wojciech, to have been there at that time with those people who gave me the opportunity and gave me the responsibility to be involved in that work. I feel very, very fortunate. Right place at the right time. Okay, so moving from the furnaces to natural fires, how did you define the natural? What was the source of the natural fire? I see cribs on pictures, so I guess that was it. Generally timber cribs because the behavior is quite predictable and we know what we're going to get. I mean, it's a way of getting, as far as we're concerned, it's a way of getting temperatures you want into the structural members. That's all it is. It's a means of loading. That's how we saw it. That was the difference between us and the fire scientists who preceded us. To us, we considered the fire as a form of loading. And then how does the structure actually react to that load? So we were looking to provide a realistic but also predictable thermal input to the structure. And we kind of relied on the design methods for compartment time temperature response that were available at the time and we actually, I think, we actually helped to refine those methods as we proceeded with the experimental work. But the natural fire test was something which was realistic in that it was not a standard fire exposure. It had a cooling phase. It had a cooling phase. It had a growth phase, a very rapid growth phase generally, and it had a steady burning phase. So, yeah, the idea was to have something that was much more realistic than the standard fire exposure. And did you ignite like one crib and then allowed it to naturally spread through the room or? What we did, I mean mean the biggest one was the 350 square meter one what we did was we connected all the cribs using channels which the channels had fiber strips which were soaked in paraffin and then we'd light the paraffin strips because we had quite a number of cribs in there i've actually seen some of the videos from the large compartment fire test and it's a little bit frightening when you see the video i was in there with a colleague and we were walking together down the line just lighting strips as we went along and then eventually we walk out the door and the door's sealed but when you see which i wasn't aware of at the time when you see the flames coming over your head because it's a very rapid fire development and yeah if i'd known what was happening i would have moved a bit quicker but yeah we we are always even nowadays we're looking to cut short the growth phase so the early stages of fire are massively important for people who study life safety massively important but for people who are interested in structural response the early stages are not so important what matters is when you get to temperatures that are going to have an impact on the structure. So we're trying to accelerate that growth phase to an almost instantaneous flashover. I would actually challenge that with a modern approach, traveling fires and stuff like that, where we see posing part of the structure to a preheating conditions where a part of the structure might be exposed to 200-300 degrees for a prolonged amount of time, especially if protected with typical means. On the fire situation, when the fire eventually comes to that point. So obviously the travelling fires are something that happened in, let's say, the last 10 or 12 years. Well, I mean, travelling fires either in, let's say, the last 10 or 12 years? I mean, travelling fires either happen or they don't happen. They weren't invented in the last 10 or 12. It's either a phenomenon or it's not. I mean, I have certain views myself. I think what we were looking to do was to provide a fire that was realistic. Now, that realistic fire will change if you change the geometry of the compartment. So if you have something like the natural fires in large-scale compartments work, which you mentioned earlier, where you've got a very long, effectively, corridor with a ventilation condition only at one end, then I have absolutely no doubt that you will have a traveling fire. But that's a function of the ventilation condition and the geometry and possibly the ignition source. It's not necessarily something which is going to happen in all cases. Well, it's not going to happen in all cases. We know that. And I think we are not sure at all about where the transition is. So for me, if you were looking to evaluate the response of a building, which was a very long, narrow corridor, and you put in a fire that is like that and you set light to it and what you get is what you get. If you get a traveling fire, fine. If you get a 1D post-flashover compartment, it's fine. But I don't know enough to know where that transition is, and I'm not sure who does. that transition is and i'm not sure who does of course i don't think anyone knows exactly where the transition is uh i there's a reason why we have ongoing research on so many places around the globe but at the moment what i wanted to point out is is that well that there's an evolution you know of of our knowledge and your piece was an important part in the middle of it we're still evolving and maybe someone in 30 years in a holographic podcast will say, oh, these guys did very primitive method. And now we finally understand the structure of behavior, right? But you've started with standard fire. So natural fire is a major, major improvement. How did you control the ventilation? Because I know a lot of effort was, I think it was the later tests in which you were assessing the natural fires in terms of how they rank. Yeah, I mean, it depended on, effectively, it depends on the job. So the early ones, we didn't really control the ventilation at all because we were looking to get something which was realistic. However, when British Steel did their natural fire, or the first one, they actually had a green which was movable, so they could alter the ventilation condition. So they had one ventilation condition for ignition, and then once you'd actually developed the fire, they changed that ventilation condition to follow a specific curve, because they had a slightly to follow a specific curve because they had a slightly different objective to us and they were looking to generate particular temperatures in the steel. I think for the work we did for validation of the parametric approach in the Eurocode, ventilation condition was one of the parameters we were looking to investigate. ventilation condition was something we was one of the parameters we were looking to investigate so we had different ventilation conditions within fixing all the other parameters to try and ascertain what that was so in that case obviously we are manipulating ventilation for a specific reason but in the first natural test you just like open a window to have enough oxygen inside to ignite it and then they would fall out or you started with a completely open wall? I don't know if I've mentioned this one already on the discussion, but we did have the issue with our first compartment test where it was a double glazed window and to end up with a fire brigade breaking that window. We were aware that that was a potential issue because we'd spoken to colleagues in FRS who were more at that time more expert in fire development and they probably said well you need some ventilation and say yeah yeah yeah but we want to do this because this is how it is and there were two kind of conflicting aims so we started with one way but we said to the fire brigade if this happens can you break the window and they said yes we can and that's what happened. But then the rest of the windows would be damaged damaged by the fire yeah once you had that initial because you had a preheated compartment effectively once you had a fairly small influx of incoming air it quickly took off and the whole lot came out they were aluminium windows frames so they just melted and the whole frame came out but yeah i mean other situations we've had large compartment tests, we had, I think, a third of each elevation that was unglazed and then two thirds that was glazed on either side to represent an opening condition. But we know the behavior of glass in fire is quite unpredictable, to be honest, and it can vary during the course of a fire. And were you looking also to the external effects of the fire? during the course of a fire. And were you looking also to the external effects of the fire? I don't know, the extent of external flaming or the damage to the building infrastructure or anything related to that or not? No, at this stage and for some years after we'd finished at Cardington, I don't think there was much effort expended at all to look at the impact of external fires in terms of cladding fires. There were issues to do with external flame spread away from a building. And we were measuring, in some of the experiments, we were measuring heat flux away from a compartment. So that was a factor that was considered. But I think it wasn't, unfortunately, it wasn't until many years later that there was a proper attempt to bring together fire engineers and structural engineers on external fire spread. There were a lot of research questions anyways. I guess you had your hands full of work anyway. Yes. I mean, we were starting from scratch, basically. It seems strange because it's a long time ago, but it's not that long ago. But the actual state of knowledge in terms of structural fire engineering, not fire dynamics and not structural engineering, but bringing the two together, it was kind of revolutionary, to be honest. Okay. And between the tests, let's say I see these hugely displaced beams and slabs, like actually massively displaced, but they are still there. Were you trying to fix the structure between the experiments or you just moved the fire to another location in the building? How did you approach the structural damage? Yeah, I mean, I think I mentioned before there was an incremental thing so we're gradually getting more serious, actually getting larger, so we didn't start off with the biggest fire because we might have been. We did also move around on the steel building. We did move around different locations. And that was kind of planned originally. When we came to do the final test in 2003, which we ended up with the biggest deformations, actually, I think a metre deflection on the floor slab. That's a metre deflection in a slab that's spanning nine metres. So, you know, you're going downhill like like this you know um i can imagine that yeah yeah and and when it came to doing that one there weren't too many areas left that were unaffected so um we weren't exactly spoke for choice about where we tested and the building was still standing beautiful it was yes it was uh when when. Okay, let's talk a bit about the effect this research had, because you have done it not only for fun, as you mentioned multiple times, contrary to the industry, you wanted to understand the behavior of the building in real fires, natural fires. So, first of all, which gap you wanted to fill, and you think, in your opinion, you have successfully filled the best with these tests? Yeah, I mean, I was aware of what the original objectives were of the programs I was involved in and the European programs. And a lot of that, I mean, it wasn't for a start. We didn't set out to determine a new design method. We were out there to a new design method. We were out there to understand what was happening, but we were specifically looking to provide validation for numerical models. And I think on that side, we achieved the objectives, and I think we probably superseded our objectives in terms of what actually came out, in terms of the understanding, in terms of what actually came out in terms of the understanding, in terms of the new design methods, particularly for composite construction and tensile membrane action. And also, again, it's hard to go back. When I was involved in the first natural fire experiment, we had some of our colleagues in Europe did some modeling to predict the fire behavior. And they came out with peak temperatures of 600 degrees in the compartment and now you probably yourself you think well that's ludicrous you know you it's it's going to be somewhere around a thousand maybe above whatever but um we didn't have anything to judge that by at the time um and i think by the, we produced sufficient data for not just for structural models, but also for thermal models. And the work we did, I think, on the validation for parametric approach in Eurocode 1 was also something which confirmed some of the problems they've been in the past and the importance of things like lining materials on fire development and the importance of maybe different types of fuels and how their plastics and timber or combination of timber and plastics, how they are involved. So we were doing both on the structural side and on the fire development side. I think we made some really great achievements, to be honest. And it was a collaborative effort. There were lots of people involved in this. Nothing like this happens unless there's a lot of people involved and a lot of people contributing. And I worked with some fantastic people over the period I was working at Cardington. For the parametric model, you've not only validated it, but you've considerably expanded the limits of its use. Because you could apply it to 500 square meters, you've changed the insulation, you've changed the opening factors for which the model was validated for. Yeah, I mean, you're based in Poland, I presume, for sure. Yeah. I mean, we have in the UK, we have our own national annex as well. And there are still some areas where we have some differences of opinion between those in Europe and those in the UK. And I think it's important to maintain that expertise within the individual countries so we can have some choice in these areas, I think, where we think we maybe have a slightly better way of doing it. And for the foundation of the structural modeling software, I guess you guys were delivering the data and experiments and it was other groups. Can you tell us about who was doing that? At the time, I think we were working with TNO and CTICM and certainly what was Arbed or Arcelor now. And all those guys were involved in numerical modelling, some of them using Diana, I think, British Steel, and when the University of Edinburgh came on board in the latter stages, I think they were involved using Abacus. But we were also, the formulation behind the eurocode was also done by the same guys who were involved in developing SAFIR so like I say it was it was both on the structural end and the thermal side I think we were providing that location across the board and this now one way or another all this all this data was made available I think British Steel put some big efforts into making sure that this data was made public. Still is. So anybody could use it. And so even if you weren't involved with somebody with a model, then somebody with a model could use our data. I will link in the description to that because I find it actually astounding that 20 some years after this happened happened it still is uh shared it still is available the data is it's in a pristine form it's very clean you don't wonder where this transducer was there's a lot a lot of effort in labeling everything i really appreciate that as someone who's doing uh fire experiments because that's the annoying part of the job you know watching a fire burn down the buildings is the annoying part of the job you know watching a fire burn down the buildings is the fun part of the job of course yeah yeah probably the most stressful in the end but the fun part but uh labeling uh well i i had one guy working for me a chap called nick petty who was my sort of chief instrumentation guy and he loved it so uh that was his passion. You won the jackpot then. Yes, absolutely. Makes work so much easier. Okay, Tom, we're heading to the end of the podcast. So maybe I would love to ask, how did the program change you as a fire engineer? You're still practicing fire engineer. I guess you still come back to the experiences from Cardington and and still use them in in your ongoing efforts right yes i was i was quite young i just hadn't i'd come out of university but i was a little bit older because bre paid for me to go to university i was already working i just come out of university when i first took over on the structural fire side and then very shortly afterwards I ended up at Cardington and it has had a major impact not just on my career but on the way I do things, the way I work and I mean I do lots of other things now so we do site inspections, we do assessments, we do all sorts of things but we still do large-scale testing. And I think what it's given me is, and anybody who's been involved in this area will know, an ability to organise because that's what you need to do. The thing I brought to it was getting things done. There were people much more clever than me at the beginning who were saying, Tom, go and do this. But I was able to get that done deal with the contractors do all the project management all that side of things that needs to be done and i think anybody who works in large-scale fire testing knows how difficult that is to actually get from the drawing board onto the fire and get the result you want in the end and have all the information available so i think it's had a major impact on the way i work I would say a lasting impact. Having all this experience would you do it again given the chance? Oh a drop of a hat yeah I would it was I mean it was in terms of work-wise I'm very happy with what we're doing now it's it's a very good and a very productive period for me and the guys who work with us but I think that probably was the best time of my life in terms of being able to do that and being so fortunate to be in the right place at the right time. I just took a quick look on the Google Scholar and the book from the multi-story experiments has been cited 276 times. Even this year, it already has been used as validation for new models. So the ongoing impact is tremendous. And thank you and Bure and British Steel and everyone involved for that. This is certainly one of the experiments that changed the fire science. Yes, indeed. I believe so, yes. Okay, Tom, thank you so much for this episode and this insightful journey to the Cardington. And I hope to see you around, maybe to talk a little more on structural side of engineering. Of course, thank you very much for the invite, Wojciech and I hope you get on well and I've actually instigated now within our team. Every time we have a team meeting we're going to watch one of your episodes afterwards as internal training. Great, great great policy thank you so much my first choice was danny's one so that's the next one we're gonna look at good he'll he'll be very happy to know that thank you so much and that's it boy what a legacy at the cardington amazing research program and it even took me significant amount of time to understand the timeline of what was happening there. Because these guys have done so many groundbreaking experiments. Like saying you are talking about Cardington is not saying enough. Because there have been so many experiments that changed the fire science. You have to be more specific than that, I guess. That's a lesson I've learned after this episode. I have to be more specific than that, I guess. That's a lesson I've learned after this episode. But I'm very happy to talk with Tom about the timeline and all the history of discovery that happened at Carthington. I guess the next step for you is to jump into some reading, and I've linked some resources from Carthington. Happily, there's a lot of stuff available. There's a lot of data preserved at different sources. So very easy to get, very clear and very useful. And that would be it for today's experiments that changed fire science. And I hope you've enjoyed this interview and you enjoyed the mini-series. I have more of this coming. If you have in your head an idea about what was an experiment that has changed via science, let me know. I would love to talk about it on the show. So, yeah, thanks for being here, and I invite you back on Friday, I think, where we're going to post the question and answers episode, a bonus episode for November. It's going to be published in December, though. One in which I'll answer the listeners' questions that I got. I hope that will be interesting to you. And back to normal cadence on Wednesday, where you will learn more on fire science, actually structural fire engineering again. And we're going to talk timber. That alwaysites everyone thanks for listening see you bye this was the fire science show thank you for listening and see you soon
