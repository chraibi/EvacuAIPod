 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, Session 60. Today I have a topic that I would classify under interesting, relevant, maybe even sexy. It's a topic of fire safety for whole-tire installations on flat roofs. Certainly a very, very relevant issue and we've seen a lot of large fires of such installations going through the US and in Europe as well. And regardless of these fires happening, there's not that much research going into this subject. So certainly the efforts of my today's guests are very much appreciated, or maybe not that much appreciated by the PV industry, but certainly appreciated by the fire industry. My guest today is Jens Christensen, Dr. Jens Christensen. He just defended his PhD at the University of Edinburgh with his research being performed both at Edinburgh and at DTU in Denmark, where he's currently. It was a great effort on investigating why or how such roof installations could burn. And I really appreciate that soon into his earlier research, he realized a very specific complexity in the system and pursued that until he got his PhD, researching this complexity and trying to understand how this complexity changes the behavior of the roof and panel system, considering them both together, not separately, which is a huge distinction from how our industry often operates. And this podcast episode will tell you a lot about the safety of photovoltaic systems, but also a lot about how our systems operate. So without further ado, please join me with Jens and let's spin the intro and get into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy Science Show. I'm today with Dr. Jens Stiemann-Christensen. Congratulations on your viva, Jens. Thank you very much, and thanks for the invitation to your fantastic show. Really happy to have you here, and we're going to discuss, surprise, surprise, your PhD topic, which is the photovoltaics and fires. And I must say, you have a very interesting twist on the flammability or fire behavior of photovoltaic panels. I really like your approach and the way how you studied, but we'll reach that point, why it is so interesting from my perspective soon. First, please tell me, what made you start incinerating photovoltaic panels? Is this a hobby from childhood to burn things up? No, maybe. I wasn't one of the students in physics who tried to ignite everything, but I was probably not one of the ones behaving the best either. With the photovoltaics, it started when I was a master's student at DTU, the Technical University of Denmark, where I had my current supervisor, Kondo Jomas, as head of studies, it's called. And also, he was one of the guys teaching fire safety engineering. So there was only three courses at DGU in fire safety engineering so I went to him and I said do you have more courses within fire safety engineering and he said yes we can do individual courses so I had an individual course which went well and then at some point IF Insurance who is an insurance company of IKEA contacted Kunde to ask hey do you want to be a third party on some experiments related to photovoltaic panels on flat roof constructions, which IKEA have a lot of? And yeah, I was the third party on that. And IKEA was happy with those experiments or my report. And that turned into a master thesis afterwards with some large scale experiments. And they were quite happy with that as well. So we continued with a PhD and got the two insulation companies, Kingspan and Ruffball, on board as sponsors as well of their project. So it's been a long journey. Now I finished the PhD, and it looks like I will continue working on the topic. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Usually people after their PhD, they don't want to see the subject of the topic. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Usually people after their PhD, they don't want to see the subject of the matter. Yeah. You know, to be honest, I think the subject is still interesting. I did not answer all the questions. I still think it's a very extremely relevant topic. And I do know that I'm one of the few people working on the topic. And if I'm able to continue raising awareness of the issues related to the PV installations on roof constructions or in the built environment, I think it's to some extent necessary to continue. I think what makes your work really unique, and this is obviously your advantage or your achievement as well as achievement of your supervisors grunde and the whole project is that you look at the holistic setup of the pv panel and the roof whereas the manufacturers of pv panels or many other bodies would look would look solely on the on the fire performance of the panel itself or you would look solely on the fire performance of the panel itself. You would look only on the roof itself, whereas you try to understand what makes the way how the panel is placed on the roof change the fire conditions. And I think it also places your research in this universal area. You're not really connected to any TV panel manufacturer. The insulation, of course, you did research on certain types of insulation because that's what you had access to, but it's also fairly universal in terms of the properties of these materials. I think it makes it really interesting. What was the point when you thought it would be interesting to look at the problem from this perspective of this semi-enclosure, as you name it, point of view of the PV panel, instead of just going simply, let's put a shitload of PV panels into cone, rank them by flammability or something? Yeah, well, that's, I guess, almost what I started doing. rank them by some ability or something. Yeah, well, that's, I guess, almost what I started doing. That's the reason it's been such a long journey. I remember some of the first stuff I did was taking a PV panel, trying to cut it up into 11 by 11 centimeters of squares. And cutting a glass panel is quite tough, I can tell, in all cracks. But I did it. I put it in a cone. I tried to ignite it. But I also realized that the backseat of the PV panel mostly is a fluoropolymer, which has a very high thermal stability and a very low heat of combustion when it's finally ignited. And the amount of combustible materials in a standard PV panel is extremely limited. It's around 10%. So at that point, I started considering, is the PV module actually a fire PV panel is extremely limited. It's around 10%. So at that point, I started considering, is the PV module actually a fire load? Or what is it actually that's burning? So what we did then was the steady state experiment where I had a gas burner, and then I measured the heat flux as a function of distance to the gas burner without the panel. And of course, the heat flux is reduced as a function of distance, which is quite obvious. But then we installed a PV panel above it and played around with the inclinations and the gap height. And we only published a limited amount of that. Of course, I did not continue with, you know, I didn't do that many experiments as it was powerful by master teachers. But at that point, at that point realized that okay the deflection of the flame below the pv panel actually increased the heat flux significantly towards the surface below and because i only had access to few panels i wanted to i repeated the same experiments with a panel which had been used for one experiment and then i reused the same panel. So I used a panel where part of the backside membrane was burned away, and thus there was no combustible materials left on the backseat. And at that point, I realized the panel itself is probably not a fuel load, so I have to look at the system behavior rather than just the individual components. And that's how we ended up continuing, all looking at the system rather than the individual components. Because what is the panel? It's a bunch of glass, silicon, plastics? Yes, it's a glass mostly, in general. But it is a glass panel, two to three millimeters thick. Then there is an aluminum frame on most panels to stabilize the construction. And then you have the silicon cells, which are non-combustible. Then there are some metals, relatively limited as well. Then you have the backseat, which is, you have the cells encapsulated in EVA, and then you have the backseat, which is often a fluoropolymer. And that's it. Then you have a junction box and you have the backseat, which is often a fluoropolymer. And that's it. Then you have a junction box and you have some cabling, of course, the whole infrastructure. How heavy is the square meter of a panel? You must have lifted some of them. Yeah, more or less standard panels. One meter times 1.7 meters. And the weight is 18 kilograms. So it's 10 kilograms per square meter. Even if you consider that all of it goes into fuel load, that's still not very much of a fuel load. And if you say that it's approximately 10% of it, which is flammable to some extent, that's not a very big fuel factor. And then, on contrary, we see these large fires of these roof-installed facilities. There was the famous case of Walmarts in the U.S. It was a very medial case where I think it led to the removal of some of the photovoltaic systems from their buildings, or at least that was the intention at that point. I don't know the details. So, indeed, even though it's such a small fuel source, there is in the public space some risk associated with that. I assume your research was going into the system approach, into looking how the panel changes the fire dynamics of the roof itself, and not just treating it as an additional fuel. That's pretty smart. What about ignition? Because you mentioned you've put the fire underneath the panel. So you did care about the fires that are within the roof and then the panel is an additional factor or fires that would originate in the panel and then... What was the point? Yeah, we had several, you know, there's several sources of ignition. There is, of course, an external source of ignition, which we cannot control what it is. There was a large fire in Norway in, I think, 2017, in a cooling facility. It's named as the Esco Fire, A-S-K-O. So the largest cooling facility in Norway, but there was a forklift catching fire inside the cooling facility, and the fire broke through the roof. But what happened afterwards was that the fire propagated along below the solar panels, along the roof, and then spread into a different fire compartment. So certainly the compartmentization of the facility was breached due to the installation of the PV panels. But mostly, you have of course the external cases of ignition, and then you have the PV system itself, which is a direct current system, which you can discuss whether the installation practice and standardization is good enough, because the standardization of the PV module itself is quite good. It's the Electrical Institute International. I can't remember. Senelec, it's called in Chile. And then you have all the infrastructure. One of the main issues, there are several issues. One of them is the connectors. So the connectors that you use to connect each panel, but also to connect series of panels into parallel system or connect them to a combiner box. Because there is a lot of connectors, which there are several manufacturers, but there is no standard. So you have the de facto or default standard, which is Stoutly, which is a company, a multi-contact MC4 connector. But you have a lot of connectors from different companies which can be assembled with that connector. But it's not designed to be assembled. It can be assembled, but it's not designed to. So that means with time, resistance will build up in such a system. And with resistance, you'll have production of heat. And with production of heat, you'll have more resistance. And at the end, you will have an electric failure and you'll have a direct current docking so at the moment you can commission your roof it's a certain performance because it just works but after time it can build up this failure yeah and then you can look at density yeah and then you can look who are allowed to install the pv systems in the different countries If you look at Denmark, where I am right now, you do not even need to be an electrician to install a large direct current system on a roof construction. It's only an electrician, certified electrician, who have to connect it to the AC side of the building. All of the rest of the system, you know, you don't need anything. And what about the roof itself? Like, roof is to some degree combustible. It just has to pass certain tests to show it does not spread too much. Can you bring me in line, like, how we test roofs and what we expect from roofs, at least in Europe? Yeah, so in Europe we have the EN13501-5 test. It's called B-Roof. And as long as it's what it's called, compliant with B-Roof, then you're allowed to install the roof construction. B-Roof, there's four different test methods because it's Europe, and we do not really agree on how to test stuff. So there is test 1, 2, 3, 4, which are different from country to country. So France have their test stuff. So there is test one, two, three, four, which are different from country to country. So France have their test system. Germany, Denmark, I think Norway, Sweden have their test system. The UK, of course, are different, so they have a different test system. But in general, all of these tests are designed to verify that a fire does not spread along a roof or propagate along a roof. And that's also what we see in the experiments is if we have a mock-up roof construction or if we have a roof construction, in general, I can go to the nearby IKEA, I can start a decent bonfire because the roof is designed not to facilitate spread of fire. Which doesn't mean it does not burn at all. You know, it burns because mostly it's part of fire. Which doesn't mean it does not burn at all. You know, it burns because mostly it's plastics. Mostly it's PVC or bitumen or TPO or EPDM. There is different materials that are also plastics. So all of these materials are plastics. There is just a decent amount of flame retardants in it and thus the fire are not able to propagate. You will have ignition, but the amount of heat that's necessary to heat up the next part of the roofing membrane to release a certain amount of paralyzing gases cannot be released from the burning paralyzing cell of the burning roofing membrane. So eventually the fire dies out because it's not able to produce new fuel. Yeah, it's just quenched. And now comes you with your PV panel, and you put a PV panel on top of that, and then the fun starts. Yeah, and then the whole system changes because you have what's called a heat feedback loop. So because of the barrier, which is above, which can be to some extent a vertical barrier, which either deflects the flame, so you have deflected flame. That's almost similar to a concurrent flame, if you talk about concurrent or opposed flame spread. So you certainly have a higher amount of heat flux radiated towards the roof below, and thus you have a significantly higher heat flux towards the area, and thereby the design of the roofing membrane, if it's designed based on with the flame retardants, cancel out the whole system. But in your legal systems, you're not obliged to repeat like B-roof with the PV panel. No, it's just you're putting a thing on a thing. It's two different things. First of all, the fire safety in Europe, when it comes to the PV panels or building applied PV panels, which this is, that means you have an existing building and you come with your technology and it's just an add-on technology. And that add-on technology has, in most countries, nothing to do with the roof. So you don't have to consider it for fire safety. Here in Denmark, we had the issue. It's been asked, like the ministry has been asked, what do we do about this? Well, it's not a positive building. It's not our problem. And different places, as far as I understand, in Europe, they have different point of view. But it's not really standardized anywhere how to design it or how to consider it with respect to the design. And on the opposite side, the people doing the PV panels, they would be responsible for the PV panel itself. So they can show it's low flammability, it's low risk, we're not adding fuel to the roof, you're good. Yeah, it's a perfectly fine panel itself. And that's what they're saying. So they, first of all, they don't want to hear the word fire. You know, I don't have many friends within the TV industry. And the funny thing is, I honestly think I'm trying to ensure long-term sustainability of their product. So we also install them in 30 years from now because that's what I'm honestly afraid of. If we do not do or act right now, we will have an issue in the future. And then we might have politicians who are doing what politicians are best at when it comes to not understanding the issue. And that will be banning the product from the built environment and utilizing the roof constructions for PV systems is the ideal way to utilize. Yeah, it's a very well-exposed surface. So give me the technicalities. Give me the meat. So what exactly did you find? What's the number one finding of your extensive research in beer burning these semi-enclosures? I think, first of all, it is the definition of what we call the semi-enclosures, what Guillermo Reyn and Ricky during my virus said, like, it's just a cavity. It's a semi-enclosure. No one understands what it is, but I continue calling it a semi-encl closure until I finish the editing of my thesis. So, first of all, it is the identification of the simming closure and the importance of the re-radiation, the whole system behavior, which is crucial for the fire safety that we had, experimental setups, we identified a critical gap height, where the gap height is above a specific gap height. So the gap height is defined as the distance from the roof construction to the PV module at the point of ignition. If the gap height is, let's say, 13 centimeters in this specific setup, the fire do not propagate at all. But if we lower the module one centimeter, certainly the fire starts to propagate to the whole roof construction. So it's very, very small details which define the difference between no flame spread and flame spread. This gap height also relates to the truly rate of the source, right? Sure. To some extent, we need to define what is the worst case scenario source of ignition. Because, of course, if you have a low heat release rate, you will also have a low flame height and thus the distance to the panel itself, the PV panel above might be larger and thus the flame does not deflect below and the fire cannot propagate. So there is some relation there between flame spread and no flame spread. Well, that's an elegant solution if there's a critical gap height that allows you to fully benefit from this. Yeah, but the issue is as some people said, it's a deal with the devil, right? Because if we then have a relatively high gap height on a flat roof construction, we'll have issues with wind load or load from snow. So it's a whole system. We also talked, I talked with Ikea, my contact person there, about how about adding more flamer tops or how about using thinner roofing membrane. adding more flammable tons? Or how about using thinner roofing membrane? The problem is if it's a thinner roofing membrane, because if it's a thinner roofing membrane, the fuel load is smaller. So certainly you don't need such a high gap height because you have such a limited amount of fuel that you cannot heat up. You don't have enough time to heat up the material in front. But based on my own experience as a wind engineer, I'm not sure if the wind issue would be so significant when you raise the panel like 10 centimeters higher. You see the – let me give you a background. Yes, you're perfect. Why I know this. Yeah. I know this because we've built a wind tunnel. And when we build a wind tunnel, we've started having customers who come to us and tell us, guys, I am selling PV panels or I'm selling this PV installation somewhere. Or I'm doing small car park buildings covered with PV panels. And I need to tell my customers that this product is safe in case of wind. It does not, it's resistant to wind. So, can you put my PV panel in the wind tunnel, like blow 20 meters per second on it, and then tell me it's safe. And we're like, you see, you have, again, it's a very similar case to what you've realized. You've taken the product out of the context of the building. So, when you have wind blowing on your PV panel and the walls of the PV panel are sealed, like the large surface where you have the PV panel inclined is not porous and you block the other wall. Okay, yeah. So the wind cannot go from the other side. Yeah. you block the other wall, so the wind cannot go from the other side, it's going to push your panel into the roof. And even in very, very strong wind conditions, it will not create enormous forces on the panel, not destruction forces. However, if you frame the same thing on a flat roof, you have a giant warehouse, which can be like a few hundred meters long. You put a flat wall on it. You have a corner of that wall. What happens when the wind is attacking that building, a huge vertices form at the edges of the building, like a giant of vertices. And because it's a vertices, it's rotating. So at one point it's pushing down, on the other point, it's gonna go up, so it's gonna be sucking your panels. And now, the force created by this is at a complete different level, or it can be times 10 of what the panel would feel when it was isolated. So it's not really a problem of the panel. It doesn't matter if your panel is 10 centimeter taller or not. It matters like where versus this vortice it will be on your roof. And that's also like such things. That's one of the reasons it would be like ideal to have the PV industry involved in the project as well, as a collaborator, rather than someone who's not really a big fan of what we're doing. I've applied for some of their conferences, and I haven't been accepted so far, but I really hope that they do understand that I'm there to help them. Yeah, if you have a solution for the flammability, maybe you don't have a complete solution, but you have a solution for flammability, maybe you don't have a complete solution, but you have a pretty good idea where the solution may be and how to significantly reduce the added complexity that comes from this system. And wind engineering has very good answers why this can be actually done, contrary to the popular belief that it cannot be done because of wind or some other mystical forces. And the issue is all the different ways you can install them. So on a flat roof construction, you can have them like mechanically fixed, but you can also just have them ballasted on the roof. Yeah, I often see them just weighted with layers of bricks. How common is that? I don't know. I don't know. It depends on the owner, but I do understand why they prefer just to ballast them, because then you don't have to penetrate your roof construction with metal screws, and thereby the roof is intact. And the roof is there to protect against the elements, water especially. So you don't want to make holes in something that protects from rain, of course. So it's interesting that we are seeking the solutions and I believe that what you have found through your research is a very elegant way. I also saw in some other papers of yours with Malaysian colleagues, you have been investigating how often this fire happens. Yeah, yeah. I also found it very interesting. Can you comment on that one? Yes, yes. So the team in Malaysia actually started with a paper manuscript and asked us if we wanted to participate on that. And we adjusted it here and there and recalculated it. So as it says in the paper itself, it's quite – the amount of data is sparse. And the quality of the data is limited. But it is all the data we have access to. And someone has to do the first analysis. So we analyzed those five sets of data in total and realized or found out, calculated that an annual frequency of fires would be around 29 fires per gigawatt capacity. So that's equivalent in a country like Denmark, that's 29 fires per year. If you look in, then you multiply that with 300, 320, you have the amount of fires in the European Union. How much is a gigawatt of panels? That's like a field, not a building, right? That's like the whole, a gigawatt is the whole capacity in Denmark. So a large roof construction, commercial roof construction, could be one megawatt, two megawatts if it's like extremely big. So that's the scale and the like domestic installations is a few hundred kilowatts as far as I remember. So that would mean for a like large building the fire frequency would be like one every 25 years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And for household installation, like one in 500. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then again, we have to remember, first of all, the quality of the data. Some of the data comes from the Italian fire and rescue services. If you look at the data, Italy has a significantly higher amount of fires per year than any other country. But that's because the Italian Fire and Safety Services are actually looking for those fires. They're actually reporting those fires. So you have more or less the actual number. Whereas there's other countries, if you look in the States, they have maybe 20 fires a year because it's not really possible to report these fires. There is the report by McManee and Brian Mercham on green attributes to buildings and build environments. And it's really highlighted that, well, it's just not possible to report this kind of fires. Then there is also different systems in Germany or the Netherlands. fires. Then there is also different systems in Germany or the Netherlands. The amount of fires which are actually reported is just based on surveys and media or social media. So it's just if there's suddenly a fire in the media, they write it down. So the definition of fire here is a very large fire. Then it's actually reported, whereas smaller fires are not reported. So what we look at might actually only be the tip of the iceberg, whereas all of these smaller fires are not really highlighted anywhere. It would be ideal to get some data from the insurance companies, of course, because they will have, they probably have all the data. Then It's just a question of sharing that data and their willingness to share that data. And since they have not shared or mentioned the data or questioned the numbers that we came out with, one could think that they are lower, but we don't really know. So collaborating with them and having access to their data or just feedback based on their data would be a huge benefit for understanding the risk related to PV systems in the built environment. Going back to your study, you've mentioned gap height being the variable that you found really important. Any other things you found that influenced this behavior? I don't know, inclination of the panel? Yeah, inclination surely affected it as well. We didn't do that many experiments with inclination because we had too many parameters. But when we inclined the panel, the critical gap height became larger. The flame spread rate was higher. So that was also quite interesting to see. So quite interesting to see. Then we had some limitations with the width of the setup, which limited the flame spread length, unfortunately. But I think I had to rebuild that experimental setup and do it a bit larger. And then we might be able to verify the behavior. But in general, we verified the behavior during my master thesis with some large-scale experiments, which I think published in Fire Technology. with some large-scale experiments, which I think published in Fire Technology. And you also mentioned you've worked with manufacturers of insulation, so I guess you were changing the roof membrane itself a bit. Was it an important variable for you? The membrane was the same. So the insulation was the variable because there were insulation companies, like Kingspan and Rockwell, a few huge competitors, but they were quiet during the whole thesis. Congratulations on working with both. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an achievement on its own. Yeah, but they were really great to work with because I think they, to some extent, accepted they were on the same project and kept quiet, so that was great. So there was no significant difference, in my opinion, between the two insulation materials I worked with. I did not test them at the same thickness. You know, one could say I should test them at the same thickness, one could say I should test them for the same R-value, the insulation capacity, or how well, the conductivity. And of course, the conductivity of the peer insulation from Kingspan is lower than the conductivity for the mineral wall. And in addition, the Kingspan product does also have an aluminum foil on top. So during the experiments, that actually benefited the P-insulation. But the issue with the P-insulation is that it swelled when it was exposed to heat. And that part of the insulation would swell, did not have any conductivity, or it had a very high conductivity. So the conductivity tested for the material, you know, in the standard test methods was not representative when the material was exposed to heat. But in these experiments, we had 60 millimeters of P insulation, and the fire did not penetrate it. And for the mineral wall, we had 50 millimeters. It should have been the same, but yeah, that was what they supplied me. And the differences in panels, how were you testing different PV models? I tested a few different PV models which were supplied, and they more or less behaved similar to all of them. One of them, or two of them, actually, was dripping. So when it exposed the heat, it started dripping. There was burning droplets, and the droplets continued to burn when they hit the surface or hit the floor. Of course, that would be an issue if it was a vertical installation. But right now, when it's a horizontal installation, it's not such a big issue. Also because the files are not spread outside the array, so an array is like a group of PV modules. That segues me to the region where we're going to start hypothesizing. Yeah, yeah. And what if the roof was inclined? Yeah, that's a good issue because also what kind of materials will you have on a roof which is inclined? If it's tile, then it's probably not such a big issue. But if it's still a material which can burn, then of course it would be an issue also because you'll have flame spread, even to a higher extent, be similar to concurrent flame spread. So you'll have upwards flame spread and you will have the deflection of the panels. So yes, that will be a significant issue. And it's a big trend, you know, photovoltaics are a huge trend and you see them everywhere. And it's not only roofs now being covered, I see facades being covered with PV panels. panels. And in the facade settings, this brings us to good old cavity issue, like it was framed by your examiners on your Viper. So we're technically creating a cavity system with somewhat combustible cladding. And not to mention an increased probability of ignition. As if cavity fires were not a big problem, we now have one that can ignite itself. Yeah, yeah. And the issue here is that these facade mounted PV modules is different from the building applied systems, which I've worked with. So what I work with is you have an existing building, which is a building itself, and you apply a system. But when you use it in the facade, it's what's called a building integrated PV system. So certainly the PV module replaces a component of the building. If you remove the PV module from the facade, you have to replace it with another construction product. I'm pretty sure I saw, at least in here, PV modules that were literally glued to existing facades. Okay, okay. Then it can be a different system. And a facade that would be amended with PV panels. I guess that brings us to a complete new set of unknown challenges and risks we may not even be aware. And in this case, the spread rates may be, they will be completely different from what you've reported. be completely different from what you've reported. But also, hopefully, the membrane is also better than on the roof because of the standards we have for facades. Mostly, it's like a ventilated facade in most of these systems. And the interesting thing here is because it has to, in most cases, has to be replaced with a construction product if you remove it. It's tested as a construction product. So there is existing test methods. It's accepted to be part of the whole fire safety system or regulation. The issue now is how do you put a PV module into the existing test systems? It's really interesting. So you would consider a facade in a very different way than you consider the roof. Yes, yes. On the roof, you put the thing and it could be okay because you just put the thing on the roof. On the facade, you fiddled with the facade itself, which is a system which... That's an interesting point of view. But then you can question, does the test methods, are they representative of the real world? And especially when you include the module in the test system, are you able to entabulate or are you able to, can you actually fit that PV module in or will you do it differently from test center to test center because no one really knows how to fit the PV module into test methods or into the existing framework. But, you know, if it's approved and it's compliant with the standards, then there is no issue. Fantastic. That's a whole world that opens. And if we want a sustainable future, these are the issues us fire engineers and listeners of the podcast will face, as if there was not enough issues around. And my last one, I also saw these interesting solutions where the photovoltaic panels would be put inside the glass tiles that you would put on the roofs. What are your feelings about that? It's interesting, but then you exponentially increase the number of these connections that you've mentioned previously as the ones that worry you the most. Yeah, yeah. You know, with time, you're able to implement it most places. You'll soon be able to implement it in a standard window, more or less transparent. And of course, we should do that. We just have to figure out the issues related to that technology and what unexpected consequences are. I'm not sure at the moment that I understand the complexity of such systems. Right now, I'm working with one specific system. And of course, with time, hopefully, I'll be able to understand more complex things. So I guess that's also why I enjoy, if I'm able to continue, which I'm quite sure I will. So yeah, there is a lot of unanswered questions. There's going to be a lot of work for us. I say that in almost every episode, but that's a good career path. At some point, you know, I really hope someone will join me just on trying to understand the issue. So I'm not just, you know, Jens Stegall working with photovoltaics. So there is actually more group. Yes. And I don't matter if it's just, you know, if they are grouped with me or if they are somewhere else. It would actually be nice if they're at a different university. Of course, then you'll have some, you know, constructive feedback and criticism saying, Jens, you're not right. thank you. Thanks for criticizing my work. That would be great. I hope you will get a lot of messages after this episode. Maybe someone will significantly disagree with you. That would be perfect. Yes, thanks. In like two weeks, you're having your public presentation of your PhD thesis. Will there be a stream or something? That's the plan, yes, yes. I'm not sure if people following the stream will be able to ask questions or not at the moment. I'll have to figure out, but I'm quite sure there'll be a stream because maybe... What day is it? August 19th. August 19th. One o'clock. August 19th, one o'clock. The real time, and for anyone living not in Denmark or Poland, you have to figure out. Yeah. Good luck with summertime. That's fantastic. I'll make sure that this episode airs earlier than that. And people who are listening to the podcast, you'll get a better experience with pictures and the technicalities of the fire problem that we have just discussed. And if you're listening to this episode long after that, and Jens is now a professor and a well-known scientist. I will not. I will leave you, must I? Well, then if he's just a playboy billionaire living off testing photovoltaics, I'm sure there will be plenty of resources available online to catch up with. And I am sure, Jens, this topic will not be outdated in five or ten years from this recording. That is for sure. Hopefully the topic is. Maybe someone found a smarter way to do it, and I'll appreciate that. But I'll continue with DBI here in Denmark, working with their team, and see what comes in the door. It looks like there is already some PV stuff and they have some very great labs and a great bunch of people. So that's going to be really good fun. Okay. The future looks bright and once again, congratulations on your PhD. You rarely see examiners being excited about their PhD thesis they just reviewed. And yours were. So that's a good sign that it's a great piece of work. And I've been reviewing parts of that as your ongoing reference to publish. And I also enjoyed it. Yeah, I think I've been very privileged to have a hot topic, so to say. A topic which is just my own topic, and it's very extremely relevant. I think everyone with that topic would be able to write a good thesis, because it's just a funny or interesting topic which is highly relevant. And when you know that your topic is applied or people are interested, then you try to do your best. So I guess that's it. That's it. Okay, Jens, thank you very much for coming to Fire Science Show and all the best in your future journeys with photovoltaics and beyond. Thank you very much, Wojciech, and thanks for the invitation once again. And that's it. I hope you really enjoyed the episode. I must tell you the podcast doesn't tell a full story of Jens and his research and obviously something private to him, but I admire his insistence on doing this, his passion for fire science and seeing how amazing research because the research he's done is just really good. It's good on himself. Seeing how it has been done in the circumstances he was going through, the forced change of location, health issues, and stuff like that, it is amazing what this guy has pulled off. So, Jens, I'm really, really happy with you're a full doctor now, and your research is really good. The variables that you've identified as the most important in the process, I am sure they will lead to forming solutions. So your work is not only good, but also is going to get applied. And most of all, I'm in a way disappointed with the systems that we've shown in this episode. Maybe you remember the episode with Anya Bullinghouse where we discussed the differences between the bus and train industry in terms of how they treat the reaction to fire of upholstered furniture in the vehicles. I have flashbacks to that episode in this episode. Because come on, if we consider the roof and TV panels separately, they're great. Together, they're somehow dangerous or bad in a way. We need to consider systems as systems, not as a bunch of parts, because then we often miss what's important in making them safe. And this is the important message of the episode. I mean, we have this in many ends of fire and fire engineering. And we really need to learn how to think systems, not products, not items, not elements, systems. So yeah, with this thought, I'm going to leave you till next Wednesday, where we're going to have another great episode. This time, I'm really going to deliver the glass. I know I promised it this week, but it's in the pipeline. And I'm sure you are going to thoroughly enjoy that one as well. So if you came here for the glass, you've received three panels. I guess that's also good. And the glass coming next week. See you then. See you next Wednesday. Thank you. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
