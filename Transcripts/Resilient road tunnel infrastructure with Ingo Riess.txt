 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show episode 40. It's kind of difficult to record this in a cheerful manner when there is a war next doors, like literally in a country next to mine and we've been called paranoid about Russia. We are Polish people, but now you see what we were afraid of. Anyway, let's hope for the best. I can only tell you that the Polish nation is extremely supportive to the Ukrainians, both in terms of supporting their military efforts and at the same time supporting those who escape from Ukraine and this mainly women and children. And I must tell you observation that's really surprised me. There is hundreds, if not thousands of young Ukrainian males who are working in Poland, who are on their way to the Ukraine to fight. If that's not being a hero, then I don't know what is. Anyway, let's not make this podcast political. Let's go back to fire science. And I hope to some of you who are disturbed, this will at least let you escape the reality for some brief time. Today I have a guest that I wanted to invite to the podcast for a long time, Dr. Ingo Reiss. Ingo is an engineer working with road tunnels and tunnels in general. And to me, he's one of the biggest authorities in terms of engineering tunnels. He's not a researcher, but he surely acts like one. I love that. His experience with designing tunnels, performing risk analysis, one-dimensional ventilation analysis, and just being a part of an effort to design some of Europe's biggest tunnels, his experience is immense. And I was looking forward to that talk because I myself am a tunnel engineer lately and we've been involved in many, many road tunnels in Poland. So this episode was as much for me as for you. And I've surely learned a lot from that. It's a good one. You want to listen to the end. So let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. I'm here today with Dr. Ingo Reiss from Lease Engineer GmbH. Hello, everybody. I'm here today with Dr. Ingo Reiss from Ries Ingenieur GmbH. Hello, Ingo. Great to have you here. Hello, Art. Thank you for having me. I want to do this for a long time. I mean, you're a fellow tunnel engineer, which is probably the closest part to my heart now in the fire engineering world. the fire engineering world. And I must say the resources you provide in your papers and the reports that you participate are priceless to me. So I loved the opportunity to talk to you like face-to-face. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Okay. Recently, I came a report that you've participated on on the resiliency of tunnels that was done for piark and i saw you're doing a lot of work around the topic of resiliency of tunnels and actually i would love to start with that because that gives us a better impression of why we should design safety in tunnels and how to design it so So maybe let's start with defining what's resiliency in the world of tunnels. That's a rather difficult question. I know. I'm in a working group of PAYAK. In the initial meetings, we tried to find a definition, a common definition of resilience, and this was really difficult. And it had to be revised several times. For a tunnel or for a road network it's about keeping traffic moving and if there is a disturbance to the system to get back online as quickly as possible. So the resilience is the measure of the possibility of keeping the network or the traffic connection open from any adverse impact. And if the connection is broken, to get it open as fast as possible. Like the ability to restart doing normal operations as quickly and as little cost as possible, right? And there's always the aspect of safety. little cost as possible, right? And there's always the aspect of safety. If the tunnel is broken, you can always open it if you accept any level of safety or unsafety. I like the goal of the tunnels, to get the traffic moving. And yeah, we build them. Now, in Poland, for example, Poland is not a very mountainous country. We have mountains in the south of Poland, but it's not a part of huge conurbations or something we have their connections with our neighbors but now i'm mostly involved or highly involved in tunnels being built in cities in large cities as a part of like giving the city back to these citizens and that's a trend that's been here for ages. If I remember correctly, there was this huge fire safety program, Memorial Tunnel, and that was connected to a large project like that, I think it was in Boston, USA, where they tried to move a highway. That was Boston's Central Artery, yeah. Yeah, and that was like 30 or 40 years ago. And the trend is now in here, and we start digging under the cities. We start building these huge tunnels for large volumes of vehicles. And this approach is not going anywhere because it seems to be successful. And with this growing demand for tunnels, growing traffic volumes in these tunnels, and the modern view on safety, which is unfortunately triggered by huge tunnel fires we had in the past. This project seemed to be increasingly challenging, at least for us in here. Like the expectations are higher and higher. And I'm not necessarily saying that the targets are higher because the target was always for the tunnel to be safe. But the solutions to provide that safety are increasing. Is that something you observe as well? I mean, you're designing tunnels for quite a while, I guess. My impression is that it's a pendulum. So after the large tunnel fires, we had an increased demand for safety. And the government put up a lot of money to increase tunnel safety. And right now it's swinging back a little bit. In Central Europe, we've got these design codes. So everything is pretty much defined and it wouldn't decrease much above that. On the other hand, there are tendencies to accept a higher level of risk for reduced cost. So at the moment, it's more like possibly going away from these prescriptive codes to risk analysis, and in that way to accept more risk for particular tunnels or infrastructure objects. But do you think you can really compensate that in risk? The bottom line is that if you allow for heavy vehicle traffic in the tunnel, any heavy vehicle traffic, you will eventually have a scenario where there is a large fire in the tunnel, like very large fires. Even like for me, cutting probability by half or one third, it doesn't really make such a big difference because still you have this scenario. I know it may go from like 10 to the minus of 5 to the 10 to the minus of 6. But is this a big enough change in probability or risk to allow significant cost reductions? The argument in Switzerland is that you could save money in your tunnel and you could spend it elsewhere for road safety. So the tunnels are inherently more safe than the open road in average. So accepting more risk in a tunnel gives you additional funds to solve accident points, risky points on the open road network. That's the argument. And the truck fire or the dangerous goods fire in the tunnel, you have to weigh it against a dangerous goods event on the open road. So we had this discussion again in another country, another project where we discussed dangerous goods in the tunnel. And then the argument was, what happens if the accident is not in the tunnel, but in the residential area above ground? So in the end, it always should be about risk. But the problem with risk is when you are in performance-based design and then it's a question how do you prove that you meet the requirements and how do you prove that you are on the safe side i like the two cases that you've made one is that the whole road system is is one body and you can holistically approach it especially that in most countries i would assume there is some governmental authority that manages all of it. It's not like a bunch of private tunnels of competing companies. It's mostly one network in a country. And if, in fact, you do free funds in one project to improve safety in another project, that's fantastic. And the second thing you've mentioned about the fire or the catastrophic event happening, if there was just a road, not a tunnel. And you're right. It's from my experience also, it usually would be worse in a tunnel, at least for the people around that location. And this is a very difficult thing to convey to the communities that live near tunnels. Yeah, well, it's the European approach that the whole network is operated by the government. But there are numerous countries where especially tunnels are built and operated by private entities which have contracts with the road network operator. And this makes the concept of resilience rather complicated because the operator looks at his object, his piece of infrastructure, his tunnel or bridge or whatever, and he wants his piece of the road network as resilient as possible. But the network operator may not be interested in that. When you have the urban road network around that, if the tunnel is closed, the traffic capacity will be drastically reduced, but the connection will not be closed. So it's not such a big issue as for a tunnel like Mont Blanc or that's really connecting countries and would require a detour of 100 kilometers. It's a different perspective. Are you a network operator? Are you a tunnel operator? Or are you the driver just wanting to get from A to B? And from your experience for this private project, is this capacity to restart the tunnel, this resiliency reflected in the design? Because for us, as you mentioned, in European, we have standardization and codes and good practices that we usually follow and we're usually limited to that. So is this resiliency a design factor that you would design for? Would you spend more money on the tunnel systems to improve that? Would you install sprinklers in the tunnel just for that reason? Resilience is a rather new concept when it comes to tunnels or road networks. Let's stick to road networks. It's a new concept, and so far I think there aren't too many examples where really improvements have been made for resilience. But the effects are already noticed. In 2016 and 2017, there were rather similar fires in a road tunnel in Germany and in a road tunnel in Austria. And the German tunnel was equipped with a foam fire suppression system. The Austrian tunnel was not. So the Austrian tunnel had a fully developed fire. The tunnel was closed for, I think, just about two months, and the German tunnel was closed for about seven or eight hours. So that's resilience. But then you have to consider how much money are the two months worth. Is it reasonable to install such a system, to maintain it and test it and operate it just to get these two months of operation every 20 years. And that's a discussion that's only starting right now. I think that in most existing tunnels, this has not been investigated. For us, this is in a way problematic because in our law system, which is very prescriptive, like it gives you these certain requirements your tunnel must pass to be allowed to be built. There is almost no ways to include benefits from like extinguishing systems. You cannot install a system and decrease the fire resistance of your walls or don't do spalling protection on your walls. You cannot lower the capacity of your exhaust system. You cannot change the design fire scenario. Maybe you can, but it takes a lot of effort to do that. So if you are not required to install it and you want to install it, you know the benefits are there, but it's difficult for you to benefit in your design. That would allow you to loosen some other requirements. I don't necessarily agree with that. As an example, in Switzerland, we currently design and started to construct the second tube of the Gotthard Road Tunnel. And this is, in principle, a resilience measure because it increases safety because we've got unidirectional traffic in both tunnels in the end but first we have to close the existing road tunnel for a couple of years months at least and there has been a study made on what to do while the tunnel is refurbished. And there were several options investigated, like temporarily using the old rail tunnel, like using the detour across San Bernardino, which would mean several hundred kilometers of detour. And the study calculated the societal costs. So it was not investment against investment, but it was societal cost, including environmental impact, including increasing accidents on the open roads. So all this was investigated. And in the end, the government decided, well, it's well worth building a second tube to increase safety and to reduce the impact of the tunnel closure. So this was a cost-benefit analysis covering the 30 years, 50 years of tunnel operation. And the government decided that it's worth including these societal costs. That's public money. That's private money. It's not money the government saves directly. So if you have a more global view on your infrastructure, it may be well worth for the government as a road network operator to increase resilience. I think it's a discussion we need to open in Poland with our road operator. They seem to be open for discussions in fields like that. And I think the points are very strong that you have to look beyond just the most basic costs of your system. We have not even mentioned life safety yet in this discussion, because it's self-evident that if you install a sprinkler system or some other technical means, you will also improve the life safety and operational capacities of the fire brigade at the same time. But this is something that is fundamental. It's a standardized approach in Switzerland. You have to do this type of, it's a defined procedure, this cost-benefit analysis, and you have to do it for every project, every new tunnel, every refurbishment project. And the Gotthard is not the only example. There's the Belgian tunnel, which is one of the main traffic arteries in Switzerland, which is now getting a third tube for the refurbishment of the existing two ones. And there will never be all three tubes open to traffic. It's just a temporary measure for the refurbishment to have another tunnel tube. And it's the cost-benefit analysis shows it's worth to do that. It's better than closing the tunnel for a couple of months. That is astonishing. It's really the question, how do you value the time spent for the driver meets on a detour? How do you deviate the traffic? What's the impact there? And in the end, the cost-benefit is positive. That is astonishing. I wanted to drive the discussion towards refurbishment because I also know that in Western Europe, like in Germany, or I assume in Austria and Switzerland as well, the tunnel network is actually quite old. You guys have been digging these things for hundreds of years, almost. I think that the median age of a railway tunnel in Germany is above 100. So that's quite a challenge. I wonder how you approach, like you mentioned now that the third tube, which is for me, exotic and amazing concept to build for resiliency but how you approach like developing safety and resiliency when you get into a tunnel that's 100 years old and you have to work with what you have there there's no general approach first you have to that's these are the most interesting projects for the designer of course first you have to see what is what's there and what can you do with it and is it possible to upgrade it to current standards or do you have to deviate from that because of the stuff you have to work with. We have ventilation systems conversion from transverse fully transverse concept to longitudinal concept or longitudinal with local smoke extraction then you get different pressure forces on the false ceiling so do you have to strengthen the false ceiling or do you have to reduce the flow rates or do you have to change the concept do you change your fans from fixed blade to variable pitch do you there are so many options what you can do, but you have to analyze each project. It's intriguing. You said transversal into longitudinal. There are a couple of tunnels where we remove the false ceiling and use the full cross-section for longitudinal ventilation when it's unidirectional traffic. There are projects where part of the false ceiling has been removed to make room for jet fans, and other parts are still used as a cable tunnel or cable duct. It's the kind of work where you as a designer can become really creative. I'm asking that because in here we have this assumption, and I'm not sure where it came from, that a transversal system is universally better than a longitudinal system. And I have worked with transversal system is universally better than longitudinal system. And I have worked with transversal systems, and I'm not necessarily convinced that is the case. Probably when you have bidirectional tunnel, that's the only way you can go to have safe conditions both sides. But if the traffic is unidirectional, I really don't feel that improvement. By fully transversal, I mean distributed fresh air and distributed exhaust air. I mean, we've got the local smoke extraction with the dampers, and this is used in new tunnels, in new bidirectional tunnels of a certain length. But we found after the large fires in Europe that the distributed exhaust doesn't really work. You have to have local extraction and you have to have airflow control in the tunnel using jet fans to control the flow velocity. And these control algorithms are still challenging. They are used in Switzerland and Austria for a long time now, and they work pretty well. But still, in my opinion, the requirements are not very well defined. We know where we want to go. We want to have symmetric flow, or we want to have a reduced flow velocity if there's no smoke extraction. We don't go for critical velocity. I love that. critical velocity. I love that. But it's currently these control algorithms are defined as you have to get to that target and you have to get there within, say, five minutes after fire detection. But I think that that's not enough because sometimes it's better to approach to do it slowly and not use all the jet fans in the tunnel. And today there are jet fans, there are tunnels where when the fire is detected, all the jet fans start. And these designers, I think, forgot that the reason why you want to achieve that target of maybe 1.5 meters per second, you want to maintain smoke stratification. And if you switch on all the jet fans in the tunnel, you don't have any smoke stratification. So the measure defeats the objective. Exactly. I love how you segued me into the next question I wanted to ask you. You've mentioned symmetry conditions at the ends of the smoke control zone and some assumptions behind the flow management, like starting all the jet fans at the same or controlling that in a better way. And a lot of that comes to these unrealistic assumptions or ideas that we go when we model tunnels. If you go into a project with a tunnel and you simulate it or you check other simulations. There's usually no traffic because it's a hell of a problem to model traffic along a CFD. Or even if you did, it's not really reliable because small change in traffic will result in large change in the simulation outcome. So you would have to run some Monte Carlo properly to get it right and you cannot afford that. You usually start with the initial conditions like zero, zero velocity and no movement, static field. Then you start your fire, which is a beautiful buoyant plume that touches your ceiling, flows both directions. Then you start your fans and they disturb it. You don't usually consider metrology, like the weather conditions outside, and not even touch the mistakes people do in the simulations with the grid size or boundary conditions. But this initial image is so different than what you would see in a tunnel where you're in one. We have a tunnel with a bus stop in the middle of it in Warsaw, and if you go there, there is definitely air movement in there, not to mention that noise is unbearable, but the air movement is always there, and it doesn't magically disappear when you have a fire. So your initial field is already unidirectional air movement that will make a lot of funny things to the smoke and i'm doing these simulations and i'm doing it like everyone is doing because otherwise i would not be able to explain to the stakeholders why i done it differently and why it's better maybe i should try it one day we'll see I think it will not go well but you know, there is something with this that we put so much focus into super detailed analysis where the initial conditions are just plain wrong and I feel I'm doing it wrong are you doing it wrong as well? I think I never had to do CFD design CFD simulations for tunnel design really? I think for a few projects we had to deliver it, but this was more about jet fan, jet impingement on traffic and things like that. But I never did a fire simulation. I always avoided that. And today, when I'm working on a project, I have someone else do it. I'm not really interested in this. When I see the fire life safety reports for these performance-based design projects, they do it, as you say, they use FDS and they use standard boundary conditions, still air as an initial condition, no traffic movement. And they have an egress model showing that everyone gets to the nearest door. And, well, you have the two scenarios. You have the unidirectional traffic, which is boring because the result is always the same, and you have the bidirectional tunnel where things get really messy. The result is always complicated. So what I would like to do, at least in the initial, I mean, it's really a scientific level of CFD. If you start with moving vehicles and moving boundary conditions and dynamic flow conditions, that's not standard stuff you would expect in a design project. But what you can do is you can combine the findings from this kind of steady state CFD 3D modeling with a dynamic 1D model. So you combine how realistic you can prove, show how realistic or unrealistic are the boundary conditions. And then you have to make an interpretation, which is difficult for the client because he wants to see the numbers and the pictures. What does the smoke do? But I think that would be the right way to go. You think that in this field, 1D modeling or the network modeling of tunnels would be superior to CFD because of this capacity to model multiple scenarios versus a nice three-dimensional flow field in a CFD because of this capacity to model multiple scenarios versus a nice three-dimensional flow field in a CFD model? The thing about 1D is when I do a tunnel model and I simulate a fire, I have about seven seconds simulation time for a scenario. So there are quite a lot of scenarios I can look at and find the critical ones and understand how the system works. If it's a steep gradient tunnel, the behavior will show me a pattern. And if I interpret this pattern right, I can develop the optimized ventilation solution. A single CFD simulation, 3D, will not help me to see a pattern. That's really, that's powerful. Our experience is opposite. We would do CFD for this project. Mainly, well, we're usually having jet fans and stuff like that, and you would like to see if the placement of jet fans is correct, that they interfere with each other. But frankly, the reality is the main goal is to present the authorities with proof of compliance, that the conditions are maintained for like seven minutes and they're good. And from this perspective, the CFD is necessary as a proof. We as engineers, we benefit from it partially by investigating some of the aspects. But as you said, it's not realistic. I mean, it is possible. It's just not realistic or economically viable to run into these complex simulations with multiple variables included in them. And in that case, this 1D modeling or network modeling seems like an interesting approach. We also deal with some very complex tunnel systems that have junctions, connections, multiple levels, not necessarily in road tunnels. In road tunnels, the world is a little simpler, but in railway tunnels, when you have a railway network with stations and stations have multiple levels, we felt that CFD was the only way we could truly track where the air will go once it enters the station, if it has seven possible outlets. I mean, a railway station, an underground railway station is a classic example where you need CFD. That's not one-dimensional. That's highly three-dimensional. Exactly. So you would also have these experiences switching from tool to tool in this manner. Well, I've done very little CFD in my past work. Usually, we have specialists for that. I don't do it myself. But I can define the boundary conditions. I can discuss the results. I can understand the flow. But the mechanics of the software, I leave that to others. I actually highly respect that because I think this approach should be more widespread in the world and we would have much less issues with systems as we do today. I wanted to ask for another interesting feedback loop that it's obvious but it's in a way missing. The impact of the airflow velocity and the growth of a fire or in general our design fire assumptions for tunnels. We've as a humanity we've been lucky enough to have some full-scale controlled tunnel fire experiments like the memorial tunnel that has been mentioned the eureka upton there was runehammer fire tests that or that was the part of eureka i i always confuse them i think that was so there was the metro project in sw, probably many more fire experiments in the tunnels. There's a tunnel testing facility in Spain, in Aprus, I think it's called, the laboratory. So we have these data points, and they show you the causes of flash vehicle fires, and we just go and employ them in our design. But now when you think about fires in tunnels, there are factors that will for sure change the way how the fire goes. First being the velocity of the air. So you may have something near the critical velocity where you just push the smoke, but not necessarily grow the fire. But if you blow 10 meters per second on the fire, I mean, you don't have to be a fire engineer to understand that increases the severity of the fire. And the same with cross-section of the tunnel. The Runehammer was like 47 square meters in cross-section. That was a tiny tunnel and a huge fire in it, so the radiation from the walls is completely different than you would have in a tunnel that was drilled with 12 meter diameter tbm machine so i wonder to what extent it makes sense to use this design fires as the ultimate basis for our design and other in other way i don't think we have another choice so i didn't look too much into that because the fire dynamics that's that's not really my field of expertise an interesting an interesting aspect was brought up in the paper in graz in 2020 the the geometry of the fire is it usually we assume it's a point mathematical point in the tunnel but if it's a rail wagon on fire or a rail train which really if you have the large fires, it can't be a point. It must have some longitudinal extension. And the physics change if your fire is 5 meters long or if it's 50 meters long. And the critical velocity will change. The smoke spreading will change. The oxygen supply towards the fire will change. I don't think this has been investigated in any depth at all. The fire is also a pump. It pumps air. You take cold air, you heat it up, you pump it upward and it goes away. So it needs a lot of air for a 100 megawatt fire. And if you do a CFD, you can see local velocities of like 5-10 meters per second near the the fire just because the fire exists and it's so powerful in there and I don't think we take this into account you know that such things will happen around the fire we've also investigated a lot about the throttling effect of fires and how this influences the ventilation system in the tunnel. Well that's that was an interesting project. There was a lot of discussion about the fire throttling effect. Yeah. Since, well, I learned about it in 2006 from a paper, from a conference paper. And in 2017, 18, 19, I had a research project funded by the Swiss Road Administration to do a CFD analysis on this. And I had some very interesting findings which contradicted a lot of the papers that were published before. The report was well received. But still, to me, this is a CFD study and I did the CFD myself. So I'd like to mistrust my own results. And I would really love any confirmation or any opposition against those results provided by others, or if possible, even large-scale fire tests to validate the results. Because without large-scale fire tests, the value of these results is a bit limited. the value of these results is a bit limited. The current status is that a PhD student has confirmed the fire throttling effect as found in my study in an independent analysis using different software. But still, that's a verification, that's not a validation. And currently, I'm hoping for funds for a research project where we can actually measure the throttling effect in this Spanish test facility. But that's rather expensive doing full-size fire tests. Yes, I know. So this effect, how does it work? Like the fire is a resistance to the flow and you try to measure how big the resistance is? There are several effects going on. One effect is that the expansion of the heated air in the fire, which causes a local pressure drop because of the acceleration, that's Panuli more or less, or momentum balance. And then you have increased friction downstream because of the higher volume you push through the tunnel. And there's another effect downstream from the fire when you have temperature stratification. And the flow profile resembles the temperature profile. So it's not the fully developed tube flow you know from the cold airflow. And the resistance along the tunnel of this oddly shaped flow profile is apparently higher than the normal tunnel flow. And this is significant. This fire throttling effect, if this temperature stratification remains stable, that would be relevant for ventilation design. I've read your report and I loved it. And it immediately struck me that, again, in the outdoors world, like when we commission a tunnel, when we do hot smoke testing in it with two, three, five megawatt source in it, we base it could impact the ventilation system in a negative way. Like it's a higher resistance that you would have to push against. For us, it was interesting opposite way, like the wind effects on the tunnel fire. If the wind is acting on the tunnel, let's say against us, and there is this increased resistance that comes from large fire being there, mainly the thermal expansion and this heat pump that I talked just briefly before, then maybe the wind effect would have less severity because it would also act against this local throttle, making the whole equation so complex, probably unsolvable, because suddenly you have so many forces that act on each other and influence each other. But the main point is, we base our opinion on thing that is happening in this brief moment when we do the hot smoke test, unfortunately not possible with 100 megawatts or not really welcomed by the owners of the tunnel to do that with 100 megawatts. And in a way, you know, understanding that in reality, it's going to be different because there's going to be different forces acting than we have now. These smoke tests, they convey a level of safety that's not really there. It's very good for public opinion. You can have a nice movie, you get the smoke stratification. It's also an effect. I don't think there were too many real fires where we had a stable smoke layer. Because usually vehicles are moving in the smoke. There's a fire brigade is rushing in and every movement like that will disturb the smoke layer. It might not disturb the temperature stratification, but the visibility. And all these fire tests show very stable smoke stratification. So it's, again, the test and what you see there is, it conveys a level of safety that might not be there. My experience is that the bigger the fire, the better the stratification, though. That's fruit number, yeah. The stronger the temperature stratification, the better the stability of the smoke layer as well, yes. But in reality, I also think that in a hot smoke test, when you immediately set on fire 5 megawatt pans of diesel and gasoline, like people do that Austrian style. I love that. It's also an unrealistic representation of the growth of the fire, which will be growing, which will be hopefully slower in a way, and may not have this buoyancy or will be spread at a larger fire source, not necessarily a point source, like a pan would be a point source. And there's also the traffic behavior. There were so many, especially in tunnels that got an emergency breakdown lane. We don't have that in Switzerland. Most tunnels don't have that. But if you have that, the likelihood that a fire occurs on that breakdown lane is probably the highest in the tunnel cross-section, which leaves two lanes of traffic free for the vehicles. So maybe the vehicles will not stop in front of the fire, as we assume in our safety analysis. They will continue to go through. They will see close to nothing, but still they will continue to push through. That's how people act. And a tough one for the end. We've discussed so many interesting aspects of the tunnel fire safety and ventilation and how much research you see about these particular aspects because, and I mean in peer-read papers, because I see very little. The only places where I really see this research as a great source of knowledge is,'ve mentioned Grad's conference, and that's a place where you can learn a lot. There's PR conferences, but in peer-reviewed research, I have this odd feeling it's all about critical velocities and back-layering scale models of tunnels. I'm really let down by the fact how disconnected or disjoint from the engineering that is. Yes, I mean, the engineers don't read period papers. They are too expensive and usually you don't come across them. Most engineers are not directly connected to a university, so they simply don't have access to these papers. The only thing they have access to is conferences where the community meets. And the same, the research for these projects is done by engineering companies and not at universities. So there's research done in Germany. It's funded by BAST. In Switzerland, it's funded by Astra. In Austria, they've got their research program. It's done by engineering companies. And in the past couple of years, there has been some work done on human behavior with the sprinkler systems and what do people actually do. And we've got, due to the European directive, we've got by now considerable data from real events. This was another change in the last 20 years. Now we really know, we get the reports, we see what happened, how people behaved. We also get measurements, and that's something else. We've got more equipment in the tunnel that gives us more data, yes. I would put the case in a reverse order. The scientists are also not engineers, and they rarely have practical experience designing or solving technical issues in tunnels. And there's a level of problems that you only learn when you face them and when you match them on a real project, and that are not evident in a small-scale tunnel in your laboratory. And you can run into this loophole of critical velocity or back layering distance, which is very interesting to research. I would say it's fairly easy to research in your scale models because they're very convenient for that. You've already said you don't use critical velocity and I do not either. I do not really care that much about that concept. Well, I think the critical velocity is a design requirement. It defines the capacity of the system. And I like the Swiss approach to this. The Swiss design code for road tunnel ventilation just says we want three meters per second. They don't talk about critical velocity at all. We want three meters per second. And I think that's a very sound approach. And so much easier than a page-long equation to solve for the fourth significant digit in the value of that. And with every new edition of NFPA, it changes. Yes, we've seen the papers that actually, and I'm happy with that, they started questioning the new values that there are. They started to be unreasonably high, like unrealistically high and without really sound proof of why we need as high numbers because they translate into cost, operational cost, construction cost and they just make it more difficult to design the system, which probably has worked even with the previous versions. And this may be another problem where we don't research these things enough. We've got these design codes in Europe which are pretty well fixed and there are too many engineering companies where people think we already know everything. So they don't do research anymore. If you go to the conferences and you see the work that's presented there it's so much today there's so much more about projects we did and no longer questions asked and it goes more into marketing and less into research which is a pity because i think there's still a lot of work to do thank you thank you for that i'm happy to finally have an engineer in the podcast and well you're a scientist to me and it was a great pleasure to discuss with you the challenges of resiliency of safety in tunnels and then eventually ventilation i i think a beneficial thing would be to advertise a bit these conferences or the places where the engineering mixes with research and for me such a place is this tunnel safety ventilation conference in Graz and I hope to be there this this year it's it's in May May 9th to 10th in Graz in Austria and I'll link to that conference in the bottom you have your favorite conference outside of Graz? Well, actually, in the past couple of years, I only went to Graz. There is the EHR conferences, British Hydraulic Research Institute, which I left 20 years ago, but I didn't have the opportunity to go there. They were very innovative and very technical, the ones on tunnel fire and ventilation, but I don't know how they developed the past 10 to 15 years. There's also a PIAG conference in Granada that's happening in October, I think. I hope to be there as well. The PIAG conferences, they are more strategic and state-of-the-art. They are less scientific. There are different topics discussed. And I would also like to highlight that the materials from the technical conferences in Graz are available online usually, and you can find them. I just see your paper on throttling effects. It's there. That's great that this is being shared outside of the conference to be used. So I'll link to these resources, and I'll also link to your research that you have been doing. Inga, thank you very much for coming here and being a part of the podcast. It was a huge pleasure to have you in here. And see you soon on some tunneling project in Europe. Thank you for having me. I hope to meet you in Graz. Yeah, looking forward to that. See you soon. And that's it. What a great talk with Ingoo i'm really happy to have discussed with him especially the risk aspect you know this whole concept of resiliency and how you could actually build a third tunnel nodes just to have the tunnel operational for for the time of refurbishment that's this is something very new for me and very intriguing. And it makes a lot of sense when you think about the economical impact that tunnels have. And when Ginga told you that he doesn't like to do CFD, doesn't feel secure about it, please don't trust him. dimensional codes for tunnel ventilation and everything. So I am way more confident in his capabilities than he is. And I've read his report on throttling effects, which is linked in the show notes, and it is purely excellent. One of the best pieces I've read in a long time. So for the end, I think the resources are there. You should follow Ingo on ResearchGate where he posts all his reports. That's actually the best place to go, I assume. We also advertise hard the GRATS conference because it is really good. It's a really great conference for everyone dealing with tunnels. It's full of great people, full of great research. It's a great place to be if you're engineering tunnels. I hope to be there and I hope to see you there. That's it for the episode. Thank you very much and cross fingers for Ukraine and the safety of Ukrainian people, please. And let's stop the madmen from blowing up the world. Thank you and see and see you soon.
