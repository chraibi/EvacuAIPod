 Hello everybody, thanks for tuning in to the Firesense show. I've lured you here with the promise that every Wednesday there's going to be a new episode, but unfortunately this is not the case today. Due to an overwhelming weeks in the laboratory, I've spent most of my time in Pyeongchang, Udonwosu, which meant I had to move on some really interesting interviews that were planned. I thought I'm gonna get away with that, but I got some throat infection. It's really annoying. I cannot really speak for longer than a few minutes, and I really hope to heal it up before there's a one-year anniversary episode to be recorded. I hope you will forgive me this lack of Wednesday entertainment for you. I know many of you have joined the podcast in the last month, so there's plenty of really good jam episodes waiting there for you, waiting to catch up. I actually would like to give you three recommendations for listening this week if these episodes were somehow missed by you. My first recommendation, based on the recent events, there were big bus fires happening in Europe, in Paris a few weeks ago, in London a few weeks ago. Really interesting to see these buses burn, but not very surprising. And actually, there was a podcast episode with Anja Bullinghaus-Hoffmann about the bus industry and how diverse it is from, let's say, train industry or aircraft industry, how setting certain regulations has led to parallel industries which seem so similar, yet the differences in flammability are vast. And that episode is all about it, episode 29. The second recommendation I have for you, there was a lot of great feedback after the episode with Anne Templeton, the last one, and a lot of you seem to enjoy evacuation episodes, human behavior episodes, and I thought that if you missed it, there's episode 16 with Enrico Ronchi and Ruggero Albreglio, where we go through the future of evacuation modeling. It gives you a really good background. Why do we need social sciences in evacuation studies? How can evacuation modeling improve in the future? And what is the direction this field is going to? That's a really great episode. And if you missed that, episode 16 is all there for you. And third, recommendations for all you diehard fans of fire science and if by any chance you've missed the episode with sarah mccallister you got to catch up with that journey through the scales of fire phenomena i would say that's within my three most favorite episodes of the show and the one that i've listened to multiple times. Actually, I really enjoyed that episode because I really enjoy fire science, and I hope you do as well. And for you diehard fans who've listened to every single episode, well, you guys will understand. Sorry for messing up this week. As all of my podcast mentors have said, keep a healthy backlog of episodes ready to be aired every week. It's not easy, but now I really see why it is necessary, and I promise I'll work on a healthy amount of episodes. So in case of throat failures like this one, you'll still have some fun stuff waiting for you. Anyway, I feel the pain kicking in, and I really need to heal this up. So please excuse me this week. I hope you enjoy the rest of the fire science show content. And I hope you will join me in celebrating one year anniversary of the podcast. The next week, we're going to talk about lessons learned through the podcast and the mission of the show. How's it going? Am I reaching my goals? I'm going to have some questions to you and I hope together we'll make this show even better. So, yeah, thanks for tuning in and have a great Wednesday. Cheers. Bye.
