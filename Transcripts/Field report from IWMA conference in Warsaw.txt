 Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to Firesize Show session 26. Today I have a very different episode. I've been playing a journalist and I've went into a conference and I'm about to give you a relation of about what happened on the conference, what I like and have some interviews with the participants. So a few months ago I've learned that there's going to be an International Water Misassociation Conference in Warsaw, where I live. So that has made me very happy, not too far away to go for a conference. In the meantime, I've contacted Bettina McDowell, who is the secretary for the IWMA, and I've kindly asked her if it would be interesting for me to come to the conference, sneak around, talk with some people and then maybe produce a podcast episode about it. And she was very happy to provide me the chance to be there. So I gladly took it and I'm very happy I did. One thing for sure, having a conference in your hometown is not the easiest thing to do and I've missed most of the social events. But nevertheless, I've participated in of the social events but nevertheless I've participated in the most important parts which were the sessions and these sessions were really really interesting. The conference was held for two days in a very beautifully located hotel near the Wozienki Park in Warsaw. I highly recommend this area if you ever come to Warsaw. The conference was separated into six sessions with a panel discussion and then a member meeting of the association. So I hope the members of the association were very happy with it. There was over 100 people on the site and some attendees that joined us remotely because it was also a hybrid event so i would say for the times we're at it was very well organized very nice and i'm really happy to have been to a real conference i don't remember when was my previous time so now for the topic obviously a water mist association they do conferences about water mist. And water mist is a technology for suppression. It's similar to how sprinklers work. So you have remote devices in your building that when activated, they spray water inside the building. Either each of them separately or you can activate them all together like in the deluge system the difference is within the nozzles and the pressures water mist would work at much higher pressures than sprinklers and the consequence of that is that water spray is consisting of much smaller droplets so these droplets are not as effective in penetrating the fire as the water from sprinklers would be but they are very easy to evaporate so they are very efficient at taking the heat away from the smoke and flames and that's one of the ideas of operation of the water mist systems and I've learned a lot about water mist systems on the conference actually I remember 8 or 9 years ago I had to prepare a white paper for my company about water mist systems on the conference actually i remember eight or nine years ago i had to prepare a white paper for my company about water mist technology and i really enjoyed it back then and now to see how this technology has matured and grown it's really unbelievable one thing that i've learned here is that water mist guys are really into full-scale fire testing and verifying the performance of their solutions in like true tests where they literally put up fires of relevant commodities and try to extinguish them with water mist to prove that the technology is actually correct for this type of an application. And this is fantastic. I don't think I've ever seen a field of fire science so well-fueled with a fire dynamics and building-like tests. It's so different from the world of smoke control and so different from the world of fire testing than I'm used to. So it was very, very refreshing to participate and see all these new applications for water mist that were presented on the site. Now let's move into the conference. And first, I've talked with the chairman of the IWMA, Mr. Are Vandelborg Brand. And yeah, we've discussed about the conference, the history and the future of the water mist. Hello, I'm here with Are Vandelborg Brand, who's the chairman of International Water Mist Association and also a researcher in RISE, Research Institute of Sweden. Hi, Arek. Great to have you in Poland. Yeah. Thank you for bringing this conference to Poland. That's much appreciated. Yeah, thank you. It's nice being here. I haven't been to Warsaw before, so that's a great opportunity. I'm happy to to hear that so you brought 100 participants uh here in covet times that's an achievement very pleased with that very pleased with that yeah that makes me very happy it's also i'm impressed this is like 20th conference is that true yeah that's that's quite a history is Does that mean it's 20 years of WaterMist or more? It's more. We're supposed to be the 21st due to the COVID situation. We had to postpone last year's conference and move it to this year. And the organization has existed a few years before we started with the conferences as well. Well, if it was 20, it would be much nicer. But having more is not the problem. So we're entering like third decade of WaterMist. So what are your feelings about the future of the technology? Because I certainly see it a lot more than 10 years ago. There's a lot more projects, a lot more interest in the community about application of water mists. So how does the future look for you? Well, it's been a slow process. As you say, we've been working with this for almost 30 years and working on the standard for 20 years. The new European standard, 4972. And that has arrived now and been approved finally. And I think that will bring a huge boost to the industry and to the promotion of water mist. And when you have a standard that you can test against, which is the European standard for land-based, that will bring a lot more attention and acceptance of water mist, I believe. As I understand the approach, it's in a way similar to how sprinklers are put into the market. You demonstrate the capability of a solution to fight a certain type of a fire. And to my audience, it may be actually interesting because I think these water-based fixed extinguishing systems are one of the very few where such an approach would be common. For example, in smoke control, we would rely on simulations and other means of calculation of the performance. You resort to full-scale testing. What are your thoughts about this approach? Do you think it's truly viable? I think that in the future you can do more simulations and calculations, but at the end you need to get the final approval with testing. Fire in general is difficult to simulate because it's not linear. And when you add water and evaporation and droplet movements and all that sort of things into the equation as well. From my point of view, the simulation is a pointer. It's not the final answer. You only get the final answer by doing the final test. Yeah. And I think there's a lot of fire science in these tests as well, because as long as in simulation you can fiddle with the parameters, you can even change the gravity if you want. In full-scale testing, there are some things that you cannot jump above, and it definitely gives you a large base of research results that you can work with, and that's interesting. I'm wondering to what extent results of these protocols, that's how you call the experiments in this field I've learned, are these results obtainable by scientists or you have to be in FM Global or RISE to have them? When we do tests for a producer to document their nozzles or their system. The results are their property. Okay. So I'm, as a scientist, it's not allowed to do it away. But you can approach producers asking to get the results. And with the permission from the producer, we are using the results as input for the simulations and calculations. So there is work going on. And I think we need both. I'm asking because in FASAS, for example, we had the exact same issue. A lot of tests done, all hidden behind and on disclosure agreements and stuff like that. But in my institute, together with Imperial College London, we've managed to find a way how to anonymize them and work on them as a big data project, which opened a lot of doors that were previously closed in terms of data analysis. And it was something interesting. And then I see your people doing this dozens of full-scale burns. And it's so fascinating to me that such a field exists. And it's so common. It's like almost natural for you to burn a whole warehouse just to see that the nozzle works. In an ideal world, we should share all the data, but the properties of the producer and it's their company secrets. And they're trained to sell their products. So I understand them as well. But ideally, as a scientist, I would have liked to be able to share all the data with everyone and i have one more question regarding the water miss technology how do you would place it within the the systems market and in terms of for example in poland we're in poland so i'll refer to polish context our law does not dictate whether it's mist or sprinklers or foam. It just says fixed water extinguishing systems. Do you perceive it also in a way as equivalent or maybe you feel like it's a tool for particular areas, niches? I think all extinguishing systems has their strengths and weaknesses. Water mist has it, sprinkler has it, gaseous system has it, foam has it, everyone. So I think that water mist is just one tool that the builders can choose from, and they need knowledge to evaluate which type of system is best for their application. And I think that water mist could be used in a lot more applications than they are used today, but not all. I'm surprised looking on the conference program, there's industrial oil fires, there are archives. I've seen some tunnel tests with extremely huge fires with WaterMist. So I see that this industry is really working on finding the technologies and solutions for all the needs. Historically, water mist has been used in special cases. Yes. So protecting aircraft hangars and, as you said, tunnels, historical buildings. And ships, yeah, I think. The ships was the first. That was the early 90s when after the Scandinavian Star accident or fire, then the bottom is really got momentum going in the IMO organization. So in maritime, it's widely used and widely accepted as a way of extinguishing fires. But it's been a real struggle to get the same acceptance onshore as you have on maritime. And this is quite surprising because maritime requirements are usually like 10 times more severe than building requirements. So you would imagine that if something is well accepted in maritime, it's not that easy. As we found out. But it's great to see the great amount of research being put into this technology. It's great to see full-scale fire tests being done in multiple numbers in many places of the world. It's also amazing how many new fire laboratories are born to carry for the need of sprinkler producers and water mist producers to perform these tests and these protocols of real fires. So I wish all the best to the Watomis technology. Thank you. I'm sure it will grow and prosper in the future. Yes. Thank you very much for inviting me to the conference and all the best, Are. So as Are mentioned, the future looks bright for the WaterMist technology. I wonder if really one day we could lay our hands on this data from file testing of different laboratories that test these protocols of WaterMist and other suppression systems. That could be actually quite interesting. And I hope I've planted some inception in Are's head to try and at least work a bit on the RISE data, which is very rich to what I know. ARA has mentioned an important thing that happened just recently, which was the publication of the European Water Misstandard EN 14972. And from what I have noticed in the conference, there is a lot of interest about the standard. There are presentations related to it. There's a discussion panel completely devoted to the standard. So I assume this is a very important event for the community. And we'll come back to that just in a few seconds. But first, I wanted to share with you another discussion I had. First, I wanted to share with you another discussion I had. It was with our local colleague, Dr. Piotr Tofewo, who is the president of Polish Suppression System Foundation, an organization that's promoting suppression systems in Poland. And Piotr is interested in growing this field of fire technology in Poland. this field of fire technology in Poland. And it's quite a challenging move to do that in Poland because Poland is not really a sprinkler country. And that's just one of the things I wanted to talk with Piotr about. What is the sprinkler culture and why in some parts of the world it's quite obvious you put sprinklers inside your building. And in other places such as Poland, it's not that often that you find them. So yeah let's jump into the talk with Piotr. I'm here with Piotr Tofi≈Ço, the head of Polish Suppression System Foundation. Hi Piotr. Hello, hello Wojtek. And one of the organizers of this conference. First congratulations on organizing this event. I see it's very successful for the troubling times we're in. Yes, yes. I think it's successful because this topic, the use of water mist suppression agent in Poland is actually on the rise. A lot of people are really interested on many, many details regarding this relatively new technology, at least in Poland. So we are not the organizers. The organizers are International Water Mist Association. We're just local helpers. But it's actually a great thing. And I think this organization actually appreciates that there is such a big interest in this technology in Poland. It's the second actually conference. The previous one was in Krakow, like two or three years ago. And we also hosted this suppression detection conference two years ago, which was also quite fun, I remember. Yes, we actually invited Bettina McDowell, who is the secretary of IWMA. So she was present, so we collaborated. That's great. Thanks for bringing the world's best specialists to us. And I'm really happy that Poland is also viewed as an emerging market for the big players in the suppression systems industry. So you had a keynote that opened this conference and I found it interesting because Poland is not necessarily a country of sprinkler culture and you exactly know what I mean and I think many of my listeners who live in countries similar to Poland know what I mean that sprinklers are for some reason not very popular or water-based extinguishing systems are for some reason considered as difficult expensive hassle and yet we as engineers as scientists we recognize their performance we recognize what they bring to the fire environment and tell me does such a thing as a sprinkler culture exist and if it does exist why poland it does not seem like a sprinkler country and is that something that's going to change poland is actually similar to the rest of europe a little bit because historically there was a bigger influence of passive fire protection in Europe, and still it is, and nowadays also active fire protection in terms of smoke control and ventilation is actually also much appreciated in Europe. On the other hand, in the United States and other parts of the world, the sprinklers are more frequently... Like common. Yeah, they are common. There's a big technology, there is a big history, there is a lot of solutions and applications. It's a very, very mature technology, actually. And it is mature also in respect that the whole related community, like Fire Brigade, and everyone knows the important bits of this technology. So it kind of works flawlessly in the societies. But, well, in Poland, on the other hand, we do have a significant number of local companies who are really competent. And so historically, we didn't have a lot of sprinklers in Poland. As far as I know, the first sprinklers in Poland were installed in connection with some cable factory near Warsaw. And it was installed because it was a French company, so they wanted really to be well protected, and it was like in the 70s. So since then, the technology is on the rise. We are comparable to some other countries. I mean, we still have maybe half of the sprinklers that the UK has every year installed, but we are catching up quite a lot. So definitely there is a need to actually popularize this topic. It's important to share reliable knowledge. This is what we are trying to do. I think an interesting outcome of this, let's say, low popularity or late introduction of the technology to the country is that I assume that in the US you would fit sprinklers because that's a common thing to do. You would not question the need of a sprinkler system. You would just design it because that's how the buildings are designed. Yet in Poland, we would focus on the performance of the device. You would have to prove that it is really needed. It can change the outcomes of a fire or you just want to attack the allowances from the building code that allow you to build larger building or have a longer evacuation pathways but it's in a way related to to performance so well yes sprinklers in Poland are typically used because of the regulations. If you cannot do something, you often have to apply sprinklers. But on the other hand, this is the topic you asked initially is whether we have a culture. This is actually what we studied at my university, the main school of fire service. We looked at reliability and we studied data from the fire brigade, and it wasn't easy task. This data is not perfect in Poland, but we put extra effort to actually analyze the description of every fire that was involved, sprinklers. So we ended up having an estimate of the reliability of 96%. So it actually is comparable with the international data. So it shows that in Poland this technology doesn't work differently so far. So definitely we will have to educate all stakeholders about this technology to improve. I know that this transfer of knowledge, this education and promoting the technology was one of the reasons you've started the Superstition System Foundation in Poland. So how's it going for the Polish Superstition System Foundation? I see the conference, so that's a good step, but what are your next steps? Yes, so this is popularizing and bringing people together. So this part is relatively easy. Okay what's what's difficult is actually to challenge and change those kind of long-standing beliefs how to actually the the whole structure of fire regulations how actually everything connects and where's the logic And sometimes we have logic which dates back for 50 years. And so nobody remembers why and nobody remembers logic and justification. The beauty of magic numbers. So this is what we have to actually face. And it is so hard to stand up and say, look, everything is wrong. We have to start from scratch. stand up and say, look, everything is wrong. We have to start from scratch. But to do that, we have to really collect a lot of important data and evidence to actually suggest that the change is needed. It's a hard job, actually. Yeah, I think this education in countries like in here and to any of you listeners who are in a similar sprinkler culture countries, this is a viable technology well tested for more than 100 years and definitely useful for many reasons so i think this pushing on the education is probably the best way to have a healthy culture in your own country because it's easy to write it in the standard that you have to have one piece of water-based extinguishing system in it but you know that doesn't solve the problem of doing this system correctly in a way that truly delivers safety in the buildings yes in general fire protection of buildings is a complex topic and there is a lot of confusion we see a lot of confusion in poland, like I mentioned, sometimes some rules are very old, nobody is questioning them and it's very hard to question them. But that's why we have to really make a good effort to actually show everyone how it can look like, how we can protect buildings better and how to use the present day technologies to achieve that. Thanks. Thanks, Piotr. And enjoy the rest of the conference. And it was great to catch up with you. See you around. Thank you very much, Wojtek. So thanks, Piotr, for this cultural introduction into the world of sprinkler culture and how it is in Poland. This was also a part of his opening keynote of the conference. In the sessions, in the first two sessions, there was plenty of interesting talks. The first was by Hans Schipper about protection of industrial oil fryers, which are seemingly quite a challenge to extinguish, and the water mist that was used has proven to be quite effective in controlling these fires. Then we've learned about upgrading the performance of first attack systems and the way of developing spray technology. It was presented by Giancarlo Franchini from Italy. After the break, we had some talks about water mist technologies in testing. Our colleague Bogdan Lacega has presented New Polish Laboratory, and Christopher Gill from Viking has discussed in depth some anti-corrosion tackling systems, which I assume is very important for maintaining the reliability of these systems. And yeah, reliability is the keyword because the talk that really caught my attention and it was really inspiring and interesting was a talk given by Arstein Fidoy from Ingus AS in Norway, who was talking about sprinkler reliability and how this knowledge could be used for other water-based extinguishing systems. And that was a hell of a talk. It was really interesting and he has brought so many important points that reliability studies often do not distinguish much between the types of the sprinklers, while it will very matter for the outcomes, that the definition of what means a successful release of water is not necessarily defined, and it would vary between the studies. It doesn't mean that the fire was extinguished, it was confined to the location where it started. It doesn't mean it was confined to the room of its origin and all of the probabilities for the both will be completely different so in the end if we are working with reliability statistics but we don't really know what this number truly means what is the final fire outcome within this reliability, it gives a huge dose of uncertainty in designing fire safety systems. And we must realize that often water-based extinguishing systems are used in buildings as proxies of safety. Like if you sprinkle the building, it's going to be safe. And many of the technical systems in the building are designed with this principle in mind, that there are sprinklers that will operate in the building is going to be safe. And many of the technical systems in the building are designed with this principle in mind, that there are sprinklers that will operate in the building. And if the sprinklers are not working, they're in a way unreliable at that moment, it completely changes the outcomes of the fires. And so in a way, these reliability statistics are absolutely key to designing the fire safety of the buildings at all. And there are some doubts about how the existing statistics were produced, how the surveys were performed, how the results were analyzed. And Arsene actually has published a book about this sprinkler reliability, which I'm going to link in the show notes. And I just couldn't stop it, and I had to invite him for a few questions. So here you go. You're going to hear about it directly from Arsene Fide. So hi, Arsene. Thanks for spending a few seconds with me. I really enjoyed your talk on the reliability of sprinklers and water mist, I assume, as well. In your research, you've looked into statistics of reliability, but you took quite an interesting approach to try and understand how the statistics are built rather than find a blind value of what their reliability is so maybe you can introduce the listeners to your work on reliability. Thank you for that yes the work to try to understand all the statistics and service that's been done on reliability has to come from somewhere. They have to have some kind of idea why they wanted to find this out and how they wanted to do the survey. The problem for me as a scientist to find out what was actually done to come to the conclusions that are very strongly proposed that are accurate. Because when you look at all the service that's been done, they have a big difference in level of reliability. Some of them suggest as low as 80%, and others point out that the reliability is close to 100%, just a few decimals. And there has to be some reason for that. So my approach to it was, okay, first of all, I wanted to find out if I just could read the surveys that were done and find out from there. But that gave me much more questions. Okay. But that gave me much more questions. Okay. So the next question I had to ask myself was, are there any type of analysis I can do on the survey itself to find out what's been done? And that was actually very fortunate to find out that this approach was applied scientific methods within all the areas of scientific, like in social areas. I started to think, okay, if they are using these kind of methods to find out if this is true, this survey, can I apply it for the engineering field as well? And to my surprise, and fortunately, you could. The principle applies. So, yeah, that was a very interesting approach because it was very systematically it's actually quite important because for me the consumer of the numbers i don't research sprinkler reliability but i heavily rely on that i see and i usually see numbers between 85 percent 95 percent and it is kind of important to me because if I see number 95%, that's not bad. That's quite a reliable system. However, 85%, that means one in the six times it's not going to work well. That's quite a drastic difference. And then especially when you come into the world of, let's say, sustainable timber buildings, into the world of, let's say, sustainable timber buildings, the moment that once your structure starts burning and participating in a fire and you have very limited means to stop it, and your whole strategy relies on this single system to be reliable, this reliability data becomes more than critical for the project. That's like the whole project is on it. reliability data becomes more than critical for the project. That's like the whole project is on it. So if it's 95% or 85%, that makes quite a severe difference, right? Yeah, very big. Actually, talking about what I like to talk about is Titanic syndrome. We talk about Titanic syndrome is the assumption because I've done this and this and this. This is ship within practical sense, not sink. But as long as it's out on the water, there is always the possibility that something can go wrong. Yeah. The special thing about Titanic was that it happened on its first trip. Yes. Yeah. So many people know about that and they also know about it that they were very aggressive advertising in the hand that take the ship you're perfectly safe and that's a little bit the same where within the fire community. We talk about that we have actually very good control on fires. But the problem is that the fires that we have seen all the time, but especially the last 20 years, I think, has shown us that there's still happening a lot of things that we have no clue to why does this happen. As an engineer, as a scientific person, we have to ask ourselves, is my approach within my field, within fire, the correct one? Or could I do better? And I think that one of the reasons we don't do that is because it hurts to find out, okay, perhaps we do not know so much about, for instance, what I'm talking about today, sprinkler reliability, because we have been trying to put that number down for almost 130 years. And suddenly the guy from Norway tells you that, sorry, but the methods you've done is absolutely not correct. Unscientific. Yeah, not scientific at all. And then the question goes on from a strictly scientific point to be a personal. And you'll be offended. Yeah. You want you do not want to learn anything about it. And that's what makes this the whole area of fire expertise very difficult, because we have a lot of feelings for work. We know we're working with something that's very important. So we have the personal touch as well that have a much bigger impact on what we do and how we do things than we probably like to think. Yeah, that was really good. And I really enjoyed your talk. I will link your book on reliability of sprinkler systems in the show notes. I guess they're kicking us out. But I would absolutely love to continue that as a separate episode. And I hope we can manage and record it so it goes out soon. Thank you so much, Arnstein. And congratulations. It was a really, really nice talk. I've enjoyed it a lot. Thank you. Same to you. Wow, the talk with Arnstein has really blew my mind and I immediately see so much impact in this reliability statistics and how they influence the safety of buildings, it is incredible to what extent such a number has an impact over a built environment and as I mentioned in the interview, I'm definitely taking this into a full episode and I've already invited Einstein to come to the show and let's talk about reliability of sprinklers and I'm also organizing a separate episode about how reliability statistics influence the design of buildings, which I think also will be interesting to you all. Obviously, the session continued and there were many, many more good talks, including a talk about Hong Zhangui from FM Global about extinguishing exhaust duct fires. There was a talk by Yun Ku from National Research Council Canada on protecting mass timber buildings, and that was really interesting, and I really enjoyed it a lot. Water mist and mass timber are like two technologies that fit each other together so well because of the capabilities of mist to control fires and the limited damage that the water does to the timber. Because in water mist technology, you use much less water than you would in sprinkler technology, I assume. Yeah, that was definitely something to look up for, and I have a feeling that we are going to hear a lot of great things coming on the use of water mist in mass timber buildings in the future. The day has ended with a large session dedicated to the new standard EN 14972. There was a presentation by Alex Peler from VID Firekill in Denmark about the status of the standard, and that was followed with a large discussion panel about the road ahead for WaterMist and the new developments related to this master standard that has just been published. I saw that it was a big deal to everyone around the publication of this standard and so much attention was given to this topic. The next day I've decided to take Alex Palais on the site and I've asked him a few questions about the new standard developments and what the future holds for the WaterMist technology. So yeah, that's what he told me. I'm here with Alex Pellet from EID Firekill Denmark. What a nice name. You're killing fires. Yeah, yeah, that's what we do. That's what you do, killing fires with water. Good. Alex was giving an update on the state of EN 14972 standard. And as I observed you guys in this conference, everyone is at least excited about the standard or at least there's this atmosphere of something important happening for the community. So tell me, why is this standard such a big deal for your community? I think you also have to recognize that we spent 22 years on developing. So when you invest so much time, it is really amazing that we now have an end product. And also for the industry itself, it means that we are suddenly not seen as a special technology, but it can become what it has to become, what it is supposed to become, which is a commodity technology. Like you have sprinklers, you have foam, you have gas, and you have water mist. And now you can say also in the normal world or in the standardization world, now it's also equal. It's the same. And that's why it's important. So when you see the passion here, this conference, people being happy that it's finally there, it's two things. One, we spent so much time on it, and two, now it's here, right? So it's excitement plus a huge dose of relief. Correct. And as I said also in my presentation that in my case, so I come from a family of all been working within FIRE. And my father was even in that standardization group when it started. Okay. And he retired. So then I came in. So you can say for me personally, this has also been a family journey. Nice. It's like raising a child. 22 years old. It can drink alcohol in the U.S. now. So good. But it's not the end of the road because it's part one which summarizes the whole concepts. And now there's a bunch of substandards to be written about how to test the water mist for particular applications. And how is that going? It's going well. And I would not say that we're having to write the protocols. They are already existing in the market. So what we're doing is we're taking the, let's call it the best, the highest quality standards, test standards from VDS, from FM, from LPCB. And then we're embedding them in the SIN world, of course. You could say we're adjusting it to the EN world. So currently we have planned those two to 17 parts, so that's 16 parts, which covers basically all that you need to protect a building with water mist. Then, of course, we will then begin after that work, we will embed further test protocols. So there are new protocols being made every day. You've also seen that in the conference. So we will continue that work. So it will be never-ending work. But I expect, let's say, within the next two, three years, I think we have the parts in place. Tell me, because I know you have experience in creating this protocol. How does one create the protocol? You figure out an application and then‚Ä¶ I mean, it depends on‚Ä¶ You also saw some presentations from FM Research in this conference. And as you can see, there's a lot of background testing or pre-testing to let's say to define the appropriate way of writing the test protocol. So you have to take into account what's your objective first of all. Are you looking at extinguishment or are you looking at control and suppression? So with that said you also need to look at the environment in real life. So are we talking small closed rooms? Are we talking big halls with plenty of oxygen available and so on? So when you have these things taken into account, then you have to begin to look at what type of fuels do we want to use in such a protocol. And there are different approaches, but I also believe that now we have so many protocols using more or less the same type of fuels. So it is becoming easier and easier. But it's a long task. It's a lot of work to develop a test protocol. I've heard it's a good part of career to produce plastic cups. That is definitely right. I mean, FM plastic cups you've heard about. It's expensive. These are legendary. These are legendary in our community. And you're my fifth or sixth guest in this conference, and to all of them I say I am amazed by the amount of full-scale research being performed on water. It's something you barely see in other fields of fire safety. Certainly in my field of smoke control and ventilation, that is, we're on the absolute other side of the spectrum with the use of modeling for almost everything, and the full-scale tests are very rare. In your case, the full-scale testing is the common way, and modeling would be something not that common. And we just had a great talk by Max Ackernan about the use of CFD in here, and I wondered, from your experience, to what extent this technology is something that you guys are looking for? Or do you consider it useful, needed? I could say that I don't believe that we'll ever get to a stage where it's possible to simulate fire, including the behavior of fire when you include water mist into the equation, right? What I do believe is that we can use it for once we've done all these tests that we are doing in the industry, then if there are small modifications in real life, so let's say you have adjustments or changes, then you can most likely, you can take the results, you have the data you have, you can make sure that your simulation matches that, and then you can adjust the environment a little bit. So more like exploratory tool, not commissioning tool, not the final proof the solution works. I mean, you know, you're working in this industry also with this, so you know how hard it is to simulate the fire itself. Just imagine taking into account the water mist, which it comes in billions of droplets. So I know we're talking about an average droplet size, but it comes in billions of droplet sizes, it comes in billions of different velocities and so on. So how can you really simulate that? Yes, that's absolutely true, and that's the one challenge that we are facing. And even then, to simulate a single sprinkler or water sprinkler, I guess I could perform such a simulation with my tools, and maybe even I would get an accurate representation. But we were talking just about the sprinkler flow and water distribution and not, let's say, water-induced flows or heat transfer to the droplets, evaporation, influences on the flame chemistry, because Max said that's the most difficult one, and I completely agree with that. And yet, in your full-scale test, that's explicitly modeled because you don't turn the combustion model in your experiment. No, that's right, that's right. I see there's a bright future for this technology, for this community. And I'm very happy that I could join you guys in here and all the best developing your hundreds of protocols. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. As you noticed with Alex, we've talked a lot about CFD systems because our discussion took place just after a great talk by Max Lackanen from IFAB Germany, who discussed the use of CFD to assess the impact of different variations of water mist systems. And for me personally, that was such an interesting talk because I myself am a CFD engineer and I do simulate building fires all the time, especially with relation to smoke control systems, and learn how this technology can be used in water mist was really fascinating. And I really appreciated the way how Max has shown the true capabilities of CFD codes without being trigger-happy or over-optimist. He explained how the water mist is usually modeled by Lagrangian particles, how the particle physics is challenging for the modeling, how the number of particles will have a huge impact on the overall CFD simulations. But the thing I liked the most about his talk was how he subdivided, let's say, the CFD tasks related to water mist into easy, medium, and hot. the CFD tasks related to water mist into easy, medium, and hot. In easy, he claimed that it's easy to change a single parameter in a system or in a building fire to track what happens. It's easy to measure the activation times for sprinklers, and it's quite easy to simulate spray patterns of single devices. Into medium, he mentioned it's quite hard to measure temperatures and smoke in CFD simulations with water mist active, and it's very difficult to quantify the influence that a fire has on humans. And into the hard category, he placed the fire spread and combustion modeling, which I completely agree. It's really hard to model these things. Even in a small compartment, it's difficult. And what about the whole building? That's almost impossible to account for extinguishing factors, the way how the water mist affects the chemistry of the reactions. And by the way, the conference also had a nice talk about the production of gases under water sprays given by Nichiri Inakonos-Tuburtira from Tokyo University of Sciences in Japan, who connected with us remotely, and it must have been very late for her. It was such a nice talk. But coming back to Max, you see all the time some people claim they just can place water miss sprinklers inside their fds simulations and simulate them like if it was nothing it's it's kind of uh let's say suspicious to me and i wouldn't go that far with my modeling i'm not really comfortable simulating extinguishing effects or more complex physics yeah, for the more simple things, like activation patterns, the CFD seems to be the really great fit of a tool. On the second day of the conference, there were other great talks, and another one that piqued my attention was talked by Simon Parolo, who talked about misprotection of bus garage, and he considered both the protection of the building as well as the protection of the vehicles that was really interesting and leaving the talk i've crashed into a fellow podcaster my colleague from poland shimon kokot who is a firefighter legend in poland and he's very heavily involved in training firefighters in here. As I had the microphone in my hand, I had to take the chance and I've asked him some hot questions about what he liked about the conference and what he thought about talking about the bus garages. Okay, so in the conference I found a real fireman watching from the side. With me is Szymon Kokot. Hi, Szymon. Hi. So what brought you to the Water Mist Conference? Yeah, you know, I've been publishing in the social media that I'm fulfilling my dreams because as an operational or more also involved with training firefighter, I know the benefits of mist. We are trying to convince firefighters what they are and to also limit water damage and so on and to have greater efficiency of firefighting so the name international water mist association was always appealing to me and actually it was my dream to at some point visit the conference so when i recently found out that this conference is being held in warsaw i said yeah this is my opportunity the closest one you can get exactly so what are your thoughts far? How do you see the developments in the water mist technology and the progress these guys are doing in spreading the solution to every time new and new types of facilities in which it can be used? Well, this is great to see. And actually, in the beginning, I was thinking that perhaps I will be only listening and that not all the topics will be very interesting to me. But I was wrong, to my pleasant surprise. Like today, there was a presentation on securing of bus depots with water mists, including perhaps some thoughts about internal solutions for the engine compartment or for the entire building. So that was very interesting because these are very problematic fires, especially with the perspective of new alternative fuels. They will be very problematic fires once they develop out of the incipient stage. So very much looking forward to these developments, which will in in any case, make the job of interventional firefighters a lot easier and a lot safer. It is really interesting that seriously consider the internal protection of the engine compartment, which means that, in a way, the layers of protection of the building extends to the fuel source because you're suddenly installing suppression inside your fuel source, which in this case is the bus. And that's a really intriguing concept. And in case of such an infrastructure as buses, trains, trams, I think that's a reasonable way to go to secure this. Because if you lose 100 buses in a huge fire, that's not only loss of money, but the problems for the city. Exactly. That's what he was also talking about. Over the years of working as a firefighter, I developed a kind of saying. So I quote myself, nobody never produces nothing with the thought that it will catch fire and burn. But we know that everything that humans produce will eventually catch fire and burn and we will go to this fire. So now I'm starting to see that actually the mist community is probably the only identified ally so far for the firefighters because they are trying to limit the threat before it develops. Also, what I noticed this recent presentation from a lady from Japan, she was talking about how the water mist can limit production of toxic gases. This is another issue that I'm interested in because, you know, I represent the CFBTPL Foundation. We work with cancer awareness of firefighters with new technologies. So this was also very much interesting. And last but not least, with the production of this music video, Close Before You Doze or the Polish version Zamknij Zanim Zasniesz I'm also discussing with some colleagues here the possibilities of engaging into the domain of public education in safety so like we're trying to see if there's a potential for already promoting the sprinklers in residential buildings and if not yet but eventually how we can draw a road map for already promoting the sprinklers in residential buildings, and if not yet, but eventually how we can draw a roadmap to this stage. But also let's start with, let's say, senior citizen care homes and such problematic, let's say, from the perspective of the fire protection kinds of buildings. And if I can ask you to be the spokesperson of your profession, how do you think the firefighters, and I'm talking more about the prevention side of firefighters, what are their thoughts about WaterMist? Do they treat it as another system that just works, or are there any doubts, legends, myths about the system? And if there are, how can we clarify them? about the system and if there are, how can we clarify them? All right. Yeah, well, that's a very responsible stance to take. I will say that to my best knowledge, the community of prevention engineers is well educated in the multiple benefits of water mist. So we always say that the best firefighter is the sprinkler, be it water or mist based, because it's always on the scene of the fire even before the fire is starting. That's the prerequisite or the idea behind the sprinkler. Well, I have some concerns which are connected to, let's say, portable intervention devices like we have Christian Inik here, there's Cobra, there are other systems, that at some stage of the fire development, and in case of water-based extinguishing systems, this leads to, let's say, design. If the design is not correct or not performance-based, I suppose, there can be a threat of the fire growing beyond the incipient stage. And then we are dealing with physics. There is only a limited amount of heat that can be taken away by one liter of water so if we were saying about liters per minute then perhaps this is the concern but then again the safety measure in that is good education meetings like this one exchange of knowledge and proper design and performance-based design. Didn't you once rip out the door of a compartment by putting some water mist inside through the change of the entity? Actually, I'm pretty sure there's a video. Oh, yeah, there is. There are actually two videos, but one is more spectacular. I'll link that in the show notes. All right, yeah. Maybe the water mist guys will not be happy that we're doing that, but, yeah, physics of fires are interesting. That was a not vented compartment so it was almost perfectly sealed with no windows and there was a large fire and we actually created a sort of an artificial situation where during open doors we created heat and during closed doors we created smoke and we repeated that like 10 times or something so we had a lot of hot smoke inside and by piercing the door with the piercing nozzle and applying water so it evaporates in the gases and not on the compartment boundaries we created a large vacuum a sub pressure that pulled the door inside out of hinges it was like a scene from a horror movie that's a very interesting manifestation of fire physics. Thanks, Shimon, and enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. So that funny story at the end of this talk with Shimon requires some explanation. And since we're in the fire science show, that's pretty fun fire science. When water evaporates, it creates steam that has a much larger volume, something like 1,700 times larger volume, something like 1700 times larger volume than the original water droplet. So when you evaporate water mist, you create a lot of steam gas. So you would expect that this steam gas will create an overpressure wherever that steam is formed. However, if you do that in a very hot air, which has low density because of its high temperature, and you start cooling that air by evaporating water in it, the air starts to implode because the density is increasing and the volume is smaller. So there's quite a fun interplay between the evaporation of water droplets and the change of density of the smoke and fire gases that you are cooling actively by including water mist into that layer. And there's a point at which instead of expanding, the mixture will actually collapse and will create massive underpressures. And that's what my friends did in that compartment where they ripped doors apart with this force of physics. So, yeah, that's a funny manifestation of fire science and not something you would expect in a normal operation or a normal fire. As Shimon mentioned, they've changed the physics a bit by opening and closing doors multiple times to have the high temperature and a lot of smoke at the same time in the compartment but yeah that's uh that's physics and that's that's what i really love about fire and this last interview pretty much summarizes the whole conference it was really nice event filled with great people great atmosphere it was so good to be physically present at the conference site again to interact with people have real coffee breaks and yeah i missed this a lot and i hoped we will be able to meet each other on conferences more often in the future i hope you enjoyed this podcast episode about the conference and for me it was crazy to record it. I feel the same like when I was recording my first podcast episode, because I'm pretty much clueless about what to do and how does one cover a conference. So I hope I didn't do a really bad job. A huge thank you to Bettina McDowell for inviting me for this event. Thank you so much, Bettina. It was a pleasure to cover your conference for my audience. I've really enjoyed it. I've really liked what I've learned about WaterMist. I see there is a bright future for this technology and that's what I wish to my WaterMist friends that they grow and prosper. And for you, FireSensual listeners, thanks for being here with me. Thanks for listening to this episode. If you would like me to cover more conferences in future, please let me know where should I go. Maybe I'll get an invitation and be able to give you an overview of what happened like just in this conference. And as usual, you will find me here next Wednesday and I have another great guest, another great episode, which you will enjoy a lot. Thank you so much. See you around. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
