 Hello and welcome to session 22 of the Fire Science Show. First thing first, thank you to all of you supporting Fire Science Show through five-star ratings, reviews, sharing the episodes with your friends or donating to the podcast through the podcast website. I really appreciate all the community support and I'm really happy that there is a community around this show that's rising up and that makes me very, very happy. Today, I have for you another interesting guest. You maybe remember episode 14 where I hosted Sarah McAllister and we went on a journey through the scales of fire phenomena. Let's say today's episode is a sequel to that. I am having a brilliant professor from University of California, Berkeley, where he has just achieved his tenure promotion. Today with me is Professor Mike Goldner, and we're going to talk about combustion again. But again, we're not going to focus on a single phenomenon, but we're gonna unravel how fluid mechanics plays a role in fundamental combustion what fundamental combustion is to fire safety engineering and what interesting outcomes come from this to every engineer so i really hope you will enjoy this episode and yeah let's not prolong this. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wo Professor Michael Gollner from University of California, Berkeley. Hi, Michael. Nice to see you. Hey, great to be here. Michael, nice to see you. Hey, great to be here. So cool that you've joined the show, and I'm really happy that it's just a few days after you've been promoted to your tenure track in Berkeley. That's amazing, man. Huge congratulations. Thank you. I hope I'm the first one interviewing you as a tenured professor. I think you are. I haven't done any interviews since, so I feel honored. Yeah, man. Next step, the Nobel Prize for your parking spot. But so far, it looks promising. Let's see. Let's see. Michael, I've invited you because you are quite familiar with combustion. I had in the show Sarah McAllister, who's taken me into a fantastic journey through the scales of fire phenomena. And she's a person who's living from burning up wood cribs. And then I thought, you're a guy who's living from burning up PMMA slabs. So that's pretty close. But I think these combustion topics are really fantastic because there is not that much exposure to fire professionals on fundamental combustion at least there was not that much in my education and that's what i would like to discuss however before we start i'm actually curious how much of fundamental combustion or fire phenomena you are teaching to your students who are pursuing like a master's in Mac engineering. Well, it really depends. So as you know, I was, uh, I could be in university of Maryland and there, you know, we had graduate courses in sort of all diffusion flames, but in combustion. And so masters and PhD focused on that. And undergrad, there was certainly quite a bit of combustion in the fire dynamics. And here at Berkeley, there are no fire classes. Hopefully next semester, I'll get to teach the first. So there is a wildfire taught in sort of the environmental science and policy side, but hopefully I'll get to teach the first engineering wildfire focus course in the next semester or two. And then we have traditional combustion, which used to be more energy and, you know, engine focused, but we're trying to transition this. My grad students, obviously, that are doing research, get a little more into detail, but I'd say as well that not all of my students are focused on fundamental combustion. I mean, we apply, it's such a mixed field, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, there's the combustion but in wildfires we're looking at risk analysis we're looking at emissions and it's our field is so interdisciplinary and tying things together so yeah but then mechanical engineering we do we do a bit of the fundamental combustion but i think it's a broader field and it takes a lot of perspectives put together. And if you go into the minds of a graduate fire protection engineer, you think this topic would be very relevant to them? I'm honestly curious because, as I mentioned, in my professional education in Poland, we had classes with the late Professor Koniecki, my further supervisor, who was teaching compartment fire dynamics, you know, Degel-Dreisdell style compartment fire dynamics. And that was a huge fun. I really loved it. But, you know, for mixed flames, diffusion flames, not so much. And then when I'm a consultant, I'm, let's say, a field engineer, I don't feel that I lack this knowledge. But every now and then, I meet a problem where without this fundamental knowledge on especially turbulent themes, it's difficult to solve the issue. And when I jump into modeling and fluid mechanics, it's something that we both do. I don't need this knowledge to run the CFD because it's a black box if I tell him to burn it will. But to understand what's happening in it, if I didn't get this knowledge elsewhere, I would have difficult time. So I wonder, from your perspective in graduate fire safety engineer curriculum, how much should they know about pretty fundamental combustion? Because you look to me like a combustion person. I look like a, yeah. Well, you know, this is always, this is the weird point. And I remember at an IFSS symposium, Professor Fernandez-Peyo, who's here with me at Berkeley, received the Emmons Award, gave a lecture and was saying how everyone always thought in the combustion community, oh, you're really in the fire community, in the fire community, oh, you're really in the combustion community. I feel like I myself will always be in between and now I have the wildfire and fluid. So you're in the triangle. Although I take back, I said that everyone has been kind and accepting and everything. I don't feel like anyone, you know, but at the same time, everyone has this assumption. It's hard in an interdisciplinary field. But going back, you know, no, I don't think an engineer needs to solve the partial differential equations so that he can formulate the Emmons problem. engineer needs to solve the partial differential equations so that he can formulate the emmons problem but you do have to understand what makes a fire burn okay where is the heat transfer coming why is the flame heating this up and making it spread and what are the limits because you have your textbook common you know fire problems and then you run into something new. You never want to be tricked into thinking something's just this common thing if there's something unusual. So I'll take, I'm sure something we'll talk about, inclined flame spread. And the rate of burning and how something's happening where the flame is based and fixed is different than what goes on up ahead. And in all the planes, it depends on the tilt of the flame and the ambient conditions. You don't need to be able to write the equations. I mean, in school, we're going to teach you to write the equations. But we want you to be able to think about it and to be able to understand that. And even for a firefighter, I think that intuitive knowledge is important because you get a sense of what the fire might be able to do and how it's behaving, how it's going to change in different types of fuels, how the ventilation conditions. And so I would stress, if you think of the mathy part, oh, you know, let's make sure they know the boundary conditions. Let's make sure they know how the equation is going to change. Even if you're not able to formulate it, you can think about it physically. And this is so important for modeling, like you mentioned. And that's, you know, this was the argument I made when I taught fluid mechanics to fire protection engineers. Why are we ever going to need this equation? Well, 25 years ago, a practicing engineer. No, you're not going to need to do more than pipes for sprinklers. Except, yeah, wait, you are because you're going to run a CFD code. And you put garbage into a black box, you get garbage out. How are you going to run a CFD code if you don't understand, you know, the basics, fluid mechanics, and what goes into a Navier-Stokes equation? Do you need to solve it for a CFD code? No, but you need to know the pieces that work and what's assumed and what's not because, you know, if you were installing a sprinkler system, if you don't think of the pressure at the head, I mean, you can arrive at so many, so many factors. And so I focus on that. I think people should have that fundamental understanding so they can think of what would happen and be surprised when something unusual happens and try to figure it out. I think that kind of knowledge is important for all fields dealing with fire. And let's face it, fire is kind of dangerous. It's good to get an intuitive sense of what's happening. However, that intuitive sense is very difficult in fire. This is my theory. People think in a linear manner, and fires are very nonlinear. And, for example, we're commissioning a road tunnel now in Poland. And we were doing a test fire in the tunnel in which we wanted to set a heat detector above where we were located with the fire so we've done approximately one megawatt pull fire in it and everyone was yeah that's not big enough that's really a small fire we need bigger fire to set that up okay so we've done like 1.3 megawatt fire a little bigger we've merged the pans together it was a bigger fire they were like no no no this fire is not that big so we've pushed it to together. It was a bigger fire. They were like, no, no, no, this fire is not that big. So we've pushed it to the limit, and from our pans we've received like something 1.7 megawatt fire. That's not a huge change if you consider it's only 400 kilowatts more. But at this fire, everyone was like, oh, my God, you're going to destroy the tunnel. That fire is too big. And I'm like, no, no, it's just, it's the same incremental rise as the previous one. It's just, you know, radiation is in the fourth power of temperature. So if we change the temperature by a few hundred degrees, you are starting to feel it on your skin. And this, if you don't know the fundamentals, if you don't recognize the fact that radiation is the fourth power of temperature, or that the plume flow is in the three hour above two power of heat release rate you lose the ability because you will think that things change linearly and they are not and the second story when i i discovered the importance of combustion and that segues to the inclined fires i approached the project in my career where we wanted to determine the consequences of a fire of a large screen that was hanged underneath a sports arena roof. You know, like these huge boxes they have in the middle of sports arenas. So I wanted to figure out what's the size of the fire of that thing. And there was absolutely no resources that would allow me. But it's made of like simple plastics, ABS or something. So I figured out, okay, let's calculate it. And okay, we made up the number at the end. I was not able to calculate that. So here, this inclined fire spread, if you are able to solve that, that's brilliant. And that's something you've done in your PhD, right? You were testing inclination aspect on the flame spread tell me how careful you stated would you say it solved it no not at all we found new nuances no I mean the point we came up with was that the burning rate in this pyrolysis region varies differently than the heating downstream. And so as you incline the fuel, it may spread fastest at a different angle than which it burns the fastest. So the heat release rate and the spread rate aren't necessarily correlated. And to me, this goes back to flammability. How do you classify flammability? Well, flammability now is to take into account geometry which we always knew it did for the thickness of a material but you incline it differently the fire may spread differently under earth gravity let's not even get into my okay no no we can get there later but you have to consider that the behavior of how the flame is centered over there and how the heat's transferred which has something to do with radiation and the shape of the flame, and then how it's transferred downstream, how the plume attaches and how that changes with the angle. Those two mechanisms sometimes are aligned of when they increase and other times they deviate. And so you can have flames that spread really fast, but don't have a high burning rate. And another time, you know, you can have flames that spread really fast, but don't have a high burning rate. And another time, you know, you can have the pull fire with a high burning rate, but almost no spread rate because it's the angle and the radiation. And so, you know, if you're saying flammability, it's very hard to say, do you mean the ignitability? Do you mean the potential heat release rate? Do you mean the maximum potential spread rate? Because sometimes the material, all of those are high. Sometimes only one of them is. And so I think it just goes back to what I was saying for combustion. You don't want to think of just an outcome. And that's why I sometimes hate pass-fail tests. I always like to think of them. I'm doing them for a living. I know. And we work with them too. But, you know, you want to get a number and you want to know why you have it so that you can really classify. I mean, there has to be a line drawn. That makes sense. I mean, you have to choose a line that works. But you also have to think that there's a reason why something is behaving worse or not. That allows you to improve it. And that allows you to think of, well, in a real situation, is this test actually testing reality or not? You know, so is this material going to be flammable in the situation that I'm applying it? Is it right next to a heat source? Is there something different? So that's why we see so much work in fire because that isn't always taken into consideration. And even though a material or something passed the test, it then fails and we have a lot of work. You've mentioned the pyrolysis zone and because I'm prepared, I know there's pyrolysis zone, flame zone and plume zone. pyrolysis zone, flame zone and plume zone but I would love if you could tell the listeners how these zones differ from each other and what's driving the phenomena in each, what differs and where's the boundary between them because you said that the spread may be not the same thing as the let's say, peak heat release rate, or you may have quicker spread or maybe larger heat release rate, but not necessarily at the same angle. So where would be that boundary that differentiates between the spread and the maximum heat release rate? That's like, wow, that's fascinating. Yeah, so when we talk about this, we're thinking about pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is just the burning material coming out. So as we know, you know, it's let's say we have a piece of plastic. So it's the solid plastic stuff that's burning, but it's not burning while it's a solid. It's being vaporized. So you're getting pyrolysis gases, as we call it. So flammable vapors are coming out from the heat from the fire or the surroundings, and those are igniting in the fire. Then we have what we call a diffusion flame. Oxygen, fuel, they meet together, they burn. It's not like your stove, which is premixed in beautiful blue. Instead, we get our sooty yellow flame. It's not perfect, but the fuel and oxygen meet. So let's imagine it's just this flat piece of plastic. You get the fire burning on top. You have that nice yellow flame. That whole region of the plastic burning, that's your pyrolysis zone. That's the area that's actually burning. Now, if you take that, the flame goes up. We call that a pool fire, right? The flame is rising up and there's all beautiful correlations for how high that flue might be. Now, if you tilt that and you put it vertically up, part of that is still that pyrolysis zone that's burning. And some of that flame goes up. Buoyancy is creating a flow and driving that flame up. But now that flame is no longer pointing straight in the air. It's pointing all along that surface because that surface is a vertical piece of plastic. And so all of that zone ahead of that burning region is getting hot, right? That flame is adding a lot of heat to the unburned or virgin material as it's often called in literature. So as that material heats up, it's eventually going to ignite and that's going to called in literature. So as that material heats up, it's eventually going to ignite, and that's going to cause flame spread. So flame spread is just this process. You have the burning. Depending on the geometry and the conditions, the flame has heat transfer to stuff that hasn't burned. Eventually, the stuff that hasn't burned ignites, and it spreads, and it can be constant. So in like what we call thermally thin so like a piece of paper it may burn sort of constant so the same amount of stuff is burning because it burns out really quick in a thick piece of plastic the plastic just keeps going and so that material can just accelerate because more and more stuff is burning over time. And a lot of times in like a wildfire, it is acceleratory over a slope because more and more material is burning as it goes up. And so even though we talk about solving for how fast a fire may spread, that number is just an estimate because really it's changing constantly over time as more and more things are being ignited. So those are sort of the stages when we think about it. And then the heating in any zone, they're not necessarily coupled. So the heating to the stuff that's burning, when it's a pool fire, you've got a big flame on top. And if it's radiation dominated, yeah, the bigger the flame, the radiation is going straight down into the pool. And so it's getting a lot of heat there. Now we tilt it vertically. And the area above, that's now getting a lot of heat from the flame. But the flame has stretched. So now there's less flame heating the burning region, but more heating the spreading region. And so you kind of have this balance. but more heating the spreading region. And so there you kind of have this balance. Some regions might have faster spread, but the burning rate starts to go down because the flame isn't heating it as well and vice versa. And it's not just by angle. It depends on how big it is. The bigger the flame, the more radiation, less convection. So these factors all play with each other. This theater of different heat transfer modes is fascinating. And to my fellow engineer practitioners, this is so more practical than you think. Because if you consider, for example, a facade fire, that's exactly what Michael described. It's a thin flame on the surface of a vertical body. And even if your facade, let's say, is incombustible, you still have this heat transfer to the facade, which, let's say, is aimed at destruction. It will cause some mechanical failure of the elements sooner or later. But now, we as the fire scientists or fire engineers, we're often, and I had a podcast episode about it, we're often focused on measuring temperatures. So if you plug a thin thermocouple into your inclined fire, into your pool fire, the number will be roughly the same, probably even higher in your vertical fire because of the better diffusion, right? But if you would calculate the heat transfer during a second of the burning to your surface element that's next to that, it could be much less. And as engineers, we often focus so much on temperatures and the temperature on my wall, the flame was like 500 degrees. That's horrible. But you never take into account that it was like five centimeter thin flame, which has a radiation factor of like 0.1 or something because it's very thin. So it doesn't really matter that temperature was that high. So it doesn't really matter that temperature was that high. And only when you are aware of this phenomena, you are able to actually quantify that threat, right? Right. And this isn't just in the fire protection field. I mean, in wildfire, which I do a lot of work, and here in California, there's an awful lot. You know, this temperature was much hotter. Was it really hotter? It was higher than melting point of steel. But it's all about the radiation and it's all about, I mean, in convection too, but it's about the heat flux. I'm teaching heat transfer to mechanical engineers this semester. And so explaining the importance of heat flux is a major goal of the class because temperature is going to be important if you're worried about the steel object and whether it starts to degrade or the glass and it's going to shatter or whether you're at the point of ignition of a material because a thermal theory works pretty well. But if you want to understand the heating and whether something will ignite, it's got to be heat flux, which is the rate of heating which causes that temperature rise. And so most people in the public don't understand that nuance, like you said. And it's critical to actually getting a fundamental understanding. And I was actually, before you said it, facade fires are just a perfect example of where this comes to play. And not just the facade, so you could have flames coming out of a window up ahead, you could have it burning over these flammable substrates they put on. But I think it was a student of Jose Torero when I first started at Maryland, visited and was working before everything was really well known about these facade fire issues where they were looking at flow and gaps. So what if you had a gap between two materials? Why would we have a cavity? Flammable facades, right? You fill it with expandable foam. The foam burns out. And now the heat's re-radiating. And the foam burns out super quickly and it drips. the heat's re-radiating and the foam burns out super quickly and it drips. And so even though it passed the test when you specially sealed it, you actually put it on a building, there's so many fire safety hazards there. Because scale matters. It's a different animal when you put it on a 10 meter long wall, three meter tall than a small sample in your facade test. And also, if you make a facade test and you are lucky with placing your cavity barriers just below the thermocouple levels, well, congratulations, you've passed the test. But, you know, it's difficult for me to do these statements because I know it's ridiculous and I run a fire lab. So I hope I don't get fired for this. But I mean, but this is what I'm saying. I mean, we need tests. We need to define a line between where we consider acceptable. Nothing's 100% safe. It's never going to be. But what's that acceptable level that we want to strive for where we can mitigate it? The people at the test labs, right? And the people designing, that's the job of the engineer to think about these issues and to make sure that they're judiciously choosing a test and judiciously designing the material. And if you think through the process of what a firebite do, you're doing some real due diligence, I think, of trying to design a safe system. There's always unexpected, but we keep learning. That's why we listen. There's new research, the codes get updated. But that's why I love tests that don't just give a pass-fail. But if we learn more, we might learn that we have to change that threshold, we have to modify, and it allows us to look back. That's one of the things that has carried through the podcast for a long time, that observation is surprisingly powerful. And maybe sometimes we should be more focused on seeing and understanding our experiments rather than putting a thousand thermocouples inside and just creating an unbearable plot of all of them. You've mentioned a few times the wildfires and that's a theme close to your heart. You also said that you're in this triangle of wildfire science, combustion, and fire safety engineering. That must be a fun position, actually. So for now, in our discussion, we had the inclined fuel, we had my huge screen or a bunch of plastic materials against the flame. But in wildfire, it gets more complicated because you're playing with porous fuels, which probably changes a lot, at least Sarah told me it does. How would this inclination play a role in wildfire? And maybe you can tell me, for example, in the crown fire, Maybe you can tell me, for example, in the Crown Fire, what really is driving the fire and what an engineer should know to have this intuitive understanding of what the fire could look like. Yeah, so I'll step back because if we want to teach for an engineer, so I was really lucky to have the opportunity to teach wildfire to engineers in Maryland. And, you know, the first thing to understand is you lose control in a wildfire. And I say that because in a building, we design a fire safe system and we estimate the fuel load. What fuels can you bring in? We have suppression systems. We have barrier walls. In a wildfire, you don't. The weather changes and every day the sun shines, the fuel load grows, right? Like it's it's continually growing. And then there's like ecological changes. And you say, oh, I'll add a fire break. Well, fire breaks don't help very much. I mean, it's more for firefighting and fire suppression to give those those gaps, unless the fire is pretty small, which it is sometimes, it doesn't help much. And so basics of wildfire, right? It can spread on the ground, it's known as surface fire, you know, either the smoldering fire on the surface, it can spread through the surface fuels like the brush, the grass, and the trees. And then it can also jump up to the crowns, which you mentioned. And so this crown fire is often considered extremely hazardous because the fire tends to race both because there's higher winds at the top of the crowns and there's less drag, and also because you've got incredibly loose fuels. Think of those pine needles, which also have flammable fuels in them that we haven't fully understood. Sarah McAllister, who was a previous guest, has looked into some of that. But it can spread incredibly rapidly through those very loose fuels. And it takes some extreme conditions. It has to be pretty dry. You have to have a fairly large fire that can jump up the snags and stuff into the crown. But when you get sustained crown fires, they do move very fast. And so, you know, in wildfire, we're often looking at spread rates. And so crown fires are very fast. And I don't think they're fully understood either. Another situation is that fires can be driven by wind and fires can be driven by slope. And so the wind makes sense. You blow more wind, the flame tilts ahead, eats more material faster, and spreads faster so long as the material's there. On a slope, the same thing happens, except it's not like the wind forces it. The fire pulls the wind and drives itself. And so there's a self-acceleratory process. And some of it can happen on flat ground too, with a big fire driving its own weather. But oftentimes on the slope, that's just a natural process where the fire, the buoyancy is pulling more air, which pushes the flame down. And so it drives itself and it doesn't move in a linear speed. It accelerates. It's not just like a 1D process either. it's not just like a 1D process either. So if we think of the flame and just like a flat plane spreading up, it's going to spread and it may accelerate. But what if you like curve in those walls and make it a ravine that's sloped? Well, now there's no air flowing in from the sides. Now that flame has nowhere really as the air is pushing in to go but just slam flat on the surface yeah and suddenly you're jetting hot flammable vapors far ahead of the flame front and it's just going to cause this dramatic acceleration and so looks like domingo's vegas in portugal and others have looked at become eru call them eruptive fires or accelerating fires. You know, I think eruptive is probably the wrong term, but there are situations for the slope fire spread where you can get very fast flame spread. And it loops back to fire protection engineering. There were a lot of investigations, particularly by Dougal Drysdale, after the King's Cross fire in London. Yeah. King's Cross fire occurred in the tube station where they had an escalator which was sloped up and the walls were all shellacked wood which was very flammable. And we still don't know if there was a pressure movement of the tube moving through. But essentially the fire was forced through that tube to move up. And it just spread incredibly rapidly because that flame is just pushed against the flammable materials, igniting more and more and accelerating. That can happen in wildfires too and have been the cause of some of these deadly burnovers because people don't expect it to just jump in the behavior. You're back to the intuitive understanding of a fire because this is a particular combination of conditions in which this particular flaming behavior can occur. If you didn't have this valley through which the wind would flow, you would not have this behavior. If it was free to ventilate through, you would not have this behavior. If you didn't have the fuel prepared for burning, you would not have this behavior. But it's these extremes in which people lose lives, actually. And that's common in not only wildfires. It's common in building fires. And in building fires also, it's not, well, for civilians, it's all in the fire growth where they usually lose their life being surprised by the fire and without the way of escape. But for firefighters, it's when the ventilation path changes. That's the difficult one. Someone opens the doors to the backyard or something at the lower level and suddenly the pressure plane drops in the building and it's all different for the people inside. That's how many firefighters lost their lives. There are phenomena like backdraft that are also intimately connected with this flow and fire theater and creating this explosive almost combination of fuel and oxygen that promotes very rapid burning that in the seconds changes the scene. So in wildfires, this is also probably something very dangerous for the people on the ground, right? It's the changes. And so it's often termed extreme fire behavior. And I think it was more recently redefined as basically any fire behavior that's unexpected. It's considered extreme. And so I talked about the fire, but let me tell you where wildfires are really challenging. Embers or firebrands. So it's not just the fire that you're tackling, but the fire will send flammable pieces high into the air and shower them ahead of the fire in locations unknown to start new fires. And this has also resulted not only in destruction of communities, but also in deaths of firefighters, because you don't expect the fire to pop up in front of you, and then it's behind you, and suddenly you have an entrapment situation. But there's a lot of research going on to these embers or firebrands, which are almost always smoldering. They can be flaming too, but they're smoldering pieces. They are lofted into the plume. They can literally go miles or kilometers ahead of the fire front and start new fires. And so that really changes the dynamic of how you think about it. Man, you're so good you could run the podcast on your own. That's like the next point on my list, spotting and firebrands. And I'm personally a huge fan of the work of Ali Tahidi and Nigel Kay and yourself on the firebrand aspect of wildfires and the spotting phenomena. And I think it's absolutely fascinating. And it's something that really ties the wildfire science to building science, because it's these little chunks of burning material that connect both worlds in many cases, right? So tell us a bit more about this phenomenon. How does it come to life and how in the hell the fire is able to throw a 20 centimeter chunk of wood over a distance of 9 kilometers? Because it's unbelievable. Well, you have to see fires to understand it. So you mentioned Ali Tahiti, who was a postdoc of mine and now is a professor at San Jose State, also here in the Bay Area in California, and Nigel Kay in Clemson University. And NIST does a lot of work. There's a small clique who works on these embers and firebrands. Any material as it burns out, cellulosic or woody material, is going to start to char and is going to smolder. Think of those glowing embers, the charcoal pieces. Just like your fire, you see the little sparks, the little things. Those are embers. They're just small. Now think of a fire that's blowing pretty hard and you have all those little sticks. The pine needles themselves, they burn out pretty quick. But the sticks and the bark and the pieces and the winds blowing as it chars and as it degrades, it starts to kind of crumple and crack and things break off. And some of those things, if a fire has 200 foot high flame lengths, I don't know how to convert that into meters, but it's very large. And suddenly you can lost something that's the size of a log or something. It's rare, but it can happen depending on the wind speeds. rare, but it can happen depending on the wind speeds. And so what happens is that just a blizzard or a shower of these materials can fly ahead if you have enough wind and a high enough plume. The fire itself is also pumping air up, right? It's buoyant and it can pump embers up too. And so some of them can get lofted into the larger atmospheric flow and land up ahead. And that's most of the basis of our Ember codes, like that predict where they go. We're all about what's the maximum distance they can go. So how far can they go in the plume before they run out of fuel and can't smolder anymore? There's a lot more that we try to do with that now. And it's not, you know, it's all sort of being added over time. But that was the basis of those ember codes and how we calculate how far they could go. But that's what happens. Those sticks degrade. And we did some experiments at IBHS, Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety in South Carolina. And they had this giant wind tunnel that can blow down a house. We were just burning basically christmas trees and they were running these experiments we got to record them and you can see as the as the fuel degrades the fire finishes and it's smoldering and so each stick just starts to like it starts to bend a little bit and it flies up flies up flies up and then you just get this shower from a single bush or a single tree. And imagine a whole forest. Now, a lot of them just land and do nothing, but a few may actually ignite and there's more closer to a fuel, but sometimes it can land far ahead. So it's so stochastic. It's so random, but so important. What's the lifetime of this particle when it lands? but so important. What's the lifetime of this particle when it lands? Is it like in seconds, minutes, hours? Depends on the size of the particle and the wind speed it's encountering. We don't want to go too far into technical detail, but yeah, it depends on how much fuel is in there. Remember, smoldering, if it's not flaming, is a slow process. So it can fester and smolder for a good period of time. It could be an hour scale. Because if it's not in seconds, but more in minutes or hours, it means these things can accumulate over time. And probably with every another ember that is trapped at a certain location of your building, you are creating this higher probability that they will transition to flaming and then create an ignition conditions for your building, right? And you said the next factor, right? So I was just talking about how they get generated, how they get lofted, but then eventually they ignite things. And so there's a lot of experiments where you like pile them up in in beds of pine needles if you get enough in a bed of pine needles and some wind poof they're always going to ignite in a bed of dry pine needles but on a structure it's pretty rare to get a single ember to ignite but if you get a couple or you get a pile then it starts to become more and more likely that your deck or something in a crevice is going to ignite. And igniting is this interesting process because you have a smoldering piece, which maybe doesn't have quite enough energy, and then you have more smoldering pieces added, and eventually that has enough heat to start to smolder the material it lands on, and then enough wind picks up where it transitions from smoldering to flaming, which to make our lives harder is, again, a very stochastic and completely, not completely random, but it's all probabilistic. You know, any experiment has to be rerun a bunch of times because one time it'll ignite, the next time it won't. So we would say it ignites maybe 60% after doing 30 experiments. You know, we, you know, transition to flaming is a really hard thing to characterize. But that's critical to whether you're going to start a new spot fire or you're going to ignite that part of a building. And, yeah, I think there's been some nice experiments by Sam san manzello and sayaka suzuki japan and at nist but they have this dragon so they throw a lot of embers at a structure and you can see them accumulate and then eventually ignite and and understanding that process you know helps us think about how we designed it's fascinating because if it was not hard enough you're now creating an aerodynamics problem of a building in in wind and where the under pressure zone will go and where the vortices will form around the building. And our buildings are not very aerodynamic. They're very vortice friendly in terms of where these things can land. And yeah, I saw pictures from I I think it was the Bay Area, where you were hit quite hard with wildfires. People were with these huge logs after a wildfire. It was really astounding that a fire can spread like this. But then again, I guess most of us don't appreciate the size of a large wildfire, like this really massive wildfire. Yeah, I mean, Berkeley here has a long history. The Tunnel Fire in 1991, which Pat Pagney, who was a big leader in the fire safety community for many years, investigated. And they found that a lot of the spread was driven by cedar shingles. So if you're not familiar familiar they're very light wood very we've tried them in the lab super easy to ignite and they break into little like wafers which just they're perfectly aerodynamic and so they're just going to float down the hill to the next one and and they will they won't even necessarily be smoldering they'll retain the flame pretty well and so it's a worst case scenario of something that's easy to ignite and flying the fire to your neighbor's house. And that was a really deadly incident just due to the timing. It wasn't huge as a fire, just the conditions and the smoke people couldn't get out. It's not always the big fires that are the worst and it's not all deadly fires that were big. It's another thing that goes into the intuitive seeing of the fires. It doesn't have to be big. On my list, I have one more final thing, and that's probably the coolest of them all, or maybe hottest of them all, actually. It's the fire wells. For some reason, I don't understand. You've made a scientific career on fire whales. They are super fascinating, super interesting and they come in so many different let's say flavors. And I really enjoyed your review on whale fires. They range from tiny ones to ones that devour cities. But there's this one that you have observed as the first, or your group has observed as the first, the blue fire whirl. And I remember it was really cool for the community because it was something from our community that went viral and it was everywhere. Everyone was talking about your blue whirls. Please tell me the story, how you guys have observed this for the first time, and what was your reaction to this discovery? Okay, well, this is a fun story. So I think most people know I was working on flame spread and things, and so a new colleague, Elena Ron, who's very well known in numerical combustion, explosions, high speed, so not fire at all. And we were chatting about things we'd like to do. And we also had some discussions with Alex Smith, another professor at Princeton, who was playing with fire worlds because he liked them. And he was from Australia originally and wanted to learn more. And we said, well, how can we work on this? You know, it's a fire safety issue in wildfires, but like tornadoes, you're not going to put them out. You're not going to, we already have an idea, you know, Saito and its others have a good grasp of where they can form. What do we do from here? And then we were with one of her postdocs, Wawa Zhao, and one of my grad students watching youtube videos literally and we saw a firewall form and a jim beam factory fire so this is a whiskey plant and it turns out we did some scary channel special later turns out when we investigated this the original distilled so they actually dilute it before they give it to you. So before they do that, it's very high alcohol content. And lightning struck this plant and the lake formed of it and a giant fire and a fire world spun. And when we looked at it, we saw, wow, it almost looks like it's eating that. And then somehow we got into the deep water horizon and we're looking at how they were cleaning up oil spills within sea chew burns, and something clicked, and we said, oh, maybe we can clean up oil spills with this. And that's what started it. We took a disaster and said, how could we use this phenomenon for good? And let's be honest, how could we get funding to do this work? We didn't get much. We stretched it thin as much as we can. And a grad student, Ram, who was amazing and used the support to do some amazing work on this. But what happened was a late night with Wawa, who's a postdoc and is now a professor at USc and jay who's now a professor in iat compar and they were playing with this and we're like well let's keep optimizing the fire world until we can get like really clean like how good can we get yeah and then one time the fire world just went and became this little perfectly blue spinning top on heptane i mean it's like gasoline it doesn't burn blue no it doesn't get pre-mixed on itself and so a lot of people have said oh we've observed that before as it goes down but i think something that changed was the fact that we did it over water it was perfectly smooth and the walls just like so the way you make a firewall in the lab is the walls are tangential so like the air comes in at opposite directions so it has to spin inside that chain and so just tweaking it over a couple weeks came up with this as a caveat soon after uh there's a little mishap some crude oil spilled on the side lit lit the experiment on fire. The fire department came. There was some delays. So luckily we had some very skilled people, and the fire extinguisher we were provided didn't work, so they had to run and get another one, which is why the smoke detector tripped. It's a long story. We have designed it so that that can't happen now, but another reason to think about what could happen in any experiment but the discovery of the blue world was was a fascinating and fun thing and i i think the encouragement uh that elaine aron my colleague there gave for us let's just dive into this new discovery rather than just going down the path of just you know characterizing let's just let's dig into this this is so interesting. And that's what we did. And we were able to publish it and understand it. And we've gone back. We're working on cleaning up oil spills with these larger fire worlds as well. And we've seen significant reductions in soot when we form them over recruit oil fires. But the blue world was this discovery that we've missed something in a behavior that we've been seeing because we changed the focus, we changed the approach. And into it, it was fun. That's fascinating. And in a way, understanding physics of this fire behavior is directly a pathway to technology because you mentioned it. It can be used to clean oil, but it's also very pure combustion when it's blue and if we can get less messy combustion it provides us ability to do things in let's say more environmental friendly way maybe not in terms of co2 but in terms of every other nasty thing that we emit while burning stuff so this is definitely much much appreciated and as I mentioned, the whales go into different flavors. There's also these huge whales that happen in wildfires or even city conflagrations. Is this something also that was of interest to your group? Well, I mean, in some ways. So you mentioned, so we had this review paper which we wrote for an overview of fluid mechanics. So it at a very fluid mechanics flavor of what what processes were driving the creation and how did they form it you know fire worlds form at all scales we see the little blue world in the centimeter scale i don't know if it can go much smaller we haven't seen that yet but it all the way up to kilometer scale in atmospheric flows and a colleague neil and, in the University of Nevada, Reno, is now doing more and more studies of these larger scale fire worlds that are at an atmospheric scale. They're literally tornadic, and there has been some devastating effects for them. But I feel like they're being seen more and more in fires as we get more of these extreme fires. You know, fire worlds are going to form, it's sort of this vortex phenomena, whenever you have the right conditions, you need that upward source of buoyancy, which is going to come from any fire, and you need something to generate that swirl. It could be the trees, it can be the wind, it can be the topography. So they often form on the backside of a slope on the edge of a fire as it's spreading. The wind's right. It'll spin them up and they kind of like run along the ends. And then if the whole shape of the fire is right and the wind is right, you can get these very large structures that form, which is sort of what they think happened. Like after the Tokyo Great Kanto earthquake fire, which was maybe 30,000 people dead or something terrible like that. We still don't understand everything about them, despite what we've done, which is fascinating. But I think a lot of the mechanisms that started, probably similar, but as we saw from the blue world, there's a lot of nuances in each process. As we saw from the blue world, there's a lot of nuances in each process. And so are we going to stop all the firewalls by understanding it? No, but we can still learn from it and learn where we might predict where there's a possibility. I mean, these larger scale ones, they see signs of it on radar. I mean, like this is... You can see the squirrely motion on the radar. Yeah. I mean, they see the same sort of signatures they look for for tornadoes. I mean, they're at an atmospheric scale, and we can fight over terminology. Are they still fire worlds if it comes from, you know, fire weather in or out from the ground? They come out of your department into the tornado department, so you're not allowed to play with them anymore. That's so cool. Man, the fire science is a fascinating place. To wrap it up, it's been an incredible journey from inclined surfaces to ground fires, spotting to fire wells, and there's so much more to learn on each of these phenomena and I usually ask people to refer to some resources but I actually know you have created an astounding base of resources at your Berkeley site so I probably linked that even before my description of an episode that's how good this site is. Here you have an airtime, advertise it as much as you want, and I will do more because it's amazing. Yeah, feel free. The firelab.berkeley.edu. A lot of resources are thanks to postdocs and students. Friends, Richter, who's a postdoc, came from Guillermo Raines' group where he's got he's got his PhD prepared a lot for new people interested in careers in fire science so yeah please check it out we post all of our papers too and I'm just you know happy to share it I think it's really exciting to be working on the interface between these combustion and physical science of fire and how we apply it and so that's also why we want to share the work is because we don't just want to do some esoteric fundamental work, but we want to figure out what the real problems are, understand them and find solutions and share them, act with the community. That's our goal. And I'm very thankful for creating this bunch of resources. I'm a user of them. I really appreciate putting them all in one place. And it's a really great initiative. And they're absolutely worth checking. It's the second best place after the podcast to learn about fire science. Definitely the fire science show first. I'm delighted that this came together. It's so nice to hear colleagues, especially in this time we can't travel as much. Hopefully these will be around for posterity. It's just to hear people's perspective on the research is rare and I appreciate it. As well as learning about other fields and how people are applying it in industry. We learn a lot. And the whole diversity of the fire sciences is just astounding. Okay, Michael, it was a huge pleasure to have you on the podcast. All the resources that we've talked about, the papers we've discussed will be linked in the show notes. Thank you so much again for being here and see you the next time. See you the next time. Cheers, man. See you the next time. And that's it. I hope you enjoyed that one. I really liked talking to Michael. He was on the list of my dream guests for the podcast for a very, very long time, pretty much since I've started the show. I always wanted to talk to him, and I admire him a lot. He has a great career path in fire and is definitely one of the young rising stars of our community. And I hope you understand why. His thoughts are really insightful and his research is really impactful on the world of fire safety engineering, wildfires and fundamental combustion as well. as well. For me, it was interesting to see how the fluid mechanics interplay with fundamental combustion and how all of this in the end is a flow phenomenon, a heat transfer phenomenon, and trying to find a way how to connect this with real-world engineering. And I think we found some really good examples in the show that really illustrate of how important these fundamental aspects of fire science are for everyday practitioners. And now for the end, I would like to highlight once more firelab.berkeley.edu. It's a brilliant web page filled with resources. I'm truly amazed how they've pulled it up together with Franz Richter. And it's definitely worth checking out. It's full of really useful stuff. So it really makes writing my show notes easier for this episode because everything is already out there. Anyway, thank you so much for listening to this episode. I hope you liked it. As usual, please share it with a friend and share the knowledge about the podcast. Next week, another great guest, another great episode. So, yeah, see you next Wednesday. Cheers. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
