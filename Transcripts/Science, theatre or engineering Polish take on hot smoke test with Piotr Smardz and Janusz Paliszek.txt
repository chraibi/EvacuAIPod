 Hello and welcome to the Fire Science Show. Happy New Year, everybody. Glad to be here with you in the new season of this podcast. Hope your winter holidays went well. Mine did. Filled with energy, ideas, and ready to kick some podcasts. So the topic of today's episode for me, myself, is a bomb, or a fire at least, and that is the hot smoke testing method. If you follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn, you sometimes see I post pictures with us doing fires in buildings. And sometimes I show this on conferences. And usually there are two reactions to people outside of Poland seeing this. Either it's like, wow, what's that? How do you make fires in buildings? What do you make them for? And people are just curious because they have never seen that. Or the second group is people who say, oh my God, hot smoke testing, that's a ridiculous concept. That's stupid. That's nothing like a real fire. That's a theater. That's a mockery of engineering. I rarely hear opinions like, wow, it's a great tool. It's so useful. I'm glad that we were doing that. But when I'm in Poland and I'm discussing here internally, it's completely different. Like everyone is happy with the method and everyone is using that. It's so common. I would put a claim that every single large building in Poland undergoes through these tests. I think we figured it out in here how to make the best use of that method, how to sacrifice some of the components that you think are necessary, like the ability to determine the capacity of the exhaust system, is it correct or not. Like you sacrifice this element and you gain so many options that allow you to test so many different things and smoke control just being one tiny puzzle of the building. So to discuss this today, I've invited two of my Polish friends, Piotr Smarcz and Janusz Paliszek from a Polish engineering company in Bepo. They are chartered fire experts in here, and they run a successful engineering company, probably my biggest competitor in terms of hot smoke testing, so that's kind of funny. We get together to sit down and discuss this method, but it's quite funny that we share the views on the method actually we didn't develop it together each of us went through their own path with with this and we actually reached the same conclusions and and we agreed pretty much on how this can be used so, please join me in this discussion on why hot smoke tests are actually not that bad thing and how they can be used to generate safety in buildings. Because after all, in Poland it works. We have countless investors who pay us money for a test that is not required by law, that is usually annoying because it points to errors, that creates additional complexities and actions to be taken at the very end of your construction of your building. And yet they do ask for these tests and they're routinely performed because the gains from them are just so much bigger than the hassle this creates on the construction work. Anyway, that's enough of an intro. Let's go with an episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynsski and I will be your host. Hello guys, welcome to FireScience show after the short Christmas break. Welcome to the new year and I'm happy to be here with you and today with me two of my good friends, Piotr Smarcz and Janusz Paliszek of Inbepo, Polish fire expert company. Hello, Wojtek. Hello to you and to others and happy new year. Happy new year. So we're here today to discuss an interesting aspect of fire engineering and to my best reflection it's a very polish thing actually in a way and that is hot smoke tests and it's something that we hear love and the rest of the world hates in a way and for me it was always surprising that this method does not have that much love outside of poland as it has in here first, I would love to ask you how it started for you guys. When did you start doing hot smoke tests and what were your initial experiences in doing that? Well, we first sort of became aware of hot smoke tests while still working in Ireland. In the early 2000s, both Janusz and myself, we were actually working as fire safety consultants in Dublin, in Ireland. And on one of the projects, actually on two projects, prison projects, interestingly, that we were involved, such hot smoke tests were requested by the client and they were carried out. And this was really the first chance for us to become familiar with the methodology, with the concept. It must be said that hot smoke tests were not very common in Ireland at the time. And they are, in fact, not that common still today. As you said yourself, in many countries outside Poland and maybe Australia and a couple more, hot smoke tests are not very common. And then shortly afterwards, we moved back to Poland. We actually realized that there will be a market for hot smoke tests. And we started purchasing the equipment. And actually, because at the time there was a lot of progress in Poland in smoke control design in general, we could see that there will be a market for such tests. And so we started doing them as did ITB around probably roughly the same time. From my perspective, it was similar. I joined ITB in 2010, and my previous boss, Grzegorz Starba, was already doing them in Poland. So I've joined a team that was already performing these types of activities. But also, in relation to smoke control, you mentioned that smoke control was booming in Poland at the time, and it's true that it was around the time when we've introduced performance-based engineering in Poland for smoke control, which I would assume had an impact on new technologies being used for also verification of the systems. But now, today, I know that hot smoke test is not that much about smoke control, or maybe not primarily about smoke control. When did you realize that this tool goes beyond the smoke control system capabilities, that it actually could be something more than just testing? Yes, I think it's fair to say that when you just do even the first few tests, maybe in different buildings, we started with a shopping center, with a car park. You realize that a lot of phenomena that you sort of read about in the handbooks of maybe smoke control design, that you can actually see them. I'm talking about things like a spill plume, like distortion of a smoke layer by incoming air and so on and so forth. So I think probably for both of us, it's fair to say that quite early in doing the test, we realized that it's not only a tool to check something, but actually a very good tool to learn about things that, as you said yourself at the time, things like CFD simulations that were becoming more widely used in Poland. So it was really, you know, the two methods were complementing one another quite. And in terms of how we are doing the hot smoke tests, I often in the discussions, I use the term Polish method. And I didn't coin that one. It was some people in Graz conference in Austria who started calling this particular way of doing the hot smoke test as the Polish method, which made me very happy. And I've picked the term. So maybe you can bring the listeners on what the Polish hot smoke method is. Like, what's the basics? How does it work? Actually, what I can say myself about the Polish method, I would call it much more Australian method. Australian method. Basically, the methodology is quite nicely described in Australian Standard 4391 from 1999. 4391 from 1999. All the methodology is very nicely introduced in this standard. Basically, we just adopted that method. I would say fully or nearly in all extent. What we do, we just burn in some traces alcohol, which gives us a heat source. Although I have to admit that there are different types of the heat sources. They can be just gas burners or heaters, electrical heaters, or as I said, an alcohol. And also we use like a tracer, a white smoke, which is provided into the smoke plume. And that's more or less how the methodology of the testing works. What we also do, we also record the entire test, just videotaping it, just to have the evidence of the outcomings and observation because during the test because usually the objects are quite large it's not really possible to see every little happenings taking place during the tests we have to take measures usually there is plenty of people doing so some people are just measuring the air flow velocity. Some people are just trying to take the notes about the action we take place during the test, including how the fire grows when we switch on the smoke generators, when we set up the fire, when the alarm starts, when the steering of the smoke control system starts, and other systems, like smoke detection, fire detection, fire alarm system, and so on and so forth. So, in all together, this is quite complex things where we can just watch and witness and experience situation which is close to the real fire, but it's not a real fire. I absolutely love that it took you 30 seconds to describe the smoke generation and the heat source, and then you went on and on about the things that happened during the test. And I find it is an amazing way to summarize what the hot smoke test is. It's not about releasing the smoke in the building. It's about what happens in the building when you do that. And I think this is something that makes a difference between the approach we are using it and how we are using it and what for we are using that in Poland compared to other countries in which they don't like it because it's theatrical, because it's just an illustration of a fire, or someone is trying to prove that in a real fire, something will act in a certain way when we were not truly reproducing a real fire, or not fire of a full size. One thing I wanted to add, I mean, you are very right, this is not the real fire, but we still can have a relatively large test fire in a building. And what the Australian standard AS4291 puts really stress on is that you need to do this safely. So there is a number of actually of safeguards. The metal trays are actually in a water bath. There is a number of safeguards you need to ensure that they are in place in order to do this safely. And there is the entire methodology in the test helping you to select the right fire size, test fire size, that will be large enough to be as close to the actual fire as can be, but at the same time that will not damage your installations that are probably already in the building, that will not activate the sprinklers, because quite often you do this in a sprinkler building. So while you are right that this is smaller and of course the test is not about just producing the smoke. It is important to recognize that the standard really gives you a methodology how to do this safely and in a controlled and repeatable manner. how to do this safely and in a controlled and repeatable manner. If I remember correctly, one day I was searching for the origins of the standard and I came upon a paper from some people from Melbourne Fire Brigade. That was like 1995 or something. And they were doing these methylated spirits experiments in water-stabilized pool fires. And this gave the origin to all these traces and fire sizes and everything that's in the standard. So I've actually started with some pretty neat fire science in there. In ITB, we're following that methodology, or maybe we're doing it in a similar way as the Australian standard would describe it. We use our own fire sources. Like we've done the exercise myself and we've measured the heat release rates from our trays. We don't water stabilize them because we use mixtures of alcohols that we know how they burn. We know how long they will burn, what temperatures we're going to get. So it was quite a bit of exercise from our side to engineer this. But it was necessary to simplify the test, you know, and cut off the additional that make the test more complex and harder to set up. Because later in the talk, I guess I'll try to convince you that the quick smoke test is better than the complex and a slow one. But before we go there, I wanted to comment on the different methodologies used around the world, Before we go there, I wanted to comment on the different methodologies used around the world, because it's obviously not the only way to smoke your buildings up. From very simple things like using pyrotechnics in your building, like smoke flares and firework type materials, which I highly don't recommend because they are dangerous in terms of toxicology and the smoke made by them is very persistent. of toxicology and the smoke made by them is very persistent. Through something I really love, the Austrian tunnel hot smoke test methodology, where you literally put 20 liter gasoline, 40 liter diesel in a two square meter pan, you set it on fire and it is a real fire. And that one is absolutely crazy. And up to very complex tools used to generate smoke in buildings. I don't know if you've ever seen that, but there are people that I know in Spain that develop the machine to generate smoke, which incorporates both the heater and the smoke generators inside, and that's actually quite a crazy concept that you have it on one card, and that's probably the pinnacle of how mobile the method can get. So there are many ways of putting your smoke into the building. For me myself, the important aspect is that we have a buoyant plume of smoke. So we see this layered behavior of smoke that is more or less representing the physics of a real fire. And the other thing is that we activate many things at the same time. Like, we don't, this test is a global test of a building, not a local test of a single sensor. And for me, that's the groundbreaking thing about it. But the true question is, does it have to be a real fire to be useful in a building, to be a valuable thing to do in your building? Does it have to be a real fire? Well, you know, I can say that the best option would be if the fire would be a real fire. Unfortunately, we are not really able to witness the fires and experience the fires the same way as the firefighters. That's the only people who have the real connection with fire. As we are fire safety engineers, we need to use tools. And for ourselves, the hot smoke test is just a tool. It's a tool which replicates the possibility of the fire. So my answer is, we're not really providing the conditions exactly the same as during a real fire situation. Mostly this is related to the thing which Peter already said before, which is related to the possible damage to the object. Obviously, it's possible physically to create a large fire, but the question is if we are going to have this large test fire under control. That's the first question, and I would guess not really. And the second question, which is just a consequence of the first answer, is what damage are we going to make to the building itself? We have to always say that basically the time when we get into the object to provide the test is at the latest stage of the construction. Just right at the handover. Not always the building is fully ready to be open, but at the same time, all the systems should be working correctly. One thing I would add to that is that, okay, people sometimes say that, okay, this is not the real fire, because my design fire is 5 or 10 or whatever megawatt, and yours is, I don't know, maybe 1 megawatt or maybe so. I think that really misses a point on sort of two accounts. First of all, as Janusz said, it's just not practical to have the real fire in the building. And also, we sometimes miss the fact that we assume fires to be growing fires. Very often this concept of square fire is adopted. We recognize the fact that fire is small at the beginning and then it grows, the heat output grows and so on. So we must realize that this fire size that typically can be used in a hot smoke test, say maybe between 300 kilowatt and maybe one megawatt. That is not really far off the fire size that you will on average have in the first few minutes. And the first few minutes is actually the time when people evacuate. And at least in the Polish regulatory framework, that's the time that you, for example, analyze for your evacuation conditions. So I would actually argue that although, okay, we will not even get close to the maximum heat output that we designed the system for, in fact, we will not be that far off. And certainly what we are producing with this hot or, say, warm smoke is much closer to reality because it's a buoyant smoke layer compared to a situation where you just introduce what is called like a cold smoke test, where people just introduce smoke. That is just filling the space with smoke, but it bears no resemblance to actual fire. So I think hot smoke test methodology is much, much closer to a real fire, although it must be admitted that it's not the fire size we normally design. If I can just add something else, it's basically that maybe we do not replicate the real fire, but at the same time we can be close to the design fire, including the growing part. Like having a couple of traces with the fuel of heat sources, we can switch on, one by one, all the heat sources, just trying to replicate the fire growth to the size which is obviously possible for the test itself. So we can observe and we can analyze the situation in a real building as during the design stage when, for example, somebody is doing CFD. So basically what is very important, this is quite a good CFD verification tool. I like how you framed it for the interesting part from the life safety perspective, which is the growing phase of the fire. It may be not such a bad representation. And you've also mentioned sprinkler buildings in which you would guess that at some point the sprinkler gains the control over the fire size. So you might actually be quite close to that. Obviously, we don't simulate cooling effects of the sprinklers unless you trigger them. We've actually did that twice, unfortunately, out of more than a thousand tests, so it's not a horrible outcome statistics for you. But yeah, twice we've witnessed a wet smoke test. I've asked you the question about the realness of the fire, because looking through the literature or even reviewing papers recently, I see people trying to justify the design of smoke control system with a hot smoke test. People claim that, OK, this particular system has worked well with this particular size of a hot smoke test. So the design is valid. And for me, I don't like this approach. I also know about approaches where people try to measure like temperature profile along the height of the build or try to do some very complex measurements of flows and other things and justify, okay, in my hot smoke test, I have achieved this height of smoke layer. So if a real fire had like 10 megawatt, the layer height would be at this size, based on fundamental like Froude number calculations or just by an experience. For me, at one hand, it may be where the host was originated from, because if you go back to work of De Smet and Morgan, they've used it in this way. But for me, it kills the purpose. Like I am personally completely happy giving up the capability of verifying if smoke control capacity is good or not, because I've already done that with CFD or someone else has done that with CFD and focus on other things rather than make my hot smoke test extremely complex and try to prove that this efficiency is good. I must say that we have not come across such a demand, say, from our clients or maybe from the authority, from the fire brigade witnessing the test. But we are aware of that discussion, as you said, especially in the UK and the paper Howard Morgan and Jean-Claude Desmet published sort of suggesting this methodology. I must say that I would agree with what you just said. with what you just said. I mean, we must, and we are trying to explain this to people, that the hot smoke test is not really a verification of the overall efficiency and the fact that the system is sufficiently sized, okay? Because the capability of the system is sufficient. Because at the end of the day, will probably be an order of magnitude below what the design fire is. I mean, just to give you an example, say in a car park, you design it for maybe, depending on the situation, say between four, let's say, and 10 megawatts, roughly speaking, okay? The test in a typical car park, especially with sprinklers, you will normally be limited to maximum of maybe below 500, like one large tray would be 340 kilowatts. So that's 10 times less than the design fire so we are not claiming that this is the real fire but the fact that we introduce a large amount of smoke that this smoke maybe can migrate to adjacent smoke zone we will be able to for example if the system is incorrectly programmed we will be able to demonstrate that because maybe we will activate the smoke extract in adjacent zone where it was not intended to so i think it's fair to demonstrate that because maybe we will activate the smoke extract in adjacent zone where it was not intended to. So I think it's fair to say that we are not in any way trying to prove that the system works. As you said, this is done typically by either hand calculation or a CFD in case of, say, car park. It would more typically be a CFD model. But what also Janusz mentioned is that you can validate that model to some extent, obviously not comparing your design simulation with your hot smoke test, but if you in the same computer model, if you introduce a smaller fire, which is representative of what you did in the hot smoke test, and you get similar results, they will be different from your original simulation, but if you compare them with the results of the hot smoke test, that will be a nice validation of what you have done in modeling. So that's the way we would look at it. We believe that the hot smoke test is a very nice verification tool for the analysis and design of the smoke control system. Always the hot smoke test takes priority in terms of the results, rather than CFD analysis or the design itself. Because it happens in the real building, we would say real environmental conditions. Not exactly with the size of the fire, of course, but it happens in the real life. So whatever happens in the real life is more realistic than whatever happens in the virtual reality. Well, in the sense that your decisions do not include problems with programming of the system, for example. I think we have the biggest difference actually in tunnels. In ITB, we had a tunnel just recently in Warsaw which was designed for a 100 megawatt fire. Okay, we could go crazy with our hot smoke test because we've done 2 megawatts in it and it was scary that the fire was like 4 meters tall and it was like, yeah, it was a big fire. I wouldn't do that in a car park. I would not recommend that in a car park. However, I know that in Singapore, they actually do that, large fires in car parks, and I admire them. I would love to be invited to one of them to witness that. However, in a tunnel, we do two megawatts. You design for 100 megawatts, and you usually focus on concepts like back layering or just general where the smoke will go in a tunnel. And there is absolutely no way you can compare 2 megawatt fire to 100 megawatt fire. That is completely different physics. And it's not only a negative physics. And it's kind of funny, but sometimes with a bigger fire, the system would have better performance because you would exhaust more volume of the air because your exhaust has constant mass exhaust rate. The smoke cools down as it flows through the channel. So sometimes the systems in tunnels at the inlets, they have higher capacity at high temperature than they have in low temperature. The chimney effect will be completely different. The way how smoke will block the airflow is in tunnels, the air coming from both sides of the tunnel is the most difficult thing to manage. And a huge fire is a block for that air, so it makes controlling that easier. It's completely different physics than you would have in a small hot smoke test. And yet, you can test a lot of things, but you cannot really prove the physics is correct. And I assume it would be the same in shopping malls where you have spill plumes, and the physics will be completely different in a large fire. Like in large open plant buildings where you have very tall, buoyant plumes and the physics will be different. So catching the real behavior of a fire is not always possible, but also not always necessary. So coming back to the bullseye you've hit with the programming. When I was doing hot smoke tests, when I was learning hot smoke tests, I have learned the immense amount of ways you can screw up a system in a building. You know, you can make so many things go wrong in ways that a normal fire engineer would never expect. We assume that things work in the building. When I design smoke control system, I assume that the smoke detection system will be working and will pick up the fire. Yeah. If I have compartmentation in my car park, I assume that the gates closing them will close. Right. And these are the things I don't even think about. I just assume they work. And yet in the buildings, they often don't. I don't know. Do you guys make a statistic of how many times something went wrong in a hot smoke test? We used to do that in ITB, and we were, after a few hundred tests, we were like at 80% non-working, which was a horrible statistic, and we've stopped. I don't know, what's your experience with automation in a building failing, in a way? Well, we do not sort of keep track on it and we do not calculate any statistics but we would agree especially i mean we we see this often in practical terms on building sites that are just about to become operational buildings that there is this push from the contractor to get you on board as early as possible but you end up going to a building which is really not ready for this test, to be quite honest. So it very often happens in our case that we do this sort of preliminary test. It turns out that some things are done incorrectly, that maybe this or that is programmed incorrectly or installed incorrectly. And we end up coming there again and doing the actual test that ends up in the documentation as the official test that was carried out. But yes, I mean, very often it's funny because theoretically you go to a building that the systems were already checked. Someone may went there with an thermometer and someone was supposed to anyway, yeah, to go and check that the airflow through the extract grill is such and such, that the incoming air is in fact incoming and so on and so forth. But you end up seeing in the test that there is maybe no airflow or worse still, someone measured that there is an airflow, but just in this particular fire scenario, it should be the other way around. Because as you know, in reversible systems, very often in one fire scenario, a particular point will be an inlet for fresh air. But in other situation, in other fire scenarios, that will be an extract point. So that is really what you can see quite clearly in the tests. Also, things like excessive velocity, for example, of replacement air in that. Again, that is something that you see quite often. That is more probably a design problem rather than installation problem. But that's something I think is one of the biggest points. Incorrect placement and size and operation of replacement and air inlets is probably a bigger problem than incorrect placement of extraction points, I would argue. Absolutely. Absolutely that. And coming back to the the automation people, that's my opinion people don't really appreciate the complexity of fire systems in large buildings if you have an airport or a shopping mall, like a really large complex multifunctional building the smoke automation systems inside are crazy complex, we are talking about thousands of sensors each of them has an address. Each of them is designed to a certain zone in the building. Each of them has to be working, has to not be in a failure mode, and has to actually be giving the correct alarm when it's triggered. You have countless, countless dampers on your ducts, which have to close or open accordingly in every scenario. And in many scenarios, it will be a completely different operation, like you mentioned. One scenario, you're exhausting air through a duct. Another scenario, you're pushing the air through the duct. In one scenario, you want this damper closed. In another, you want this damper open. And you have hundreds of dampers to program in your building, and it takes a single human error, you know, that this inlet was supposed to be closed, but it's open. And suddenly the system behaves completely different in a fire, in a hot smoke test, than you would expect it to be. The same thing goes with the direction of the fans, and especially in terms of Jet fans. I mean, to the listeners, it might sound hilarious to you that someone can program a fan incorrectly, that it goes to the wrong way. But trust me, this happens more often than you would think. And in a hot smoke test, it takes one hot smoke test to figure it out, the direction of all the fans and their combined effect in a car park. So it really makes checking these errors very easy, whereas if you wanted to do it hand by hand, device by device, it's usually very labor consuming. And Piotr, you've mentioned the air, inlet air. This, I would, like you said, it's more a design thing. I would put it into physics, not automation. Because usually the air is, let's say, the air is coming through where we expected it to be coming from. However, commonly, the velocity of that air is much higher than would be correct. And I don't know why it is designed like that. I don't think there is a good unified guideline of what the velocity would be. Or maybe the guidelines exist and they say it's one meter per second, which no one likes, because it leads to huge, huge openings in your walls. But truly, that is something that you can observe a lot in hot smoke tests. Whenever you have an inlet with like three, four, five meters per second airflow velocity, and you place your hot smoke test anywhere near that, you see extreme mixing of smoke, which should have been buoyant and should flow up into the ceiling, but it's not flowing up because it's being captured by the inflowing air, and then suddenly your whole room is in smoke. We've observed that in so many buildings, and in so many buildings it was the main issue with the systems. And in fact, the designer, I'm not even sure if it was design error. Like, probably, okay, if you'd done CFD better, if you were more conservative with the assumptions, you would do it better. That's something we have seen with Janusz really a lot. I mean, you just realize doing hot smoke tests how profound effect on the smoke plume the incoming air can have. And it's not only that you should have sufficient size of the inlet so that the velocity is relatively low. And in Poland, that is, there is a lot of confusion about, you know, what is the right value. Some people claim that five meters per second is great because that figure, as you know, is in the UK design guideline documents and so on. But that's really just referring to velocity that is not obstructing people in crossing maybe a doorway or a gate. If you introduce air at five meters per second close to the fire or close to the smoke plume, you will completely distort it. And in fact, I think it's fair to say that we have seen buildings where the situation in terms of smoke logging was better before starting the smoke ventilation system than after. So you can really distort and you can really completely damage this flow of smoke under the ceiling, in the spill plume, in the axisymmetric plume, if you have excessive air. Yeah, in CFD you may not appreciate that that much, because as I mentioned before, you have high heat release rate of your smoke plume, so maybe the buoyancy is larger, maybe it's a little tougher to distort the plume. so maybe the buoyancy is larger, maybe it's a little tougher to distort the plume. And it's also not that dramatic as when you are in a compartment that's filling with smoke and it's obvious it's wrong. It really strikes you when you see that in a hot smoke test. And it's one of the things that we find most commonly during the hot smoke test. The other thing that we find very commonly, and for me this is probably the most horrifying, in fact, aspect of fire automation in buildings, is that there is this assumption that there will be one fire in the building at a time. Like that's the golden rule. We design for a single threat in a fire compartment that I'm in, or let's say a zone of the building that I'm in, and then the smoke migrates outside of that zone, then the system should ignore that new information and should just keep removing the smoke from where it has started. And then, in many buildings, I don't know the reason why, but we had situations in which the secondary detection in another compartment has caused stop of the systems in the one we were burning in and started the systems in the neighboring compartment. And then the fire moved to another one, the smoke moved to another one, and the same thing happened again and again. So the system was operating in a remote area of the building when it should have been operating in the area where we were doing the hot smoke test and why this is so dramatic because this is actually a fault that could lead to a loss of life you stop protecting the area where you have the fire and you start the systems in a different area and you actually create additional threat in the area where you were before because suddenly maybe you will start putting air inside that area, because in the other scenario, it acts as an inlet. And I would think it's a very exotic thing to happen. But no, actually, I've seen it on multiple buildings, like more than a dozen. And some of them were like really important buildings or critical buildings, you may say. So you would assume no one would have done that mistake. And I don't know where the mistake came from. Was it the automation people? I don't think it was the designer's mistake. I think it was the mistake in how the system was executed in the building. But this is something that you would have never, ever captured if you were going a smoke sensor after smoke sensor with a little stick with a smoke can in your hand, like triggering a sensor after a sensor one by one. You would never capture that. You need to fill the building with smoke to observe such effects. And for me, this was the most horrifying experience I've had during hot smoke test. Like this really could, if this happened in real fire, it could take lives. Did you guys come against such big mistakes in system automation that were critical for the building during Hotspot Test? Yes, of course. I have to agree with you and also disagree with one thing. You said that you don't really understand how it happens. We understood. Basically, talking to people who were responsible for putting the fire matrix into working stage, for them it's very easy. When they look at the fire matrix, they see if the detection is in this area, this happens. If the detection is in the other area, another scenario happens. So what happens is basically they do not understand the simple principle, which you said very early before, that we assume that there is only one fire location. We know this as the fire safety engineers, but it appears that due to the lack of sharing that knowledge in a much more wide area, the people, for example, responsible for the fire matrix and fire control, they do not really know that basic. What happens is basically the situation when the fire or smoke control zone starts one after the other and after the other, so on and so forth. We had this experience ourselves. Once we were doing the hot smoke test in one of the shopping centers, quite large, which was incorporating two mechanical smoke control zones, both being designed for 400,000 cubic meters per hour. Due to the smoke migration from one zone to the other, the smoke extraction started in the adjacent smoke control zone, doubling up to 800,000 cubic meters per hour extract volume. What does it mean? You have exactly the same inlets, which you were talking about, that usually they are small. Now, if you multiply those already crazy velocities, but twice, you get even more difficult conditions inside. What happens was we had basically a fog, a foggy place. Although the extraction volume was huge, but it couldn't work sufficiently. I also would like to talk about this, what you said before, in terms of the hot smoke test fire size. Basically, there is a plate of spaces which you can prove that the smoke control system is designed for some minimum size of the fire. If the fire is smaller than some amount of the energy which is provided to the volume, the smoke control system doesn't work. And how can you observe this? It's a foggy place. And sometimes even the mechanical ventilation system doesn't help. So I would say that yes, we went across it. We know the answer. There is no full cooperation between all the design members, including the M&E people who usually incorporate the guys responsible for providing the fire matrix. But I would say the guys being on the contractor side, they usually have no connection with fire safety engineers. You mentioned education and they don't know that. And actually, that's a funny consequence of hot smoke test. These errors are so striking, so obvious during a hot smoke test. You cannot just pretend it didn't happen. Like you have your whole building in smoke, and you cannot find your way out, and you realize that something is not working. So the more hot smoke tests you do, the more contractors witness this state of mind, the better the overall engineering is in the country because they do less and less of these errors. However, it still can be a considerable amount. For the last 20 minutes, we've been talking about all the things that go wrong with the automations, last 20 minutes, we've been talking about all the things that go wrong with the automations, all the small issues that happen with the building that actually make the systems not work correctly, all the errors. Now, one could argue that you can find these errors without a hot smoke test, because I guess you can. You can go on and measure every point in every scenario, Because I guess you can. You can go on and measure every point in every scenario. But it would be just so much more labor intense than just doing a hot smoke test. Then for me, the hot smoke test is a really valuable thing. And the second thing is the hot smoke does not lie. You cannot convince smoke to not stagnate somewhere or to not flow in a place it shouldn't where the physics make it flow there. And it's also very obvious to point it to other people that, look, this is an error in your system. You have to fix it because there is no way they can pretend they do not see it. So I see an immense value in here. And I would like to make a course that because of all these issues that happen in the building, because of all these automation errors, because all of these simple problems like with inlet air or air balance or pressure that you find in your buildings, that quick and robust hot smoke test method is extremely valuable to the building. And this is exactly why our methodology has evolved from the overly complex setup of Howard and Morgan, from these measurements of temperatures, planes, very complex setups that take you one day to set up, then one day of an experiment, one day to take off, into a method that takes 15 minutes to set up. Let's say an hour to perform the test and then you move on. You can do five tests a day per building and suddenly you become very efficient in testing buildings part by part. So in the end, you can actually test it fully. So it's not just a sample that we've done one test in a basement, one test in an office, but you can truly like test the whole building with this. And from my experience, this is where the benefits of this method come into play. That you suddenly have a tool to verify if the building has reached the zero level of safety that it was designed with. The line which designers drawn by designing all the systems, thus the building has this minimum level. And for me, this is so, so much more powerful than just a theatrical representation of a smoke in the building or trying to convince someone that the exhaust rate is correct. For me, that is the whole smoke testing. I hope you guys agree with that. Yes, although I would say that I think at least in the Polish legal framework, I mean, that sort of laborious and systematic checking of the system still needs to be done. It's just part of the commissioning process. But the hot smoke test is like a second layer of verification. It's like another, I suppose, something extra that you can do to make sure that, in fact, that all works together. Because, as we said certain things like for example migration of smoke which we really see a lot be it through a leaky a curtain or a smoke curtain which is not deep enough or even through lift shafts through through various various ways with some yeah people do not even realize that they exist we see it a lot and then this is this added value of a hot smoke test. So that's something we see a lot. But I would still encourage people on construction sites to do the checking before we come and do the test, because that needs to be done. I will just add one more thing for myself. It's basically the best educational tool. Everyone who was tested, I would say his design was checked by Hotmos test, will ignore the power of this tool to be verified and will come to the next design more carefully. Yeah, absolutely. And the same way as we can test someone, we can be tested by someone. And being conscious about this fact just brings the design to a higher, safer level. Including, for example, not ignoring the power of the inflowing air from the inlets. Because they can just ruin totally the entire system. Janusz, you were completely correct with that. Sometimes enough to tell a designer, dude, this will be tested with a hot smoke test and it will fail. You will have smoke everywhere and this will not be commissioned. So you better do it correctly. Obviously, the clients do not pay for the test to educate anyone, but I think it's this sort of extra benefit that you get I mean we have seen it with our team with people working with us here in the company but also you know by the reaction of people the designers who come to witness the tests the fire brigade people because okay many people in the fire brigade especially working in prevention let's face it they not necessarily get to see a fire up close or maybe in a situation which would allow them to appreciate the nuances of the smoke control design. So I think it's an added benefit. Not only you test the system, but many people involved in the process actually get to learn something. And I think that's something that's not the intended aim of the test, but it's an added element of it. And now as a final thing, we've mentioned so many things that go wrong in a building, that can go wrong in a building, especially in the automation. Let's put ourselves in the shoes of an investor. You hire these people to do a hot smoke test in your building and they show you like five days before the building was supposed to be open that it's not working. To what extent the things in the building are fixable? Like to what extent after a hot smoke test, how quickly you can incorporate fixes to solve the most common issues you find in a building? Obviously, if with the hot smoke test, you find that there is no smoke exhaust when it should be, you cannot fix that. But when the errors are inside the matrix or the automation or the computer side of the system, they are fixable. What's your opinion on that? To what extent a building can be fixed after a hot smoke test? Well, it really depends on the situation. As you said yourself, the programming errors are the easiest and quickest to fix. And they are the errors that we frequently see. But it's fair to say that depending on the situation and sometimes also on whether or not the designer had this foresight to actually try and maybe, for example, design with a little bit extra capacity of smoke fans or a little bit more replacement air inlets than theoretically required. If this is the case, if the designer has this instinct or experience to actually maybe sometimes oversize the system a little bit, then you actually have some ways of fixing some problems. For example, what we have seen a lot is that sometimes the overall way in which a smoke control or a smoke extract system works depends highly on the architecture. And sometimes by adding something like a smoke barrier in a certain place, or sometimes even putting a piece of a wall, maybe a few meters long in the right place can actually hugely improve the situation in terms of smoke logging. So these are things that very often can be relatively cheaply and easily done. Obviously, very often you cannot add a completely new inlet. But if, for example, your inlets are just made in the form of something like external gates, then by opening more gates, you can probably improve the situation. Sometimes it's actually the other way around, that you may have an inlet in an incorrect position. And then if you have, again, as I said, this extra area or extra capacity of replacement inlet, then you can probably either cover it or remove it. And then this can also allow you to influence the way in which the system works. Also, what we have found is that sometimes the system is started from the very beginning with the full capacity, where in fact, at the early stages of the fire, it's more appropriate to start maybe just with 50% capacity. So if your design incorporates several smoke fans, you can start them in sequence. Sometimes you have a frequency inverter that you can use to increase the capacity of smoke extract. So there are, if you are lucky, there are ways that you can fix a system which is not working exactly as it should. But of course, it's much easier to fix the problems at design stage and better to do the design at the design stage than to find out in a hot smoke test five days before commissioning of the building. That's obvious. As I've mentioned before, we found that errors or problems, issues in at least 80% of the buildings we have tested. And I guess we've done more than 120 buildings by now at ITB. And I recall only one building in which the issue was critical design flow, and they had to actually build an additional shaft to provide inlet air. But that was the, in my whole career, that was the only building which could not been fixed through a simple means, like you said, adding a smoke barrier, adding a wall, removing a curtain wall, opening or closing an inlet or outlet. Also, things like merging smoke zones sometimes work. Sometimes you have a huge smoke control zone and you have to split it into two separate zones. Sometimes you have multiple sources of air that you can choose from, and maybe the inlet that you thought will be most efficient is not the one that you should use. Maybe you should use adjacent one. So it truly is remarkable how much you can change in a building that's already been built. And having this tool at your hand, like you are there with the smoke machine, you can do the change and test it and check if it works or not. you can do the change and test it and check if it works or not. And for me, outside of that one case, we always found a way out. Like it was never a case that the building could not have been opened or would have been severely delayed because the hot smoke tests were done in it. And in every single case, the building was safer after that. It's like we've never made the building less safe with hot smoke tests. They have always made the building safer. And for me, outside of everything, this is the biggest added value of this method. It adds safety to the building. And I really appreciate us finding that way of doing these tests and being able to actually deliver the safety to the buildings. We can only agree. Yes, as Janusz said, we only agree with that. As you said, after most of these tests, essentially the modifications or the improvements in the programming, sometimes it's even simple things like changing orientation slightly of jet fans, things like that, that really can be done in a matter of maybe a couple of weeks at the construction site. But they do improve the way in which the system works. So, yeah, I think we both agree with Janusz that what you said is very true. And it makes me very happy that we shared this common opinion about the tool, because I think this is what the tool needs to be marketed as. The thing that adds safety to the buildings, not the theatrical representation of smoke or a show for the firefighters so they get lost and they approve the building. I hope the tool is not that. I really hope it is something that adds value to the building. Okay, Piotr, Janusz, thank you so much for coming to the show. I really appreciate that. I hope that Polish method will spread like a virus to the world and will give safety to the buildings and their users. Maybe someone picks up. And if you're interested about this method, I'll drop the contacts to Piotr and Janusz in the show notes so you can flood them with emails they're very nice, Janusz replies immediately so please do so if you have questions how to implement that in your engineering Piotr Janusz, thank you so much for being here thank you very much for invitation thank you very much for inviting us and for the discussion thanks Wojtek it was great, Thank you, guys. Bye. And that's it. I hope you've enjoyed that. Let me summarize on what the Polish hot smart method is for me. The first thing is about creating a large size threat in the building in the form of buoyant thermal plume and a lot of smoke in it. It spreads in the zone of the building that you are testing. And actually, you could call it a global challenge for the building because there's going to be a large part of the building being filled with smoke. And this global approach is so much better than individual testing. Like Pils said in the interview, you have to do the individual testing of all of the components of the system, obviously. But sometimes they just act different when they are together in a system. To the extent that sometimes delays caused by the amount of sensors in the system can just change the outcome completely compared to when you test a sensor after sensor. Truly, we've seen that on some buildings, that there were just too many sensors, the network was overloaded, and it took minutes to process the data. The second thing, it's not necessarily about the exhaust of the smoke control system or the performance of the smoke control system, but yet with this method, you can emphasize some failures of the smoke control system, like excessive inlet velocity, like incorrect placement of smoke curtains, leakages, incorrect performance of dampers, gates, and so on. So these things you can easily spot when doing a hot smoke test, but you cannot really tell after a hot smoke test, yes, this system is appropriate for the building and the challenges the fires in this building will bring, because we don't know the real fire. And the third thing is speed. When you cut down all the hassle with setting up thermocouple trees in the building, when you make the source very simple, something that you can move, something that takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to set up, you suddenly gain ability to run a lot of these tests. And this changes the game completely because suddenly you're able to test the building as a whole. You can spend two or three days having 15, 20 tests in them. And you build up this realistic image about the system in the building. And that is just amazing. I would never trade this speed for ability to have two megawatt fire in a building or ability to measure the smoke layer height with non-visual methods. Never. It's just too powerful to be this quick. And the experiments are very repeatable. We've done that in laboratory. We've burned the trace countless times and we get pretty much the same result in terms of heat release rate or burning time. So the repeatability of the method is really good actually. And the final thing, you can fix almost everything that you witness on the building like literally buildings are fixable smoke control systems are fixable smoke detection systems are fixable you very very rarely run into issues that would prevent opening of a building with a hot smoke test and actually if you do that's probably some life-threatening issues that it's maybe better that you capture that with a hot smoke test. And actually, if you do, that's probably some life-threatening issues that it's maybe better that you capture that with the hot smoke test rather than open the building and just go on with your life. So there's really a little risk that this will introduce delays in your building completion. And as I said in the final conclusion of the interview, we never left the building making it less safe than when we've arrived. It always made it safer. So I hope that you're at least intrigued by this approach. Maybe you would like to try it. If you want to know what equipment is used or how we're actually doing that, maybe you want some photographs of the tests or something, please contact Janusz and Piotr or you can email me and we'll share you with the details because we're very happy to share this approach. And yeah, I guess that's it for the episode. I hope you stick with me for the rest of the year. My episodes will be coming as usual on Wednesdays. We are going onwards to the milestone of 25,000 listens of the podcast, which I would love to achieve before one year anniversary. That's in June. At this moment, we just broke 15,000, so that's very good, and it makes me very happy to have this big of an audience, this awesome audience that you are, and I hope you stick here with me. If you want to help me break the record, you can either listen to every episode three times or you can invite some friends to listen to the podcast and whichever you pick it's on you if you can share with someone please do so and that's it for today thank you for being here with me and see you next Wednesday. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
