 Welcome to the Fire Science Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello and welcome to Fire Science Show Session 32. I'm not really sure how to call it. Is it a season finale, a Christmas special? I'm not sure if such big names fit the episode, but it certainly is the last episode this year. And as such, it's a great moment to go back in time and remember some of the best moments in the podcast, what has happened and what has been achieved in here, and share some fondest memories of this year in making with you. I hope you'll join me in this time travel. I'm kind of relieved that this year is finally ending. And as usual, the Christmas time or the last six weeks before Christmas are usually madness for us in the office with all the projects that must be delivered before Christmas for some reason, which I don't understand. All this scientific work that has to be accomplished. And in this year, a special bonus, we're going through a five-year period scientific evaluation as an institute. And I'm leading some of the tasks in that process. scientific evaluation as an institute and i'm leading some of the tasks in that process so even more work than usually not to mention the crew being plugged by covet and being quarantined and ill all the time ah what a great year it was what a difficult year it was and i'm really happy that in such difficult circumstances in such a crazy, my number one goal of the year was reached, which was obviously to start a podcast. And here we are, 32 episodes later. First, please let me thank you all for listening to the Fire Science Show. I see the stats. I see there's an audience that's religiously listening to every episode. I appreciate you doing that so much, and I hope this podcast meets your expectations. I see new people come in and go and come back all the time. I hope you find interesting topics in here and you find what are you looking for in here. And if you're here for entertainment, I hope I don't fail in delivering that either. And I think the most I would like to thank all the guests that have been here in the show with me for first believing in this project. I know it's not easy to come into a radio show and start talking about your work. It's especially difficult to explain scientific concepts when there is no visuals around. And this challenge is something that I had to jump over. And I admit it was not easy. So once again, thank you all for sharing your knowledge with the audience of the podcast and helping us go through this journey. In today's episode, I wanted to summarize some of the most interesting topics that were covered in the show over the last months. And I've made a list and I'll go through it shortly. But first, I would like to reflect on the growth of the podcast. So we have started on June the 2nd, a half year ago. And what a start that was. We've started with three episodes with an introduction and an episode on smoldering megafires with Professor Guillermo Reyn. And the topic of visibility in smoke and sustainability criteria with Gabriel Avina. And I didn't really expect much from that start because I absolutely had no idea what is going to happen. And I was so surprised that people actually listened to it. People actually enjoyed it, commented, shared. The stats were going crazy for the first week. We got like 1,000 listens in the first two weeks and we've reached a 2K milestone in the first month. And truly, this felt like a remarkable achievement for myself and this show. I felt that maybe I've hit a niche and maybe this is something that will interest you. And what you did, you've stayed here with me and you were coming back to the show every Wednesday for new episodes. And quite soon at the end of the summer, I've reached another milestone of 5,000 listens. Then six weeks later, it was 10K. And now in this week, it seems that we are going to pass another large mark, which is 15,000 listens. 15,000 listens in the first half year of the show. It is amazing. And I'm really thankful for your time spent in this show. I hope it is well spent time. The popularity of the show was highly related to the popularity of particular episodes. And I admit there were some episodes that stood out from all the others. You can call them the hot topics. From my very first episodes, the most popular was clearly the one with Professor Gerberain, where he told me about his year's EconSolidator grant about peat megafires, this type of smoldering combustion that's ongoing in natural peatlands in Southeast Asia and Siberia. And the carbon footprint of this, even this insane, it's something that you can truly call a global skill or a mega challenge that we're facing and for me i mean it's not directly related to fire engineering but wow that was eye-opening on what impact fire ecology can have on the planet and how important our field can become so i really enjoyed this episode and i was really really really happy that Guillermo took the invite to be my first interviewee. And since then, he truly believed in the show. He came back with a talk on traveling fires, which was also quite interesting. The most listened episode in its first days was certainly the episode on battery fires with Roland Bishop, days was certainly the episode on battery fires with Roland Bishop, where we went into how batteries are tested, what happens when a car or vehicle with battery burns down, how does it look like, how does it feel like? And it was such an amazing episode. And I must admit, I was so happy this episode made this peak of popularity because I didn't really plan that episode. I wanted to cover this topic myself, which I actually did one week later. But I felt that I'm not competent enough to talk about the testing of batteries or the fire behavior of batteries. So I figured out, okay, there's Roland. He's known for being a really smart guy in this area. So I quickly poked him, maybe you can have find like 15 minutes of your time, answer me two questions. So I can put them in into an episode with me. And we would post it like a mini episode or something. And he found time like two days later, and we've started talking and then one hour has passed. And it was purely amazing. I've learned so much about battery fires from Roland, probably more in this one hour of talking than over months of reading papers and studying that subject. I would not say it was accidental. I kind of planned that, but I didn't plan it to be a full episode. And Roland was such an amazing guest. It turned into a full episode and it turned into a really popular episode, the most popular of the first 10 episodes. From the second 10th of the show, an episode that stood out was clearly the engineered timber with Danny Hopkins. Another hot topic you can say. You learn about timber being stronger than fire, timber chars not burns, and stuff like that all around. And with Danny, we grew more and more tired of that, and there's not really much we can do about it because it's non-fire professionals who are spreading this misinformation or fake science, maybe even. And we decided that, okay, the best way would be probably to record a podcast episode and try to educate people. And here is a fragment of this show that summarizes the concepts quite well and captures the essence of this episode. So please let me pass the voice to Danny. I would start by saying we started building buildings that we couldn't necessarily evidence the performance of with Mass Timber. We kind of ran before we could walk. Some of the things that exist, very cellularized CLT apartment buildings with lots of exposed surface area are kind of the perfect storm for a fire that's not necessarily going to extinguish it before your structure potentially fails. So the first challenge, I guess, is in understanding the remit of the common codes and standards that we apply in design and i think a real challenge is a competency of the people designing buildings so we have codes and standards that in their origin have come from non-combustible buildings they were designed to deliver an adequate level of safety for concrete enclosures, for steel frames, for brickwork, for other forms of masonry. And so a lot of concepts we have in building design, things like fire resistance, as you mentioned, are premised on the structure not becoming involved as a source of fuel. The very early mass timber buildings, particularly in the UK, kind of assumed that those rules and guidance that apply for structures that don't burn can simply be extrapolated to structures where they're contributing as a source of fuel. And we know that's absolutely not true. And there's been some great papers that have been written on it. You've got the We Need to Talk About Timber lecture by Angus law and the corresponding paper in the structural engineer so the first challenge has been in educating people in in understanding when they're applying a code or a standard what they're getting and where the scope of that ultimately run runs its course and where timber fits into that discussion and that's not been as easy a challenge to address as you might think and i think that's for a couple of reasons structure or fire engineers to start with to my mind at least not actually that proficient at dealing with combustion problems so a lot of fire engineering consultants at least kind of operate in this little bubble of i think angus law and graham spinardi defined it as sort of code speak you develop an expertise being able to read back what codes and standards are telling you to do so there was almost like a memorizing an interpretation of a series of rules and regurgitating those back to design teams which doesn't help you design mass timber buildings you have to understand biodynamics quite well and you have to have definitely a good understanding of the combustion processes and wow that one hit the target with something like 600 downloads within the first week it was amazing the biggest episode start till now and it will shed wildly it reached people out of fire science and i hope it did a lot of good and for me it's a really proud moment when you see these discussions linked in about the flammability of wood and in the comments someone pops oh here's the podcast episode you should listen to and it's that episode and it makes me so proud and happy. And for the final episodes or the most recent episodes, Big Hitter was the one with Brian Mitchum and it was amazing to discuss the state of performance-based fire engineering with Brian. Absolutely amazing episode and one of the best and the most powerful conversations I had in my life. But I will come back to that soon. So if you go to my podcast website, firescienceshow.com, you will find I've created this thing called the topical collections in the podcast where I've tried to group the episodes into thematical groups. So maybe it's easier for someone to discover the show or find episodes that are more closely tied together to form some sort of a theme. And with these themes, I really found the richness of fire science and how wide this field is. I knew it's going to be wide and wild. And I said that in the very first episodes that I've expected it to be very wide, but oh my, I didn't expect it to be this wide, this diverse, this complicated. It's unbelievable. The field of science we are in is just incomprehensible, really. But it's beautiful because of that. It's fascinating because of that. It's something you can study your whole life and still learn new things. I'm studying this my entire professional career, which may not be that long, but I still learn new things. And people like Brad Mitchum, who are here for like three decades, they also learn new things almost all the time, which makes this field beautiful. The first group you'll find there is something i've called the fascinating world of fire science and it covers all the different topics from the ends of the fire science which i found fascinating which i found the most interesting which i found as the topics that can simply wow youics you could possibly share with a friend who's not a fire expert, and they could possibly still enjoy them. And if you are a fire expert or if you're working in this field, it's topics that will certainly interest you. And they spam from engineering to fundamental fire science. to fundamental fire science. And I made this collection especially for people who are maybe not that deep into the engineering aspects of the fire world, maybe not that into the industrial aspects, but they just feel like they would like to learn more about fire phenomena themselves and just find more knowledge about what the fire is how it behaves how it spreads how it grows how it quenches these are the things that you can find it here where plus some interesting materials on how some of the things we are using today were founded and this was one of the major goals of the podcast that i've mentioned in the introduction episode to seek the origins of some of the most common assumptions and magic numbers in the world of fire science and i've been hunting them i've been able to hunt two or three of them and they're all in these various episodes within this topical group so if you're looking for entertainment and just to learn more about fires, the group of episodes under the fascinating world of fire science is definitely for you. So from the topics that I found most interesting to myself, certainly a theme of the podcast was related to the tools of fire safety engineering, and I've called it the engineer's toolbox. And in this theme, we've covered the models, the toolbox of fire safety engineer. And one particular tool that emerged as something really interesting to myself and very popular among the audience, based on your your feedback was the use of artificial intelligence and i've heard many of you heard for the first time about how this can be practically implemented in fire safety engineering something that looks like to be a future of discipline and something that looks like a very very promising direction and i i'm certainly learning that and trying it a bit and i would recommend that to you as well and to help me tell you why it is interesting and important to learn i've picked this short fragment of the interview with sinan huang from the h Kong Polytechnic University. That was the episode 7 of the podcast, which, as all of them, I highly recommend. But let's hear what Xinyuan had to say about the AI. So from a scientific point of view, from a fire scientist's point of view, sometimes you feel frustrated, like you know all the equations, but AI know nothing can do better. Maybe in future, some high school student who are familiar with these AI tools, they can predict the fire better than you, although they know nothing about equations. But if we're thinking about the CFDs, then I think it's understandable for most people using CFD to simulate fires. Many of them do not know the fundamental fire dynamics or the equations behind it. And they are still using it very almost daily for their job, for the design. Of course are still using it very, almost daily, for their job, for the design. Of course, some of the results, simulation results, are quite questionable. So still, I would suggest them to learn the file science dynamics behind, so they can use the tool better and wiser. I think that will apply to AI as well. Eventually, I guess there will be very cool or powerful AI tools to help you do the fire engineering design or in general any kind of design. But sometimes these predictions could be non-realistic in terms of fire protection. If something happens, it could be catastrophic. So my suggestion is still. So enjoy the new tool, but still learn the fundamentals. Yep, amen. Enjoy the new tool, but still learn the fundamentals. That's something I must approve. And going forward with the topic of AI, I have invited Emzin Sir, who is a rising star in the field of machine learning and AI in fire science, who gave me a very easy introduction to the world of AI, and I guess that's also an episode to check out. And last but not least, I had a special guest, Dr. Matthew Bonner from Imperial College London. That was actually episode four, where we've discussed the use of AI going through a facade flammability database and how was that implemented in it. Besides the tools related to AI, we've covered plenty more in the podcast, including two episodes on CFD with Paul from Yarn and zone modeling with Colleen Wade. Zone modeling is not dead episode, which is one of my favorites in the show. And this shows you how to play with fire modeling tools and the traps waiting for you when you want to use these tools. We've also covered quite a lot about structure fire engineering. Maybe not directly, like how to calculate loads and how to figure out when the structure will collapse, but we've covered quite a lot of important topics around structural fire engineering, including resilient design, the use of traveling fires in the design of buildings, and as mentioned before, timber, and timber was here actually twice, not only with Danny Hopkins, where we've covered the basics in the introduction, but also an episode with Felix Weissner, where we have ventured quite deep into the role of adhesives in the performance of timber and what makes an engineered timber an engineered timber. How does one engineer timber, actually? That was really, really interesting to me. And the last group of tools that I was covering here was related to evacuation. And I think this requires their own category. I've really got the top people working in the field of evacuation science to give me the interviews. And we have covered so much about modeling movement and human behavior. And I'm not sure if I've succeeded, but my goal was to draw this line, which is very blurred every day, to draw a line between modeling movement and modeling behavior. Because from my point of view, modeling movement is fairly easy. But modeling behavior, wow, that is a completely different pair of shoes. This is something completely different. And it opens a completely new world of opportunities. And why does it matter? Well, I'll give the voice to Erika Kuligowski, who started episode 19, which was on wildfire evacuation. But not only that, it was quite much more than just wildfire evacuation. So, yeah, Erika explained it the best. We hear a bunch of people in a room, and we're just going to give them all a different pre-evacuation time in our simulation model and see what happens. But we know that people in the same room are definitely in the same space, are influenced by what people are doing around them. So it's very artificial to be thinking about pre-evacuation delay time in that way. If we see someone and they're packing up their belongings and they're taking whatever's going on seriously. And especially if we feel like they're a credible source to us, oh, I know them. They're my colleague. I talk to them every day and they think this is serious. Then people are more likely to start preparing themselves and to evacuate. In my dissertation in the World Trade Center, it was really these early actors that played quite a role. And not only did they start preparing and getting themselves ready for safety in the World Trade Center, they also told other people to evacuate and they started assisting other people. And that played quite a big role. And these early actors were people who had fire experience, who were fire wardens, people in management positions. So these people were stepping up and they were used to stepping up, even people with military training. So that played quite a big role. And I would say the same is true for large scale disasters. If people see their neighbors taking preparation, they might go over there and ask, hey, what are you doing? What's going on? And that's kind of that milling that goes on, right? That plays quite a role in our decision-making. And people need confirmation of the threat also. And so when they receive a message, but then they see their neighbor preparing, that's confirming, right? Someone else is taking this seriously. Maybe I should take it seriously as well. I hope from this snippet and from the whole episode, you can feel the difference between what it means to just pop a pre-evacuation time distribution and just make your agents move and what it means to truly model the evacuation of people and why we model this or what goes through the heads of people in the evacuation that's something that mckinsey explained to me in episode 10 where we've covered the biases and some of the decision-making processes and wow that was a great episode as well i i was coming back to that one many times, reflecting on it in my discussions with other guests of the show. Finally, I had Professor Ronchi and Professor Lovreglio in my show, two Italians, a span all over the world. We had a crazy session discussing the future of fire safety engineering in terms of evacuation modeling and evacuation in general. terms of evacuation modeling and evacuation in general. And it's full of great concepts, among them the use of smartness in the building, of sensors to drive the evacuation. And that was something that really caught my attention. So let's hear what Enrico Ronchi had to say about the future of evacuation in buildings. One aspect is something that unfortunately, in most cases, safety is still seen as a box that we need to tick. Compliance, not safety. Exactly. So in an ideal world, safety would be, for instance, if you go to a hotel, safety would be as much rated as comfort or other things that will make you choose one over another. But unfortunately, the reality is that very often this is not the case. one over another. But unfortunately, the reality is that very often this is not the case. So you need to meet the minimum bar. Then if you are exceeding that minimum, let's say very little people care. And often the clients don't want to even pay for exceeding that minimum. Not in all the cases, but in most of the cases. What I will see as an ideal, let's say an ideal setup to really exploit what we have nowadays will be something like that connects these sensors with a modeling system so even smarter in a way so and there are a few attempts of research groups that have tried to do that i know that the group in greenwich has started so basically you you have building that is rigged with sensors this information is sent to a simulator the simulator also knows where the people currently are, knows where the threat is, and then run a set of what-if scenarios and analyze what is the best route to indicate to people to get the quickest and the safest evacuation. I mean, it sounds like sci-fi nowadays, but we're actually not that far from getting there. I mean, there are a few things to solve concerning, let's say, reliability of such systems and, you know, legislation, things have to hold during a fire, everything, the communication. And this you can go a full loop back to the episode we've seen in Huang, where he was using sensors to detect fires and predict the fire growth and behavior. And it looks like the technology is almost there or is there. We just have to find a way how to use it and find a way how to convince the building owners and administrators that they want this technology to actually be used in their building. In the third group, the fire science and engineering, I've gathered all the episodes which have practical knowledge about fire science and engineering. It actually overlaps a lot with the first group, but it's more engineering focused probably and still has a lot of science. And I had so many great guests in talking about their projects, I had so many great guests in talking about their projects, how they've implemented fire science and engineering in their research and engineering. I've hosted Professor Rain twice. Once he was talking about smoldering megafires, and it was fascinating. And once about traveling fires. I had two episodes about visibility in smoke. One with Gabriel Lavinia, one with Professor Lucas Arnold, which were very, very close to my heart. I had some great, great scientists in my show. I had Kathleen Stoof, who was explaining to me why she pursued the Marius Kuduski Reaction Grand Pyrolife to create a whole generation of PhDs in fire ecology. And that was great, and the program is growing so well. I hope you're following on that. I had Professor Mike Colner, who was talking about the role of fluid dynamics in fires, and it was also a great talk on what makes fire burn. And I had this great episode with Sarah McAllister. Wow, I'm biased. It's one of my favorites from the whole year of the podcast. It was such a fantastic discussion with Sarah about what makes things burn. I mean, I wanted it to be, you know, like really easygoing episode without much fire science. Just chat a bit about the things that make fires grow and burn. I've asked a cheesy question about the match. And oh boy, the first answer was already a strong hit. And the episode keeps on giving and keeps on giving this really interesting science facts. But yeah, you should. I guess I should pass the stage to Sarah so you can listen to what she had to say about the simplest form of fire I imagined, and trust me the rest of the episode is even better. Let's start with the smallest scales. Let's think about a match fire or a candle flame. What would you say are the phenomena that the simplest phenomena that would drive these fires well i think that also depends on which way you're holding the match right okay yes holding the match where the you know it's burning from the top down you're going to get a very different process than if you're holding the match upside down and trying to not burn your fingertips or even holding it sideways so that the flame propagates kind of horizontally across it, right? And so there, much like a candle, there's a lot of processes going on, right? You need to transfer heat to unburned fuel to pyrolyze the fuel. That fuel then has to mix with air and ignite, you know, the typical process. But, you know, how that heat is transferred ignite, you know, the typical process. But, you know, how that heat is transferred really depends on the direction that that flame is propagating, right? So if it's downward, you can't, the umber fuel can't necessarily, air quotes on, see the flame, right? Radiation isn't going to be very important for downward spread. You're talking much more about, you know, conducting some of that heat through the solid. You're also doing some gas phase conduction or convection. You're kind of probably splitting hairs at that point, right? Because it often isn't zero, but it's pretty minimal. So is it conduction or is it convection in the gas phase? But, you know, if you hold that match upside down and yet flame is propagating upwards, you have a lot more opportunity for radiant heat from that flame to heat up the unburned fuel to spread that fire. But you still have, you know, conduction to the solid phase and you still have some convective heating. So as that match gets bigger and bigger or as those flames get bigger and bigger, that matchstick gets bigger and bigger or as those flames get bigger and bigger that the balance between what is driven by convection versus radiation is going to change right and that's that complex problem of scaling and the last group building a fire safe future this one is so good i knew that the podcast will enable me to talk about fire science, fundamentals of fire, engineering tools, CFD and stuff like that. But I was not expecting that I will find myself in the middle of really fundamental discussions on what fire safety engineering is. Who is a fire engineer? What is the fire engineer doing? What is their place in the world of engineering? What challenges are there in front of them? It just has been amazing to have this discussion with the industry leaders. And what is most interesting, I received answers I was not really expecting. That maybe we are not doing the things that we should be doing, that there may be other ideas, that there might be some fundamental issues that prevent us delivering the safety we intend to provide to the society. And these discussions were just eye-opening. And I guess one day I should write a book about what I've learned in this part of the podcast, because it was truly an amazing journey. It started with Keith Balfe, the president of SFP Europe. And in this discussion, we've talked about the triangle, the science industry and legislators on how to make them work together. And it was an hour long discussion. I remember recording this podcast. I was in my car. It was in the middle of a storm. Somehow the audio quality is not that horrible in that episode. If it is, I truly apologize for that. There was like police chasing a guy around me. I thought they were coming for me because I look suspicious with a laptop and a headset inside the vehicle inside of a storm. But thankfully they just chased another guy. But yeah, they just chased another guy. But yeah, regardless of the circumstances, I had such a good discussion with Kisbo and I know it was a starting point for many more discussions that I saw on LinkedIn. And from this talk, I've picked one of the last things he said, but I think it summarizes the concept of this episode quite well. And it's a story about the tunnel engineering, but the conclusion is just so powerful. So keep your ears open until the end of what Keith has to say. Coming back to where we started off, I think in the beginning, the reason why I chose fire safety, because the Golden Gate Bridge was not to be rebuilt in the southwest of the Netherlands, but it was supposed to be a tunnel. Later on, I did a lot of work also on on the fire safety of the tunnel the best of the tunnel and there was quite some debate about who should be in control of the fire safety measurements and and design should that be the tunnel operator who was trained on the job to push the buttons or should it be the fire brigade officer who really understands how fires could could develop or should it be both or should it be neither and should it just be the system that automatically kicks in the ventilators or or the sprinkler system or or the the barriers and and the traffic lights and so forth or open up or or close the escape doors from the connecting tunnels. And those are discussions that we are still having. And who should be in control? And sometimes it's just a matter of bringing the people together and say, okay, guys, together we will have a protocol. And maybe in every uh it potentially could be different because it just depends on on where for example the fire brigade is stationed are they close by or are they far off does traffic control uh actually sit literally physically on top of the tunnel or is it somewhere in in a center remote from from this tunnel? You could argue who has the best papers to go into the tunnel and actually see, observe, and marvel what's going on, appreciating that the tunnel was designed to cope with some scenario or other, but the situation at hand is slightly different, so you have to tweak what is happening. You can't rely on a fully automated system. what is happening. You can't rely on a fully automated system. Those are discussions where if you put people in the room who are inclined to listen to each other, listen to the arguments rather than hide behind a certificate or a protocol or this is how we've always done it in the past or this is what worked in this situation, but are open to listen to others. in this situation but are open to listen to others. That's where the gold can be found. If you have eyes and ears predominantly opened towards the other rather than ventilate your own opinion, that's the recipe for gold. Yep, being open for discussion. That is a key point in here. And the second point that pubs are very important for fire science, but not everyone agrees with that. However, I agree with that fully. Keith was not the only guest that I had the privilege to talk about the role of fire engineering. Shortly later, I've hosted Benjamin Ralph, who is the head of fire science at Fosters Plus Partners, and he's a fire engineer in Mega Architect Bureau or Star Architect Bureau. And he showed me plus partners and he's a fire engineer in a mega architect bureau or star architect bureau and he showed me completely opposite side of fire safety engineering what does an architectural company expects from fire safety engineers and there were things like rapid prototyping mentioned in there which really blew my mind and i admit in that episode I've praised standards and codes, which I usually don't do. But Ben has convinced me that there is a point in that. And for this point itself, it's probably worth a listen. I was also blessed with having Jimmy Johnson. I told you to vote on him for SFP presidency. And guess what? He won it. Congratulations, Jimmy. I'm so proud that you will be an European representative in the headquarters of SFP as the new SFP president. It truly makes me so, so happy. But that's not the only thing about your episode. With Jimmy, we had such a great talk about who is a fire safety engineer and what should a fire safety engineer know and what should they do. And where the competencies start when they need to ramp up. It was just a fascinating journey. Jimmy has participated in writing the core competencies guideline of SFPE, and he goes in details through that document in the show. But one thing that really, really caught my attention, and I kind of drive him to that conclusion, if I'm honest. But it echoes what Keith said about the ability to discuss fire safety engineering. And yeah, please listen to what Jimmy had to say about soft skills of a fire engineer. Sometimes this is a hell of a challenge, you know, to explain a fire safety strategy to all of the participants, and especially the guy with the bag of money who pays for the building. And as Benjamin Ralph said, they're definitely non-certified. You don't have to have a license to have a lot of money and build buildings, which maybe should be the first thing to license. to license. And the second thing is you have to communicate with people who not always want to listen to you. With firefighters, local authorities. Sometimes it's not only communication. Sometimes you truly have to do proactive teaching to them. What do you think about these soft skills? Maybe you see another important soft skill that is critical. No no the key is communication skills is what you said because you're forced to communicate same problem or the same solution to such a wide range of different people that someone has as you said no skill no technical skill at all they're handling a permitting, a license, or a money issue. They're buying the components, something. And to the far, far end, to another engineer, maybe the third-party reviewer of the project, which is a fine engineer, and then to the authorities that might know a lot or might not know a lot, that would have to approve this whole thing. So I think that's a key skill that is necessary. You need to be able to communicate really well. You convey the idea and the solution so everyone understands it. And I really like one thing that you said there. Well, you don't need to have any license if you have a lot of money to do whatever you want with that money. If there's someone keen to invest in this and you convince them, for example, that this is acceptable and it will work, you better be sure that that will work then later on. A lot of pre-work is needed, especially with authorities. Before you actually start any project, make sure that it will be to some degree acceptable, that you have a path that is planned, that you can actually convince them, and that they are open to these ideas, because that is all what performance-based design is about. You're not complying with the rules. You're deviating from the rules. So unless that is conveyed in a straight manner and a serious and open way, the project will not go forward. So I think communication is the number one skill, as you said. And I could just finish the episode on this. The communication is the number one skill you have to have in fire science and engineering. And I hope this podcast arms you up for being a better science communicator in your environment. Finally, the episode of the year, I guess. Really, the most powerful discussion I ever had with another fire engineer. It was with Brian Meacham, and it was not an easy talk. I thought it's going to go completely different. But he was straight up front with me that what are we doing may not be working. What are we doing may not necessarily be the best way to implement fire safety. That you simply cannot implement fire safety as an island within the sea of the design of the building. It's not in a sphere separated from everything else. It is encompassing everything else in the design. And if we don't stop thinking about fire, safety engineering as a niche, we're not going to succeed. We can get more sophisticated models. We can get more sophisticated tools. But we sometimes just lack purpose of doing the engineering analysis. We lack goals. We don't set them. We don't discuss them. We don't outline them. And with that, sometimes we do a lot of work, which is pointless. And in this part of the episode, I think Brian has summarized it in just a brilliant way. So here we go, Brian. One of the things that was always a concern for me and one thing that I tried to incorporate when I was teaching about performance-based design is getting the problem definition correct. Because over my career, I've seen a lot of people invest a lot of time in solving the wrong problem. And then at the end of the day, you have all this nice analysis that says all kinds of wonderful things, but somehow the point has been missed. And I think that's the root of the challenge here, is that I don't think we've well enough to define what performance we're trying to achieve. And you can look at this in different ways. If we go back maybe a little bit to the structural engineering analogy, we go back maybe a little bit to the structural engineering analogy, it's trying to prevent unacceptable failure of the building given load combinations that are imposed on it. In fire safety, we have a lot of objectives. We have basically the five fire safety goals of protecting people, property, business operation, environment, and heritage. And each one of those has a different aspect. But this focus on people gets us into writing design objectives like provide adequate time for everybody in a building to escape without being subjected to untenable conditions. So now we've taken the design objective away from designing a building that's going to perform at a certain level when subjected to a fire to trying to protect people who are highly variable in their physiology and behavioral responses. And we're expected to be able to say that people will be able to get out without walking through a smoke-filled corridor. We can't control people. You know, we take certain with the building and its systems, given our understanding of human interactions, social constructs, and the regulatory environment, and shift the objective. Then you can figure out the performance that you're actually trying to achieve and pick an appropriate method, which can still range from expert judgment to complex analysis. But when you do it in the context of the institutions that are involved in the regulation and operation and occupancy of a building, then you're sitting in a little better position. So this taking better account of this social technical systems interaction where you're really looking at the actors, the institutions and the technology together. And you're looking at how you can design the building to enable the objective, which may be don't collapse the building. Same as you would do in earthquake engineering, which has the benefit of keeping people safe. do in earthquake engineering, which has the benefit of keeping people safe. And maybe that's a way to start moving beyond some of the roadblocks that we've seen with acceptability, with people who don't necessarily have confidence in our engineering analyses and the assumptions we make. And this was purely amazing, like really, really amazing. And to complement Brian's talk, I've also invited Jaime Cadena and David Lange to talk about maximum damage methodology, because it gave a practical view on what Brian was saying in many points. And I guess that one is also worth a listen after you listen to the episode with Brian Mitchum. And outside of these episodes that I've just mentioned, I also had some great episodes towards the end of the year, one with Anja Boehnhaus-Hoffmann about the flammability of buses and the small difference between the train industry and the automotive industry that makes a huge difference in how they behave. And just a week ago, I had a fantastic talk with Johnny Jensen from VAD Firekill, who was explaining to me how you can extinguish fires in tunnels with water mist and what it means to make a huge project overseas with all the requirements related to that project. For me, as a practical fire safety engineer, it was truly remarkable. And so that's it. So there you have it, a year of the podcast. So many great guests. So many fascinating episodes. I have learned so much from doing this. It's beyond my expectations. It's unbelievable how much great fire knowledge was shared here. If you're listening to the show weekly, what can I tell you more? You've already seemed to be enjoying it a lot. So maybe I don't need to advertise it more to you. I'm just very thankful that you are here with me in this journey. And if you just started listening or came back to the show, you're probably in quite a great position because there should be quite a lot of episodes waiting there for you that you can catch up and these things do not get old these things are as relevant as the day one when i have published them so yeah i hope you will enjoy them now before i end i wanted to open with some plans for the new year um obviously i'm going to continue the podcast if you wondered if this is the end no it's it's not. It's just a Christmas break. I really need some time off. I'm very tired. My family is very tired of this year, and I just need some relaxations, video games, play with my kids, go into the snow, build a snowman. I don't know. Maybe burn something down. We'll see. But obviously, the podcast is going to be in my mind all the time. It's not something that I can get rid of from my head. So I'll be thinking about how to make it a better experience for you in the new year. I will probably seek some help in the early next year for volunteers who could help me a bit with this show. And I'm going to need someone to help me with the copywriting and social media. There is a newsletter that I have over 100 people signed into and I have not sent an email in like months, which I apologize all the newsletter subscribers very much. And this is very, very high on my list to get restarted in the next year. So I will work on some quality of life improvements in the podcast. I have some ideas that are maybe a little bigger. I'm thinking about starting a mini series or maybe a separate series with discussions with legends of fire safety engineering or fire science. It's an idea that was thrown on me by Mike Goldner when we were recording our episode. And I think it's a brilliant idea to talk with the people who were doing fire engineering in the 80s, 90s, who saw the fire engineering before CFD, who were there when the magical numbers were invented, who have had the biggest footprint on what are we doing today, to just talk with them about what made them pursue this career, what went great, what have disappointed them, where we could have done better. Is the future as good as they've expected it to be? Or maybe it's much worse than they've expected it to be. And these are the questions that I would like to ask them. to be and these are the questions that I would like to ask them and it seems that it could be a quite an interesting spin-off the podcast however I need to find some partners for that in terms of hopefully institutional support maybe I'll reach to some bigger institutions in the field to help me finance this and help me reach the guests that would make this mini show be worth the time and be valuable to the whole community so this i'm actually sharing this thought for the first time so i have not reached anyone yet i think it's an interesting idea and mike did an inception on me and it's just something i cannot get rid from my head. Hopefully, maybe I will pursue that next year. Also, I'm going to work a bit with a graphics designer who did the Fire Science Show logo. I hope you like the logo. He's a brilliant graphical designer and maybe will come up with some additional graphics and then put them on T-shirts, hats, and some other apparel. Put them on t-shirts, hats, and some other apparel. So you can show your 5 Centsure's Wagon conferences once they're back to being live. I guess that could be fun. But that's something that's going to probably happen towards the middle of the next year. But something that I would work for. Maybe for the one-year anniversary of the podcast. I could provide you with some merch. That would probably be cool. And yeah, I've reached the end of my list of things that I wanted to share in this episode that summarized the first year of the podcast, the first 31 or 32 episodes of the podcast. Once again, I'm very, very thankful for you being here, for you supporting me, for sharing the episodes with your friends, colleagues in your offices, through your social channels. It was an immense help that helped me spread the word about the podcast. And I truly see it. I see it when some of you post about the podcast on LinkedIn and the next day I see spike in downloads and I see new people coming to the podcast, new viewers who seem to stay with the show for longer because then I see how they start picking up the older episodes. So it's a way to grow the podcast, the best way to grow the podcast. It's through your recommendation. There truly is no other way. The success of this show is probably more in your hands than in mine i'm doing my best i'm trying my best not sure if there are severe improvements on my side probably there are but i would rather think there are not but yeah you can do a lot to help me grow this build this and the bigger it is the bigger it is, the better tools I receive, the better reach I have, the better guests I can coach. It's better for everyone. So thank you very much for being an active member of the community and helping me build this together. And yeah, that's it. I'm going for my well-earned Christmas break. If you celebrate Christmas, have a great Christmas time with your family, and I hope you enjoy this time of the year as much as I do. If you do not celebrate Christmas, I hope you have at least some nice, calm end of the year period. I guess it's calmer all over the world, not only in my side of Europe. I wish you all the best for the new year. We will be back here in the second week of January, so expect a new episode on the 12th of January, and that's where the new season will start. That's when episode 33 will end and yeah not next Wednesday not the next next Wednesday but in three weeks January 12th we see each other in your favorite podcast app or through my website take care all the best cheers This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
