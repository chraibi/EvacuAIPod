 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. In this week, Fire Science Show is back to the subject of mass timber in fire. And it's not just an ordinary interview. In this week, I'm interviewing Dr. Carmen Gusca from OFAR Consultants. Carmen has just recently won the Philip Thomas Award for the best paper of the previous IFSS Symposium. And to give the full credit, the paper is also co-authored by Juan Hidalgo and José Torero. And to give the full credit, the paper is also co-authored by Juan Hidalgo and José Torero. Anyway, this is a huge award. It actually comes with a physical medal that was created in ancient Greece in times of Socrates. Amazing, I've seen it with my own eyes. It's really cool. But it's not the medal that we want to celebrate. It's the research and science and knowledge that she has built up and explained in her research paper. In this episode, we will talk primarily about fire dynamics in timber compartments, because that's the subject of her PhD, of her work. And by fire dynamics, we mean how the physics of fire itself is changed by the presence of exposed timber in a compartment. is changed by the presence of exposed timber in a compartment. So many engineers would focus on stuff like charring rates or critical heat flux conditions that help you get self-extinction of some sort. Okay, that is important. What was found in this work, and I expect that's one of the reasons why it is award-winning work, is that she has clearly identified different mechanisms within the compartment fire and not just identified, she put them against well-established opening factor methodology that exists for years and is a cornerstone of many of the fire safety considerations, proposed a sound explanation of what she saw, and give some really good practical advice to engineers that have to work with timber, mass timber, and fire safety. So I hope I don't need to advertise this anymore. This is a very insightful and inspiring talk by a young scientist, by a woman in fire, who has just won one of the biggest awards in the entire fire discipline.

I'm here today with Dr. Carmen Gurska. Hello, Carmen. Hello. Thank you for inviting me to your podcast. Very happy to have you here. I've invited you as the new recipient of Philip Thomas Award for the best paper at the previous IFSS symposium. PhyDynamics is in mass timber compartments, a paper that I know very well. And it made me very happy to see this work being awarded as the best paper of the previous symposium. So today we're going to talk about timber and your experiences in experimental investigation of fire dynamics in timber compartments. Perhaps we can start with why this edge on timber? You know, everyone is looking into charring, lamination, stuff like that. You started battling with fire regimes and other very difficult aspects of fire dynamics. What brought you into this? Well, to be honest, when I just started with the topic, I had no idea where to start. That's at the beginning of my PhD. And basically, José Torero said, OK, let's just build like a little compartment and let's see what happens. Jose Torero said, okay, let's just build like a little compartment and let's see what happens, you know. So I literally started by actually manufacturing CLT, cross-laminated timber, myself in a very dodgy way, probably. But I remember that very first test already was much bigger than we expected in our lab so we were all like surprised in that very first step of of how big these external flames for example were and we were aware of many other problems like for example that there is this big unknown of connections how still connections are going to perform with the timber but with that very first test it was clear to us that we don't know the very very basics of fire dynamics with the presence of exposed timber inside of a compartment. Okay, fantastic. That's a great word to start. So in a way, it was exploratory to just figure out what's happening around and how you've chosen your compartment size dimensions. What did drive you into the final experiment design that you've used in your PhD? Was it the iterative process? Well, you do experiments yourself. And I guess that you know that sometimes our choices are not based on physical arguments of physics. Sometimes they are more like practical. So there were like two constraints. First was the amount of flow we could take with our hoods like the fire couldn't be bigger than a certain heater is right so that was quite restrictive to to do the the test in the lab and another big thing was that ideally i was i was supposed to be able to do these tests myself because otherwise it would be very hard to do because we wanted to study like this succession of putting more and more and more timber and ideally doing several repeats to to make a proper study and ideally i would be i should have been able to do this myself so the clt walls i was supposed to be able to handle them myself. They were already quite heavy with these dimensions. But yeah, they were like around 25 or 30 kilos, but still possible to handle for one person. But bigger than that, I would have needed help. And that probably instead of four years, it would have taken me six to do this PhD with more than six entire compartments. to do this PhD with more than 60 entire compartments. And then the dimensions of the opening, we just wanted to make sure that we have post-flashover conditions. So, yeah, that's how we chose the opening. I exactly know what you mean about the capacities of the laboratory and the manpower that drives the experimental design. Very similar how in CFD or numerical studies, people usually base on how many processes they have, not the physical constraints of models that they're using. Anyway, let's go into the experiments because you have done a lot of medium scale fire tests with the CLTs. So let's introduce the audience to the concept of the test. How did the experimental setup look like and why did you call it the medium scale test? Well, because we were saying that small scale tests of timber are all these tests, you know, in cone calorimeter and FBA and such. Then there was the material scale, which was TGA scale. And it was not a large scale, like, you know, like where a person can walk in. So eventually, yeah, it ended up being a medium scale, basically, where we can already capture compartment pie dynamics. But it is obviously not a full scale. So we were aware that maybe there are some phenomenons that are restricted by the scale. But it was not like a fruit number scaling that you do a 100 kilowatt fire and you say it's 10 megawatt fire. It was simply just a reduced geometrical size and you allowed physics to go on. Well, we did an attempt of doing a scaling analysis, but yes, as you say, there are so many variables that it is very difficult to keep all the parameters and scale them all down, so we chose a few, which was basically the opening factor and achieve these temperatures that you would usually achieve. But yeah, the opening factor was the main thing that we wanted to keep. Yeah, and when you were talking about this project, I remember you're talking Poland, opening factor was like the first thing you introduced during the talk. And it ties very nicely to the historical research in fire science. So perhaps for those who are not familiar with the concept of opening factor and how we relate the fire dynamics to it, maybe we can try explaining to the audience the concept of opening factor. Yeah, opening factor is a pretty simple parameter that basically relates the amount of heat generation to the heat losses from a compartment. So basically, the more heat generation and the less heat losses you have through the boundaries, the higher would be your temperatures. But eventually, the fire safety science also discovered that it not only can predict fire not constrained by its boundaries, as in a post-splash-over fire. And it basically is driven by different mechanisms, and that affects the temperature distribution, the flows, etc. the temperature distribution, the flows, etc. And we, like the first check was like, how can we apply this framework for timber compartments and how this opening factor is going to apply to timber compartments? So we do, like we usually would refer to those regimes as fuel control, ventilation control. And there's like a very narrow space between the two of them where the fires have the biggest severity. And at the ends of them, at very low opening factors or very large opening factors, the fires tend to be smaller. Let's dig deeper into that because I feel that it's important to the latter discussion. If you have too much fuel, why do temperatures go down in a compartment? Why it's not as, let's say, severe if we measure severity by temperatures? I mean, if you have fuel controlled and your openings are bigger, then basically you have a lot of heat losses through your openings. And it's basically cooling down the compartment, right? Okay. In average, because these are average temperatures always when we talk about that regime and as you start to close your openings you transition to this other regime so basically your temperatures start to build up build up build up and you go to this maximum point on the on the plot okay and eventually you have this change of regime to ventilation control. And it's kind of like an optimum geometry for the compartment to have this optimum relation of heat losses to heat generation. So you have like the good amount of air entering to have a very, it's not stoichiometric mixture, but the closest as it can get to stoichiometry inside. Very efficient. Yeah, efficient combustion and minimalizing your heat losses through the opening and through the boundaries. But then if you keep closing, keep making smaller the opening, then you are basically... The opening starts acting as a valve of oxygen supply. And you keep closing and closing, so there you have less and less oxygen flowing in. And you keep closing, I think, closing, so there you have less and less oxygen flowing in. And therefore, the mixture inside is oxygen deprived and your combustion efficiency decreases and your temperatures go down. If you have closed fully, you kill the fire. That would be like the extreme. Yeah, that makes sense how the ventilation changes. Well, of course, it makes sense. That's the fundamental for fire science that we know. I wonder, is there like a science restriction on this relation? Like, if you have extremely large open-plumb compartment, it's perhaps going to be different because of the spatial distribution of temperature fields, like, not uniform anymore. Yes. How the Thomas and Henselden plot looks like, which has this optimum, right? Yeah. It is important to always remember that for the regime that is fuel controlled, so the one that you mentioned with large open floors and big openings, they have huge scatter of data there. And it is true that fires in that regime are not as easy to predict as to say, okay, the temperature is going to be whatever it's in this correlation, because now we see that the fires in these geometries, they can have like localized effect and be very severe in one side of the compartment, or they can be traveling fires. So the fires, they get much more complex to solve. And usually that's when we need FDS modeling, because simple assumptions of saying the whole compartment has this temperature and is uniform across the compartment, as we do with the other regime, is not valid here. And the big question with timber was because for conventional building, we more or less know when we are going to transition from one regime to the other depending on this geometry and opening right but now that we have this huge amount of additional fuel because our surfaces are exposed timber we didn't know when this transition is going to happen because maybe the same compartment that is non-combustible has a traveling fire, right? But maybe if the ceiling is now exposed timber and it's just ignited almost instantaneously, maybe that actually can induce flashover of the whole compartment. So now, basically, we can have the exactly same geometry, but just because we have additional exposed surfaces of timber, the same geometry can maybe afford for a post-flashover fire. And this is not really well-defined yet. I think now we got into your experiments, because this is, in a way, what you've been researching. You have built these, let's say, box compartments with an opening factor that kind of hits the peak at the Thomas-Hasselden curve, which is the, let's say, optimal combustion rate. Well, it was not at the peak. It was a bit more to the right to ensure that we are in the ventilation control. Okay, okay. So give a bit of margin because, you know, there is always big variability of fire. But more or less in the top region, not on the ends of the scale. And then you start playing with the CLT. So what were you doing exactly with this research? What were your variations of experiments? What outcomes did it lead to? Okay, so in my experiments, yes, I was doing these little boxes, compartment fires, and I was always keeping the geometry the same and the fuel load the same across all the experiments. Well, I did one experimental campaign with wood cribs and one with kerosene, but that's another topic. The geometry was always the same. with kerosene, but that's another topic. The geometry was always the same. And the only thing that I was changing was the amount of exposed timber surfaces inside the compartment. So I was protecting in general the timber with plasterboard. And this is how I did, for example, my baseline tests where tests with all the timber protected. And then I gradually started to expose more and more and more and more timber. And I was having around 100 sensors in these medium scale compartments. And I was measuring a lot of different parameters, heat fluxes to the surfaces inside the compartment, temperature distributions inside the compartment, temperatures at the opening, flows at the openings, inside the compartment, temperatures at the opening, flows at the openings, charring rates. I had a mock-up passage above the opening and I was measuring the heat fluxes to the passage. Anyways, what I observed is that by increasing for the same geometry and by increasing the amount of exposed timber, I would first notice that the temperatures inside the compartment also increased because I'm adding fuel, right? But then I was increasing even more the amount of exposed surface and then the temperature started to decrease. So these lower temperatures, now they were because there was so much excess of pyrolysis gases coming out from the timber that the gas mixture inside the compartment was, this time it was just too fuel-rich, and therefore the combustion was not efficient and the temperatures went down. So in conventional buildings, we would usually encounter situations for large open floors with a mixture that is too oxygen-rich, and the oxygen would go down, and here was like the opposite, right? So if I understand correctly, you had a fixed geometry, fixed opening, so the ratio of opening to the surfaces inside, which is the opening factor, was fixed, always the same. Your fuel load, be it the crib or be it the kerosene, it was every experiment, it was the same. So if you looked on this setup from the perspective of the known fire science opening factors, Thomas Hesselden work, you should usually get the same outcome of this test, right? Because it's dependent on the opening factor, let's say. And you get a scatter with temperatures being higher, with temperatures being lower. a scatter with temperatures being higher, with temperatures being lower. So what does this mean, you know, for a fire engineer who's designing? No, because there were two assumptions for Thomas and Hessel then. And the main one was that the, well, basically that the boundaries were non-combustible and that the fuel was on the floor. And I am not following these assumptions. So I am introducing basically these combustible surfaces. And how this affects the fire is that, first of all, now I have a fuel source which is not only on the floor, but also on a wall and or on the ceiling. And on top of that, the question was like, because usually we assume that we have heat losses through the boundaries, right? And this is part of our energy balance of the compartment. But in this case, if my boundary, a wall, is actually providing heat, can I still assume that I have heat losses through this wall? Probably not. So that's why it basically makes invalid this Thomas and Hesselden framework, because it's not really meeting the main assumptions of this framework, which we knew. And that's why we were checking how we can maybe change the framework. Yeah, of course, Thomas Hesselden were not working with mass timber buildings and definitely not with CLT. So we cannot blame them for putting these restrictions. But in the modern world, we transition for different reasons, sustainability and so on. We try to transition into more use of biomaterials, mass timber included. Yet the entire framework we have for design and testing these compartments is very, how to say it, historically based on the research, starting with Thomas and Hessel and all other research. So it's interesting that today, looking through the same framework on the modern material, we see different outcomes and outcomes that make sense and we can explain. Another thing that you have reported in your paper were things related to the flows and the discrepancies in temperatures in the compartments. Perhaps we can discuss this more, because if I read it correctly, you've noticed that the peak temperatures in some of the compartments were not at the ceiling where I would expect them to be, but on a different plane of that model. Yeah, so this is probably something that is going to be also scale dependent. So maybe this phenomenon is not going to be observed in all the timber compartments that we can encounter, but I'm not the only person that have observed this either. And this has been observed already in larger scale compartments. So what's happening is that as we are adding more CLT to the compartment, we are adding more fuel. And therefore, what happens is that the oxygen, the air, enters at the bottom of the compartment. And by the time it mixes with the pyrolysis gases, there is basically not enough oxygen to react at the ceiling, underneath the ceiling area. And that's why you create this very fuel-rich oxygen deprived underneath the ceiling. And you develop these lower temperatures. So basically, you will have the highest temperatures somewhere at the interface of this entering flow and exiting flow. So somewhere around the neutral plane height. So it's where the combustion is happening, not exactly where the fuel is produced. Where it's mixing, basically. It's going to happen where the mass eviction mixing happens, with the inflow and the pyrolysis gases, yes. And this, of course, will depend on your geometry. Because if you have, for example, only one wall exposed on the right-hand side from the opening, you will have probably higher temperatures. It's not going to be symmetric. Tell me more about it. Did you observe something like that? I observed that, yes, the dynamics are going away from symmetry. If we, for example, only expose one wall on one side, and that is observed in this temperature distribution across the compartments, but also on the external flame. So if you have a side wall exposed, of course, the flow through the opening is going to be more fuel rich on the side of the opening where this wall is. And therefore, most of the flame is going to be tilted or basically not symmetric. So, yeah, I've observed that. And we've observed this in the small scale, in these medium scale compartments, but also in larger scales. But again, it will also depend on how much of, for example, if you have an exposed wall and a ceiling, in that case, you have such a huge excess of pyrolysis gases that maybe you don't notice anymore this lack of symmetry. So it's really geometry dependent. And were you seeing, because all the surfaces were roughly the same area, were you observing a significant difference if you were exposing, for example, a wall versus exposing only ceiling or from your perspective, not that big? In my experiments, I observed that the ceiling was charming less than the other surfaces, and that was around 30% less on average. Again, it would depend on if I would compare only ceiling versus only wall, or if I would compare tests with ceiling and two more walls. And the hypothesis that we developed was that there are two reasons to it. One is lack of oxygen reaching the ceiling. And the second reason was that we were creating a smoke layer underneath the ceiling, and probably it acts as a radiation shield. So basically there was less heat, relative heat from the fire source reaching the ceiling. And I also cut my CLT samples after the experiments, and I could observe thicker char layers at the ceiling, which kind of gives another argument to the hypothesis that probably there was less oxygen in that area, and that's why the char could not smolder as efficiently as in a wall. What would be the consequence of the building scale? Like, less charring rate means better outcomes, right? rate means better outcomes, right? Of course, you lose slower your cross-section and you can have higher utilization factors for your structural members. And in regards to like layers peeling off the delimitation of or glue line bond failure, whatever people prefer to call it, have you observed any effects of that? Was that influencing your fire dynamics? Have you observed any effects of that? Was that influencing your fire dynamics? learning curve. And eight or seven years later, we have to do so many more experiments to increase our knowledge in this topic because, of course, we now understand these obvious things that I learned in my PhD and now we want to understand these nuances that you are now asking me. So, in my PhD, I tried to exclude the lamination to start with because we wanted to understand this fire dynamics and we knew that the lamination was going to add another variable and at that stage we said okay let's just try to delete this extra variable because it's just going to be too complicated so basically what i did was that the first slamella that was exposed to the fire so the outer layer of micro-laminated timber was quite thick 45 millimeters if i remember correctly and i ensured that the fire duration was not going to go beyond these 45 millimeters however i was doing usually three or four repeats of the same configuration and i was always leaving one repeat long enough to achieve the lamination and see what happens, although it was not the main focus of the study. And it is true that in that scale, in that scale, every time there was the lamination, the fire would just go forever, except for the ceiling cases. If the ceiling was exposed, only the ceiling and I would have the lamination from the ceiling, the fire would eventually have extinguished. But if I would have a ceiling and a wall, then there was too much fuel and heat feedback radiation and it would not have extinguished. And if it was only an exposed wall, the phenomenon that we observed in my test and also in other tests that were happening at the same time was that the delamination would do this pile of char underneath the wall. And, you know, these were just perfect conditions to promote continuous burning because you would have this pile of char at the bottom where the flow of air is entering, going through this pile of char, and then the combustion products would just heat up the wall. But the lamination is a complex phenomenon, and also it depends on the type of glue, on the stresses you put on your element, etc., etc. So, well, we are still studying this, as you know. Yes, I know, of course. And to be honest, when we were doing the large-scale experiments one and two years ago together with OFR, when I first saw, you know, this char build-up next to the wall, it was so kind of stupid and obvious, you know, because you would expect a complex physical phenomena to happen to drive the stuff, but it could be something as simple as you know charcoal falling off the wall and building up a pile next to the wall where it obviously will burn and that's a perfect place to to conserve the fire for a very long time it's it's uh science can be sometimes very simple and just observing that is i think very beautiful part of science to be able to correlate some effects with such simple mechanisms. You've mentioned self-extinction. I mean, this is an award-winning paper, so I have to be very thorough interviewing you about it. So you've observed self-extinction only in the ceiling settings? Non-wall ceiling settings would self-extinguish? No, no, no. I also observed self-extinction in compartments where I had a wall and a ceiling exposed, but not if they suffered the lamination. Ah, okay, okay. So basically, to achieve self-extinction, it is, again, it's very, I think it's quite a difficult phenomenon to predict yet because it is governed by the amount of pyrolysis gases generated at the pyrolysis front of the timber. But there are so many variables that are going to control this pyrolysis gases production in the pyrolysis front that it is very hard to predict. But in the scale of a compartment, the main variables that are going to govern this are the amount of exposed surfaces, because you have this re-radiated heat feedback between the exposed timber surfaces. It's going to depend on the ventilation, because in the decay stage, the ventilation is going to indicate the heat losses from the compartments. And probably the lamination is going to be also one of the main variables, because as we just discussed, if we have this pile of charcoal just lying at the bottom of a wall, probably this is just going to be the perfect condition to just keep burning forever. And in my opinion, it also depends a lot on fire time history. It also depends a lot like fire time history. So this was actually something interesting because I did this test with wood crips and test with kerosene. And the test with kerosene, my fully developed fire was bigger with higher heat release rate and so on. So more severe compared to the wood crips test. But once I was shutting down the pool fire, you know, there was basically no more fuel coming out of the fuel source, and the decay stage was quite steep. And then all the heat generated in the compartment was only coming from this exposed CLT surfaces, right? Whereas in this other experimental campaign, where again the geometry was the same and everything the same but with wood scripts i would not have such a severe fire in the full level of fire but then the decay stage was just slowly slowly slowly decaying for hours sometimes and i had configurations which achieved self-extinction with kerosene pool fire, even though the full level of fire was more severe, but did not have self-extinction with wood cribs. Because these wood cribs also ended up in charcoal, which were delivering enough heat to the compartment to promote continuous burning. But again, this might have been like also skill dependent because, you know, this small scale was just also like a perfect context to keep a lot of heat accumulated in a small volume. But an interesting observation, I would say. Well, self-going fires, you know, if you have a beam next to a wall and a small chunk of exposed ceiling between them is very the same scale as your compartment. And from the tests that I know you know, and we kind of talk about in here, we know that the fire can go on in such nice small spaces for a very long time. So even though your scale was, let's say, medium scale, it also represented it for some construction details in parts of the construction where the fire has a lot of surfaces which can interact with each other. I think this finding is actually quite interesting. Here, the way how self-extinction happens is very fire dynamic dependent. You mentioned the steep burnout curve or very long burnout process. A lot of people would just want a single number at what number the burnout happens or at what number the self-extinction happens. And we also know that in many design projects, the self-extinction would be the number one criteria. Will it self-extinguish or not? That's the question asked, because if it does, then we're great. If not, then we perhaps have an issue. But the matter is, of course, much more complicated. What's your take on this? Having this experience, this knowledge, self-extinction is also the number one design criterion for you? I like a lot the approach of Dr. Juan Cuevas. He basically gives it like a probabilistic approach. As I just said before, there are so many variables that affect self-extinction. So, for example, if the moisture content is, whatever, 20%, then your probability goes up to 0.8. And if your heat flux is above 45, then your probability goes higher again. But it's more like a probabilistic thing, I would say, dependent on several variables. And what was happening in my experiments, this comparison of the kerosene and the wood scripts, was that the wood scripts had this very slow decay phase, and that was inducing this heating condition across the whole CLT slab. So the timber behind the pyrolysis zone was already hot. So you didn't really have heat losses behind the pyrolysis zone. And the moment at which I observed self-extinction in this test was not this typical benchmark number that we use as a threshold for self-extinction, which is around 40 or 45. Because this number is for certain heating conditions right when we assume that your temperature gradient in the timber basically has a certain shape but if the whole timber is already preheated and it's not behaving as a semi-infinite solid because the thermal wave has already reached the other side of the wall basically the temperature gradient is different and you need much less heat coming from the fire to keep your wall burning. You don't have heat losses in your pyrolysis. And now I'm going a bit to the details of pyrolysis. No, no, this is excellent, but this is important for people to realize the differences are in such tiny details and perhaps just talking about one value of heat flux at which it will self-extinguish, and that's our critical value, whatever, that's perhaps a bit naive at some times. So if the fire was a very long duration and the heat has penetrated deep into your structure, this would be different than if you just ignite it and then try to cut down radiation and extinguish, right? Okay. Definitely, definitely. One more thing that I wanted to ask, because you've mentioned that you had a facade outside to measure some stuff happening outside of that compartment. It's not in the paper, but I reckon it's in the PhD, which I'll also link to in the show notes. What were you observing outside? Obviously, if fuel doesn't burn inside, it will burn out. How big the differences were? So it's just as simple as you named it. And, you know, this is, again, one of these very obvious consequences, but it is so obvious that it's not really captured in any standard or codes how to account for that. So that's why I think it was so important to get some data about this, you know, back at the time. So, yeah, I would say there was, I cannot say proportional, but there was very clear correlation that the more exposed timber I have inside in my compartment, the excess of pyrolysis gases would flow out and they would basically increase external flame, but also change its shape. basically increase external flame but also change its shape because for configurations where there was a lot of exposed surface there was such a the flows at the opening were so big that the the it was more like a flame ejection like a horizontal flame ejection which later would by buoyancy go upwards again but it it there was a change in flame shape as well. So yeah, that was also a very interesting finding. Although not every surface contributed the same way because as I said before, the ceilings would contribute a bit less to this. They were burning more or less 30% less than the walls. But again, scale dependency maybe. Perhaps. And you've also observed the flame lengths outside, like how high did the flame reach? Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, it's difficult to say that, to quantify this a bit, we could say that for the same geometry, the baseline test compared to tests where 70% of the internal surfaces were exposed, the flame was five times bigger. But, you know, this term bigger, it can be, you know, visible flame, heat fluxes, what exactly was bigger? But, yeah, let's say that the visible flame, where your flame is basically continuous and not intermittent, this length was maybe five times bigger. And the heat fluxes maybe were like three to four times higher in some sections of the facade, the Ryan heat flux. So basically a much more severe exposure of the facade. And now I'm wondering, you take non-combustible structures, let's say different structures, but they have more or less the same opening factor. They have more or less the same fuel load, let's say their offices. You would expect a very similar behavior of the external heat flux to the building coming from the flames vending outside, because the size of the fire perhaps would be similar. If you get more or less same temperatures inside the compartment, you would perhaps have more or less the same thing outside. Here, the change seems very dramatic, right? Yes, it is true that so far we had over the years, we had tools and models to more or less predict external flaming from compartments. You know, Margaret Law, Cecilia Beccasis, and there is, we have a history of studying this. And these tools and models, they usually assumed a fuel load that was typical for typical residential, commercial, whatever compartments. And then the model was doing correlations with the compartment geometry only. But again, here, I actually tried to apply these models to my compartments. And of course, they were underestimating a lot the external flame. Because again, the assumption of the model was that basically your structure is not adding more this extra fuel so it's definitely like a huge parameter that has to be added to these models that we've been using so far yeah i'm pushing you because you know i'm very how to say it sensitive about the current paradigm that emerges from non-combustible structures, all the experiments done 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, you know, that gave us all the knowledge we have. We base some rules that go into the law, the codes, you know, the separation distances, downstones, things like that, which worked in the previous paradigm. And now comes the timber. And seemingly seemingly it's the same thing. It is completely different when you start looking at the fire dynamics. And suddenly, perhaps, in some cases, our assumptions perhaps still hold, but others could be so far away from working that it's actually quite disturbing. And this is stressing me a lot. And it's very difficult to get that message through. It's very difficult to tell people it's not just the fire resistance. It's not just the charring rate. Look, there are so many different components to look at that. And again, it's also not that we cannot handle it. We don't know anything. We know a lot. It's just you have to meticulously consider those aspects and if you do, there's a good chance you're going to have a safe structure. I fully agree with you. It's not to blame anybody, but I find fires a physical phenomenon that are... We all understand many things because it's not too complex physics. The difficulty of fires is that there are so many variables that this is what makes them complex, right? And of course, to be able to somehow manage this whole fire problem was to narrow it down to certain scenarios and to encapsulate different fires into different regimes so we can apply models to more or less predict. But now we have introduced a huge new big variable, which was not present before. And that's why I call myself like a person that has contributed to define a new fire dynamic model for timber compartments. Because everybody that studies fire safety, we understand what fire dynamics in compartment is but this fire this typical framework that was used until now has changed a lot for timber compartments so the fire dynamics has changed and therefore we have to also update all our models for temperatures inside for external flames for self extingu whatever, that are going to represent this new fire dynamic. Because this new variable that we introduced, this new parameter, exposed timber, it's basically influencing a lot and it's not negligible anymore. Yeah. So now for a grand finale of the episode, let's talk about the final finding. Because you have a plot on which, based on the Thomas Hesselden opening factor, your points are scattered in a vertical line, making no sense, let's say. And then one page later, you have a plot which shows they suddenly fit this growing and decreasing curve of, let's say, Thomas Hesselden framework. So tell me about the modification of the opening factor that you've proposed and how it can be used by engineers. Okay, first of all, the grand idea was of José Torero to do this adjustment. I was not sitting alone in front of my desk and having these brilliant, genius ideas. But it's a very simple proposition. brilliant, genius ideas. But it's a very simple proposition. Basically, in this energy balance that is represented as an opening factor formulation, the term of heat losses is represented as the area of your boundaries, your walls and ceilings. And we said, okay, it doesn't make sense anymore to assume that an exposed CLT surface is going to be a heat losses surface. So we are going to subtract from this term the area of exposed ceiling. So basically we modified the term that represents the heat losses from the compartment and we no longer assume that exposed timber acts as a heat sink. So you let you, let's say, had 100 square meters of walls and 50 square meters of them would be CLT, then you would just calculate the walls as 50 square meters because that's the area where you will have heat losses. Yes. Okay. And it's also important to mention, so I think that for the test, the baseline test and the tests with, I don't remember exactly, 15, 20, 25% of exposed timber, these temperatures, they match Thomas and Hesselden because they are still within this ventilation control regime. And beyond that point, the temperatures start to decrease. starts to decrease. In my case, they start to decrease because the excess of pyrolysis gases makes this inefficient combustion inside the compartment. But the coincidence of these points with Thomas and Heseldon plot is just pure luck. Because the mechanisms for lowering down these temperatures are completely different. In my case, the temperatures go down because there's this excess of pyrolysis gases. The combustion is like super fuel-rich and it's just too much. And in Thomas and Hesselder, what was happening was that he was having huge heat losses through the openings and also a lot of air coming into the compartments. So instead of being fuel-rich, it was oxygen-rich. So instead of being fuel rich, it was oxygen rich. So it is kind of the opposite mechanisms. And it's more like a coincidence that these two floats are kind of matching each other. It's a coincidence. But yeah, it's a nice one this time. Well, it's a nice one. And it's actually great that you have a sound explanation of what's happening. So in this case, evaluating the severity of the fire using this approach, the CLT shall be taken into account, not a surface that takes away the heat from the fire. Plus, on top of that, you should consider all the other aspects that CLT brings into the table that we have discussed so far. Is that something I can recommend to my designers? I think that we could very simplistically look at what are the principles of any fire strategies for buildings. Means of escape, compartmentation, no vertical flame spread like these points. And I think that probably for most of these principles, the presence of CLT is going to have an impact. And it's not only about self-extinguishment, which very often that's what architects think, for example. It's that CLT is introducing new challenges in all the stages of a fire safety strategy. You know, different flame spreads over surfaces, vertical fire spread once the fire is fully developed over the facade, loss of cross-section. If your building is a high-rise building and requires to withstand burnout, you have to ensure some extinguishment. How do we do that? So it's really at all levels of fire safety strategy. Fantastic. Once again, thank you for joining me and congratulations for your award. Once again, I believe after this episode, it's quite obvious why it is a well-earned award because this is not every day someone defines a new view on fire dynamics. So much appreciated. And thanks for being here. And I'm super happy to work with you more on that in short future. Perhaps once the stuff becomes public, we will meet again and discuss the newer findings on this field. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you again for inviting me. I also look forward to work in the future in future projects and again thank you to everybody that helped me to do this this fantastic research and that's it thank you for listening i guess after listening to the interview it becomes apparent why this particular paper was chosen as the best from the previous symposium it's not your everyday thing to find a new phytonetics or find a new correlation to Farmer's and Heselden data, which is a cornerstone for many fire safety considerations. As I have said at the beginning of the episode, I hope you found this interesting. I hope it helped you understand why the mass timber in fire is something really new. I mean, it's not just a new construction material. It changes the fire itself. And how it changes the fire itself, we need to understand that. We need to take this into account when we are designing mass timber buildings, your next future mass timber skyscraper. You need to be aware of what is happening to fire regimes, to the fire itself by introducing timber. And Carmen, as she said, when she started this work, there were so many unknowns. She was doing that when we literally had very little idea on what will be happening. And it is really funny that today some of the things that we have discussed with Carmen, they are kind of obvious, you know, we know that. But we know that because of her research and other research that has happened in the past that moved us further. And today, we can dig much deeper into technical details and you know, some specific, specific issues around mass timber. But it's those big studies at the front, exploratory ones, that put us on this pathway. And I'm very, very pleased that I had the privilege to interview Carmen about one of such stories. Thank you very much for listening. That would be it. I am on my way to Slovenia for SFP conference on sustainability and fire. And it looks it's going to be an amazing event. I'm looking through the list of guests and I'm just astonished about the speakers list. So if you are in Slovenia, please say hi to me and I would love to meet you in person. And if you're not, well, you will have a chance to meet me once again next Wednesday in the next fire science show episode. Thank you.
