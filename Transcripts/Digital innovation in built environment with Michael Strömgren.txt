 Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today's episode is sponsored by the letter I and the word innovation. Well, actually, it's sponsored by all of our consultants, as always, and I'm super grateful for them for doing that. But innovation is certainly something we will discuss in this episode. And it's not just innovation, it's digital innovation. My guest for today, Mike Strongren from a company, Briab, in Sweden, is someone who's known for his knack for performance-based design, and he's always been in the space of performance-based design as long as I remember. And he's now chief of innovation in his company, and he is trying out some really, really interesting things and concepts. I have just recently had Mike Kinsey, who was talking about chatbots and some innovative uses of AI in fire safety engineering. And that was really fun. And today, Mike is taking me into the world of BIM and digital twinning and the digitalization of construction works. of construction works, and together we are trying to find out why we do not have massive performance or massive efficiency gains in the civil engineering industry, or maybe fire safety engineering industry, and how digital innovation can actually help that. What's the benefits of using digital tools in our workloads? How we can streamline the processes? How can we communicate better? And what good can come out of that. And on top of that, the machine-interpreted codes and standards, this is also something that I have just learned from this episode, and it was worth to do this interview just to learn that. So I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this episode. If you are like me, that you like new technologies, and you're excited about the future, this one is for you. So yeah, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. So as I've already mentioned, the podcast is not brought by the letter I, but in collaboration with OFR Consultants. OFR is the UK's leading fire risk consultancy. Its globally established team has developed a reputation for preeminent fire engineering expertise with colleagues working across the world to help protect people, property, and planet. And to give you an idea what types of projects they're involved with, OFR has been involved in the creation of several buildings at King's Cross, including their new home of Meta, which was opened in March 2022. Orfar is also part of the Thomas Hartwig-led design team creating the new landmark campus for Google, described by the Guardian as a landscaper, the building that is as long as the Charlotte Stall. This new headquarters is highly anticipated hub, compromising workspaces and retail and community spaces. If you're interested in working on projects like that, OFR is continuously growing its team and it's keen to hear from industry professionals who would like to collaborate with them. Get in touch at OFRConsultants.com. Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm today here with Mike Strongren from REAP. Hello, Mike. Good to have you in the podcast. Thank you, Wojciech. Nice to be here. Hey, I haven't seen you for such a long while, and now I see your official position in your company is Chief Innovation Officer. That sounds very interesting, and innovation is a thing I would love to discuss with you. So maybe let's start with what's the role of a chief innovation officer in a fire safety company? Working with innovation can be done in many different ways in different companies. But for us, it's been about fostering the culture of innovation. It both means like initiating R&D and getting people along and having an open mindset. We want to try new things and sometimes with internal or external funding. But I think also that a really important thing about innovation is to create value for society, for the industry, for our clients. We really need to be part of the ongoing trends we see in the industry to break the silos that we sometimes get stuck in. We get stuck in wheel tracks. So being part of that is really important to engage with the key stakeholders. And of course, fire and risk is like really important in that area. Sounds like a job I would like, actually. Anyway, Mike, I sometimes struggle with innovation. Usually innovation in the built environment for some reason ends up creating issues for fire safety. At least that's my personal view on the subject. And that's the reason why I have a job and my listeners will have their jobs very secure for the next decades to come because the amount of issues generated in terms of fire safety is tremendous. I wonder, if you start thinking, what drives innovation? Why do we even need to innovate in the space of civil engineering, build environment, and then fire safety? Like, truly, what's the root cause that we do need to innovate? I once thought it's money to make stuff faster and cheaper, but the more I live, the less I think that's the case in how people spend their money on buildings. So what do you think? What's the driver in here? Well, I guess one philosophical answer would be human curiosity. I guess that's one driving force. But of course, there's the business side of it. I think innovators come in industries that are inefficient. There's money to be made by doing something more efficiently, quicker, with better quality. And it's actually crazy with the construction industry. We've had really low productivity gains over the last seven years. I think it's like 1%2% a year productivity growth, and other industries are in general above 3%. In terms of how we build buildings, how we do the installations, how we design? Yeah, exactly. I know there was one comparison in Sweden that we were roughly the same number of employees in the industry, but the productivity hasn't increased. We don't build more buildings compared to the number of people we are in the industry. We can also look at like digitalization comparisons where the construction industry is also much less digitalized. So if you compare to other traditional sectors like agriculture, they are much more advanced using more advanced technology than we are. And the problem is that it's hampering growth. It means that we may not yield higher quality for what we do. And I guess that one complex thing as well is that we have all these different layers of complexity already in the construction sector with all these different things, like a building that could be energy efficient. You should use sustainable material. I mean, you should even declare the carbon footprint of new buildings now. And we're probably soon going to see requirements for a certain level as well. So we're having all this load of requirements for a building that is getting more and more complex, and it should still be safe and reliable, but preferably also cost efficient. So, I mean, it's really hard to do that without doing things in new ways. And that's where we need to be innovative. I think the boundaries we work around, like the codes, the requirements, the standards, in a way expectations, they really make innovating difficult in here. If you are to innovate the process, like you said, the gains in productivity are not that huge in terms of how quickly you put the buildings. Maybe they actually were huge, but in the meantime, the growth of requirements around them has, you know, balanced out the gains that we had, at least on the design side, you know. People were drawing buildings on paper. Now they're doing it with computers. And the design process is, I don't think, that much faster than it used before, because now we take so many more things into account. So what we really need is maybe some sort of paradigm shift, like a real game changer in this field. Exactly. I wonder if this game changer should be in the technological processes, you know, the way how we work, or maybe in the way what's expected of us, how we work. Maybe this thing is kind of broken, like the expectations. Yeah, and I think, I mean, that you're onto something, because I think digitalization and new technology in itself won't change everything. The most important part is how we formulate the goals, the expectations, and how we maybe start working in new processes. I see a lot of things that are counterproductive. We focus a lot on the new building regulations or codes that are for the new stuff. And that's the easy part where we can control what we put into the building and we can use new material that has been tested, etc. But the shift now with increased focus on sustainability and reducing carbon footprints means that we need to utilize the existing built environment more. We need to reuse construction products, which will be adding a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of things that we won't know exactly. So how can we do that with the current business models and the current industry structure? It's going to be a challenge in several ways. I think it's doable, but it's probably have to do this paradigm shift. And that's where the interesting part is with digitalization and new technology, because those are tools that can make us more efficient. We can do things differently. But first we have to start thinking about the process, the incentives, models. Do we have a culture in the industry that facilitates innovation that can also be safe. Do you think that the shift to circular economy, sustainability, reuse, having the end of life of a building included in the costs, is this the drivers for innovation of the future of the next decade? Yeah, I think it's one of the drivers, definitely. I think it's going to massively impact the construction industry in the coming decades. I wonder how do you think fire safety can fit in that in two ways. One way is how products innovated for those needs. How do we make sure those do not change the fire safety equilibrium we have on the building? Let's make a bold assumption for the case of this podcast that today's buildings are safe. That's a bold assumption, but let's assume that. So how do we assure that the new technologies innovated for the purposes we've mentioned do not make our buildings unsafe? And the second part is how do we make a dedicated fire safety solutions to increase safety or provide a different angle on safety in the future? Yeah, I think it's really important for research to keep up with new technology and that we have processes to make sure that we implement new technology in a sound way. the way. And that's one area that is a bit problematic because I see that research, evaluation, and not least following up the implementation of new technology, that is usually lagging behind. And we risk having this effect that we start introducing new technology on a quite big scale. And then only in the aftermath, we will realize that, oh, we should have thought of that, this and that. And I guess it's like maybe to some part has to be that way, because otherwise it would maybe be too costly and maybe too hard to do it. But I think we need to be more agile in our approach, but also embrace new technologies. It's a balance, but really make sure to be more agile and quick to follow up. I see the extreme ends in here, like one in which we ban all new technologies until they're proven safe. So that's one extreme. Another is you allow everything and see what happens. And both ends are probably bad for society. And in terms of products, you can either approve a product, put it on the market with a full testing certification, everything that's needed for a product to be placed on the market. You can put them with absolutely zero control. Again, two ends of the spectrum. I wonder if there's a solution lying in the middle ground that allows us to pre-check how horrible a thing can be. So we, in a way, greenlight the development of an innovation. Let's imagine someone innovated a thing for climate control in buildings. It's just super fire, dangerous, and eventually will get banned because of that. So what a waste of resources to innovate in such a space when fire can lead to preventing this technology from reaching the market. I wonder if we as a fire community can have a role in innovation of others, but not to be perceived as the sad guys blocking old ideas, but as the guys who can make sure what you're doing will not backfire on everyone else. One important thing is to have an open mindset. I mean, we need a culture of innovation also in our trade to really try new grounds. And of course, someone has to ask the difficult questions too. So, I mean, we should keep doing that, but also find the balance. I think there's also several strategies that can be employed. We definitely want this product where you maybe test reusing products from an old building and we need to learn from those and those cases and we need to identify the barriers what could prevent us from doing this what are the obstacles what's key here to reach forward the interesting thing is it's also the shift towards a circular it could potentially be an opportunity for us to be engineers utilizing performance-based design. Because when we reuse old products or if we want to repurpose an old building, we need to assess the current state. We need to make assumptions. We need to use all the engineering knowledge we have. Of course, within our own capacity, we need to know where are our limits. Do I have the data to know the fire performance of this 30-year-old fire door or whatever? What could support me doing these assumptions? And can I really put this old fire door in a staircase, maybe the only staircase in the building, is it a good place or should I only use it as like for the less important fire compartments as a part of the fire safety strategy? I actually love the renovation, repurposing of buildings. I think that's fundamental for sustainability to actually use what we already have in the best fashion. And it also comes with a challenge for the future designs because you have no idea what your building will be in 50 years, but it better be fire safe, right? And with fire elements, I wonder if at some point we should consider to design our building in a way that it could be actually dismantled into pieces in a way that you can reuse them reasonably. Yeah, definitely. We actually had a building like that for the world exhibition in Dubai. It was the Swedish pavilion, so we did the fire safety for that building, and it was completely made in timber. Even the foundation was timber. And everything was done to be able to be dismantled, to be reused. Which has made us to be super fashionable, actually. Yeah. Which is the point of the expo yeah anyway in all of this i know you're very involved with with information technologies and digitalization of the construction works and a lot of stuff that comes from your research is very related to the design process with the use of of modern tools like bim So now going into this part of innovation, I really wonder, like, what's your take on where BIM is or building information modeling is in the fire landscape, let's call it like that. Where can a fire safety specialist benefit from this turn of the design process from paper and ink to fully digital with shared resources and clouds and everything that's really interesting because we've been exploring that for several years we started our first BIM project in 2016 even before I started at Bria and there's so many different things now I'm at the point where I look at digitalization from the lifecycle perspective. I think the digitalization has the potential to tie all the information or all the relevant information from the start of a construction product into the construction phase, design, construction, and then into the operation and maintenance of the building. And then you will find tons of these different applications. And the one we start here with is the design perspective, as you said. And that's where we, I mean, that's the core of what we do as well. We work in consultancy services. I think the greatest benefit today is that when we work in a BIM environment in design product, we collaborate much more closely with the other disciplines. We didn't used to do that in the same degree, not in all projects at least. With working in BIM, we can instantly sync the fire safety part of the product with other disciplines. We can communicate the issues more closely with others. We can identify the crashes between different disciplines. Maybe the architect moved a wall or changed something that affects the fire compartments, or maybe the services consultants are changing the ducts or pipes or whatever, which will in turn affect the penetration seals of a fire compartment. So I think it's essentially, we would like to collaborate with fire safety design with other disciplines more efficiently. And we do that. I think we have great examples of doing that in the past too. But BIM and the new technology just makes it so much easier to communicate. And to me, that's one of the cores. I mean, it's one thing being an engineer and doing this great technical solution and creating a good fire safety strategy for the building. But it's a completely different thing implementing it and making sure that you don't screw up other things in the buildings. That's a complexity of construction where you have to understand the whole building and still making sure that it's safe. And that's where BIM is really helping us. I really like this moment in the development of the technology where it catches up with the existing one you've been using so for me bim was this annoying tool where yeah to draw at the same building in in in revit and you know to to make it really work out and not crash and load on a computer and make a slice you know all these simple things that if i just use autocad it, it was 100 times simpler, like so much faster, so much easier. And you put a new technology into use and it's just simply annoying because from your perspective, it does worse than the previous one. But at some point it catches up, it becomes as annoying as the previous one. But suddenly you open a horizon of possibilities that with the previous technology you could never do. So you have the same tool, but the potential of it is endless. Where do you see a potential for BIM in future use outside of the design perspective? You said that you're investigating lifecycle perspectives. One thing that's really interesting is to keep track of different layers of fire safety. In my perspective, there's one requirement or maybe specification layer for fire safety. So from the design phase, we know that there may be certain conditions, for example, the limitation of the number of people in a certain fire compartment or part of a building. There are certain requirements for products and fire protection systems that are installed. And then it's a different information layer of what was actually built. Sometimes you actually exceed those initial requirements and the conditions and requirements may also change over time. There may be other things that push those or change the requirements. And keeping those separate, then you would be able to incorporate into facility management systems and different applications. And that's really interesting. But then you can also, we even did a project with IoT last year where we actually could compare the state of a fire protection door to the requirements and what the state should be. So that's opening up tons of different applications. Following this trail of your IoT implementation, so at that point, the BIM and the building are not two separate beings, but it essentially becomes one thing because you use BIM to visualize the state of the building as it is, as it's living, changing, and you can use BIM to understand what's happening in the fire automation, for example. Can you tell me a little more how you integrated those? Yeah, sure. So in the project we did last year, it was a product connected to the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. So in that case, there was a platform sort of for digital twin, and there was this technology to keep track of sensor data, and it was able to integrate with the BIM model too. So I guess I'd rather at that point talk about the digital twin of the building, where you may utilize BIM models as like a part of that structure, and then have this platform for the sensors and sensor data too. So in this case, the live building would be yielding data from its network of IoT sensors to the digital twin on which you work to process the data. Right. Okay. And it could also be integrated with the facility manager's platform. facility managers platform. So, for example, if you do a minor renovation where you replace a door or you install a new HVAC system, then you would need to update the data for the building too to make sure. So the idea is to have a digital twin that is updated over time and essentially having both the requirement and the information for the building. Tell me more about it. It's really interesting how these IoT sensors were... What you were information for the building. Tell me more about it. It's really interesting how these IoT sensors were, like what you were gathering from the building, how you were processing it, and what could be done with the knowledge you got from processing that data? Yeah, so I guess I'm not an expert on the technical side of that platform, but essentially we tried a couple of different proof of concepts. And this project was about IoT and identifying what's needed information infrastructure-wise. Fire safety was the proof of concept, so we were involved for the fire safety part. We collaborated with another Swedish company called Presto on the sensor technology. We decided to try two different products. One was a fire extinguisher, where we had a sensor that could report the pressure of the extinguisher if it had been moved. And then as a bonus, you also would get stuff like temperature as well. And then we had a sensor for a fire door as well, so you could get the state if it was open or closed. And also all the bonus information regarding temperature and humidity as well. This was going to the digital twin? And was it only visualizing? Was it processing? Was it like checking if everything is consistently okay? How did this proceed with it? Yeah, it would be checking that the sensors were live and that they were reporting and you would get the state, the temperature, the door closing. And you could also, the application side would be to add triggers perhaps. If the fire door is open or open for a certain time, then you would need a trigger or a warning that it has been reached. I really wonder if we will end up with a completely new engineering disciple in the digital twin engineer personhood, building the twins of existing buildings. It's very interesting, the stuff that you can do with that. And I guess for your digital twin, you can add and add more information sources and better and better processing, I guess. And I think one thing that's interesting, I mean, we have to ask ourselves, why are these things important? Because we're talking about the fire safety management of a building. That's one area where we think it could help a lot. So if you look at a school in Sweden, it's usually the principal who is responsible for the fire safety. It's usually the janitor who is responsible for doing these weekly or monthly checks. And they have so much other things on their plate. I mean, their fire safety is necessary compliance, but they are not engineers. They are worried about the children's education and all the practicalities every day. The janitor is maybe the guy who is also serving and supporting with tons of other stuff. So anything we can do to simplify fire safety, communicating it more clearly, providing support could be of great benefit, I think. It's one of those areas where we really could get impact. And I have tons of these examples. I was staying at a hotel last year and the fire door to the hotel corridor was open. Someone put it open because they were moving something in or whatever. I mean, it happens all the time and it could take days before someone realizes it. Instead of having this automated procedure where you could eliminate certain things. Automated monitoring so someone can react doesn't involve a fire protection specialist because you also probably don't hire a person that's only doing that that's only running around the building or checking if extinguishers were not moved. So it's a lot of mundane repetitive tasks and I assume in our buildings we would choose to not do actively that. You would only have someone go do a walk repetitive tasks and i assume in our buildings we would choose to not do like to not do actively that you will only have someone go do a walk through every i don't know a week or two weeks a month i guess depending on the building but not continuously and you would not invest in a person to just do that because the gain is let's say not so much in terms of safety like you would not see the the direct benefit from hiring the person unless you have a fire and it saves someone's life, right? But here doing it with automated system that costs a fair premium on the base coast, you reach this additional layer that you did not have before and you may have more safety. I wonder if this could find a way to the world of ensuring or or like other measurable benefits to the building owners outside of just having safety for a lot of billing owners and facility managers they already have this requirement to comply with regulations and do checks so for them it could be a way of doing it more efficiently, maybe more cost efficient too, and also integrate it with other parts of the building. I know that they lack a lot of data today when they are doing renovation and other stuff. They may not have all the data needed to do that efficiently. Then, of course, I mean, there's also challenges. If we're going down this path, it's happening and the sensors are getting cheaper and cheaper. But we're also getting immense amounts of data. I mean, how do we prevent that from overburdening us? And how do we value and prioritize? I think if you would go to any building today, you would always find some flaws and faults in the fire safety of the building. But you would also agree that not all of these faults are critical for life safety. Some of them are more important than others. So that's also an important part where we as engineers maybe need to be better at really finding the big stuff. Because if we focus on all these nitty gritty pieces, they should be, of course, we should be compliant. But some things are more important than others and i think we as engineers are the trade who could do that evaluation this brings me to a question that i wanted to ask because based on the materials you shared with me you've highlighted the role of errors in the building process like the tiny things that go wrong when you are building the building or when you're maintaining it that add up and change the level of fire safety in the world and how the use of digital technologies can be used to reduce this error footprint, if I may. So let's go there. What was your idea about the role of errors and how can we mitigate that? Errors is a really interesting area. And it actually started at the time when I was at SP or RISE. I was a bit concerned about the complexity of certain systems that we introduce in buildings. I had an opinion piece about facade fire safety more than 10 years ago, the complexity of that. And also we have this interaction between different technologies, like having a smoke ventilation system that needs to work with several other fire safety systems of the buildings. Sometimes we see that errors are almost bound to happen in the building. And then there was an increased focus in Sweden on construction errors. And it also ties back to the inefficient nature of our construction industry. And I think it's a global concern. It's not just a Swedish problem. So in Sweden alone, there's been estimates by the national government that we have a cost of between 5 to 10 billion euros a year in construction errors. So an individual product could have a cost of construction errors from maybe 5 to 20, 25 percent, which is huge. And the strange thing is that the explanation to why do we accept this? Because it means that we have a higher cost for each building. We have a bigger carbon footprint for each building due to these construction errors. And it's probably due to the incentives models and the business models that we work in. It's hard for any party in the construction process to make a big difference because you're all stuck in this chain of events. But still things can be done. We see things going wrong at the design side. Sometimes it's miscommunication, or we may lack competence maybe in a certain area, and we're a designer or an erosive engineer. Or it could be things happen at the construction site that were not predicted. Maybe it's a crash or it's a conflict of these different objectives for the building, so you end up doing a different solution than what proposed initially because it's simply not possible to fulfill to do the solution that was proposed or things could happen during the life cycle of the building it could be poor maintenance you do penetrations in a fire compartment wall afterwards and so on so we have all this data now. We see that row houses in Sweden like this is single homes that are usually built in a row. We've had investigations that show that like half of them, half of the investigated row houses in Sweden have some kind of fire safety deficiencies. So these errors are huge and we should definitely do something about it. We had this funny occurrence where we were presenting results of, actually it was a facade experiment that we've been doing, and someone from the audience, after the presentations, said, oh yeah, but these results are not very representative, because in reality you have a lot of errors when you do these things, and in laboratories they're usually perfect. And my response was, no, no, don't worry. We built them our own. They were horrible. They were full of errors. We made sure that they were in line with how the real world looks like. But, okay, I guess it's kind of obvious that accumulation of errors will lead to the decrease in fire safety. And it's maybe even obvious that the lack of communication between branches, you know, closing in silos leads to unexpected combinations of effects from different branches that eventually may lead to a fire unsafe system. But do we have some idea, any idea, how to reduce this error footprint? You've mentioned systems perspective on that. I think we need a system perspective. And I guess there's maybe not a simple solution. We did an internal study on common errors. And we saw things like penetration seals getting wrong. And we were seeing the wrong fire resistance classes being implemented in practice on doors for a wall or whatever we have the shafts for like ducts and services in the building stuff like that but i think that we need we need a combination sometimes we may need the review and control systems could be more efficient we probably need to work more on in more in the early design stages and also follow through when we implement it to make sure that things are communicated properly. We need to collaborate more with others and understand what are the problems and what are potential crashes. So one thing that we've seen helps is collaborating in the BIM environment. It reduces the errors. It makes it easier to understand the building and the different parts of the building and these potential crashes. We also see that we need to give more time on communicating with the other disciplines and collaborating with them to understand the problems and to solve things together, working more as a team. That's also part of, I think, breaking the silos and understanding each other. One of the problems with our more and more complex buildings, it's harder and harder. It's not just one person who can understand everything. You need to work together. The challenge, of course, is that in many projects, you don't have the budget to do that. And that's also a paradox because we have these construction errors that cost a lot for most projects, but we still don't have the budget to do things right. If there would be a trade-off, you would be able to put a little bit more time collaborating, getting things right, and avoid the construction cost. There would be a benefit. I wonder how to act on these errors, on these accumulation errors, when you actually are faced with a renovation project or refurbishment, change of use, where inevitably you face some accumulation over time on every building. That's inevitable. And it's also unrealistic to remove them all or maybe unnecessary to remove them all. So you need to find some sort of tolerance for errors maybe. And again, a way to trace them and a way to understand them from a system perspective like this hole in this wall which was a firewall okay it it uses the value of this firewall as a firewall but maybe in my project this wall does not have to necessarily be the wall of this quality because the use changed so maybe i can live with that error and move on. Is this again something going back to digitalization beam and this exchange of information between branches that's much more close, intimate, direct? I think so. I think digitalization itself is giving you the better information and you're able to take better decisions. I think it's going to challenge some of the things we do today, because today we're a bit ignorant or blind. We have so little data about our building stock today, and every time we start doing inspections, we're surprised at what we find. Like Autogranful, you find thousands of buildings that have really critical fire safety protection problems. And it's the same in Sweden, you find these things, but it has to be assessed by engineers. We don't see all the hazards or we don't see the full effect of these construction areas that we see don't always lead to these hazards. Why is that? I mean, what is really important? I think that's our main focus. We should really catch the worst things as a priority, but we need the culture to do that and to learn and to develop. Because right now, I think we have several countries that are facing the risk of having these systematic building errors, like a new Grenfell situation. We have several buildings that have a similar type of loss. We've seen it in several other areas, like structural engineering and in moisture protection, etc. So a lot of countries have experienced these systematic building errors. I'm also wondering to what extent machines can support engineers in fighting those, and machines could take a role of engineers in some of the tasks. We've already briefly talked about some potential uses in automation in this podcast episode. In your work, you've also touched on the idea of machine-readable codes and standards or some sort of algorithmic codes, which for me sounds like a step towards steam engine of engineering, like moving from handwork into machine-supported work. So please tell me more about the machine-readable standards. The machine-readable codes, it's also related to this idea of digital information trail. We had a product called the Unbroken Chain of Information for Fire Safety, where we explored this code compliance perspective, and we explore this code compliance perspective. And we're still pursuing that trail. It's also a bit akin to the Golden Thread of information in the UK, like the idea of having this information trail. So for me, one really important part is the early stages when you start a design. You have the compliance to relevant regulations, but also other requirements, maybe from insurance companies, etc. So what we tried to do in that project, we worked with the Norwegian Building Authority and also did tests on the Swedish building regulations, where we built fire safety requirements in code by algorithms instead. in code by algorithm instead. And we realized that a lot of the way we work in fire safety design is about code compliance, not everything. I mean, some parts really need some engineers' involvement today, but some parts are quite straightforward, and especially for an ordinary product like a five-story residential building. So in those cases, we use this regulatory engine, sort of like a digital platform. So we could add building data for a specific product, could add certain properties to the different parts of the building, like fire compartments in a certain level in the building. We could add building data for the building, etc. in a certain level in the building. We could add building data for the building, etc. So following the Swedish or Norwegian codes, we could, based on adding these conditions for a certain fire compartment, we could run the regulatory engine and then populate the fire doors with a certain fire class, for example, or the reaction to fire requirements for the different services. And then we also tried APIs to communicate with the platform. So we even tried importing the data from the Norwegian building authorities, from their code by API into the platform. And then we could also, by API, communicate with a third-party software on the market, like a BIM platform, and then populate the actual BIM database with the file safety data for that billing. So potentially, it's like a seamless trade where you could get this compliance connection between requirements and the billing model. And compliance is, in a way, automatically assured by just following the process. It's demonstrated that it is compliant. You don't have to... Yeah, exactly. I mean, you may have to check other things. You might have to check the input data and that the data is correct, etc. But the interesting thing is that you're also very agile to changes. So if there's changes in the product, you maybe change the areas or the use of a certain fire compartment, then you could just run the engine again and you would get a different result. I think this is one of these paradigm shifting technologies because the current way how we design is pretty much based on the fact that you have milestones. In Poland, for example, you want to have a building permit design that is signed off by everyone and approved by authorities, and you're not allowed to change it unless you ask for the permit again, and it takes months to get the permit. Then you go into execution stage design, when you cannot move too far away from the project because it has been signed off and approved. So in a way, the fact that the permit or the project is signed is proof of compliance and you're not allowed to move away from that. If someone suddenly wants, instead of one thousand square meter office, they would like three offices, 350 or something. We have to go into some tricks, you know, shell and core concept and stuff. But basically what we're fighting is the fact that our designs are rigid and unmovable. Because if you change something, nobody can guarantee that it's still compliant unless you go through the whole process again. And if you're on a thread that requires compliance as essence, like the thread is compliance itself, you maybe could have a more dynamic, more agile project structure. And we're stepping a little bit away from the original design as long as the whole building compliance is managed, it would be possible. So I see the potential in it. And I think that, I mean, the challenge for us is that the construction process and also the life of the building itself is dynamic. So having a system where you do checks at a certain time or like a timestamp check, it's also limiting because, I mean, you know there's going to be changes and challenges along the way. It's going to be hard to implement certain things. So I think it would be a paradigm shift to change how we look at the compliance process. Why do we do compliance checks at a certain time instead of looking at it like maybe a certified compliance process or, I mean, a different way of looking at it, where you follow maybe you should be using certified digital twins of the relevant regulations instead. Continuously monitor the compliance and how much you diverge from compliance and what do you propose to offset that instead of a single point of check where you submit and wait for a review, then are destroyed by the authorities, then you... Yeah, exactly. You've mentioned at the beginning of the episode that the gains were minor because this process has not changed, actually. You know, we change from ink to computers, but the process is essentially the same. And the business models are the same. So, I mean, it's limiting us. You get these efficiency improvements, but only a small part of the process. We're not getting the big shift. I think we're living in a fantastic time for fire safety engineers, where all the puzzles are coming together in the build industry, ability to work closer with others, the automated tools to support you. In modeling, maybe not huge gains in terms of how good models are, but at least the equipment we're using to model is quicker and quicker. And every time a new tool comes up that simplifies processes and makes it more widely available, I wonder one day will CFD modeling become just a natural part of BIM model and then you'll just click in your Revit model, I want the fire here, and it does it. Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a great example. We didn't talk much about that yet, but there's the engineering side as well. If we do the routine compliance checks more smoothly, then we would also potentially be able to evaluate more design ideas. We could have more time to focus on the really big problems in the product, maybe where you need the engineering tools to evaluate the smoke spread or movement of people and so on. Can this framework accommodate performance-based engineering or it must be rigid to the codes? I think it could be complement. I mean, you easily use the framework as well. And this, the idea of these checks and the regulatory engine to identify where you need the engineer, when you need an engineer and what competence you need, for example, because we could probably identify where this is where the engineer has to be responsible and do something. And with all the data of the building, I also see that it can be easier to do good engineering analysis using modeling. using modeling. Because then you have the data on compartments, you have the geometries of the building, and it's also more up-to-date with the latest changes by other disciplines, for example, in the product. So it could facilitate that process too. And on this, I've started an episode that is going to be about innovation. We've ended up mostly about digital innovation, but I like it a lot. The future sounds exciting. What do you think we're on a time scale of these innovative processes? When do you think things that we've talked today will be a part of engineers' routine? Today, five years from now, ten years from now? I guess it's like at this time, it's so hard to predict what's going to happen. Like one year ago, I was thinking that, well, the Swedish language is like, it's a small language, we have a really slow construction industry, like it's very analog. And I was thinking that, well, it's going to take some time before AI is picking up speed. And now we have ChatKeyPT, which is like fluent in Swedish almost. I mean, it's writing really good stuff. Things are happening so fast. In Polish too, yeah, that's scary. Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, even for these like minor languages. I mean, I understand English. I mean, there's been really good stuff for English for quite a while, but it's, I mean, it's stunning. So it's really hard to predict, but I mean, I see that things that we really need to be working with is digital information infrastructure. We need to start making the tire safety and construction data more readily available. I think that's one of the hurdles that we see now. In part, it's like a labor-intense industry, but it's also traditional and analog in many ways. intense industry, but it's also traditional and analog in many ways. So by digitalizing what we do, I think that's one of the factors that are going to be important for us to see the big improvements. And I guess it's also, I know that there was one professor, Bengt Flieberg in UK, he was saying that industries who are productive, they may become players from the outside of the industry that may challenge us. I think that's the risk that we face too, and that's a good potential accelerator. Either someone within the AEC industry or someone from outside could come in and start to turn things around, because I think with a low productivity rate, the low digitalization, there's a massive business opportunity. And also, I guess, if we go back to the challenge of human curiosity, I mean, it's a puzzle why the industry hasn't moved further. So I think someone is going to do it someday, but I don't know how fast. I would put forward that the current drivers for innovation were not strong enough. Like time and money, yeah, sure, it's important and many people would put forward that the current drivers for innovation were not strong enough. Like time and money. Yeah, sure. It's important that many people would care about that. But for the last 50 years or even more, we had time and money as the sole incentive in driving innovation. And looking at the statistics, it did not happen i wonder if the modern drivers sustainability cooler economy and maybe or maybe what you just said the the window of opportunity and competition potentially from outside will did those be the dominant drivers that that will eventually make these breakthroughs in the world like the ones that we need to really jump not not just move on the one percent slope but but use a jetpack and fly up there on the pinnacle of efficiency. But I think the public and the government and the politics has a big role here too. But one observation is that I think in some countries you have this, like the Norwegian Billing Authority, they have a mission to work towards code compliance, and I know that Finland will start delivering billing permits using Open BIM or IFC. And I think most countries have these digitalization strategies. But in some countries, it's more business-driven. There's still these yields for business that is accelerating digitalization. there's these yields for business that is accelerating digitalization. And we see the use of BIM today much more being used than just like three years ago. So I could imagine that that's going to grow continuously for the next five years. And once we start to digitalizing, then we're going to see these applications popping up as well. That's going to speed up. So hopefully it could start accelerating once we get the data and the structure, because that's one of the obstacles. If this happens in the next 10, 20 years, it's going to be amazing because it's, I guess the moment you live in the moment where it starts to accelerate is the most exciting of all. Exactly. I'm looking forward to that. As a final word from me, keep the responsibility in the back of our heads as engineers because these buildings will live longer than us and we just need to make sure that future engineers can do some stuff with them also. Any final words? Well, careful doing any forecast here. I know you would come back in five years and hold me responsible. Of course, of course I would. It's what gets me clicks, man. I need this. No worries. I actually appreciate it because we were talking not about forecasts and dreams, but real projects, implementations, case studies, and stuff that you really did touch in professional career. And I think all these things we've discussed today were very exciting. And it's even more exciting to know many of those already exist in either a form of case study or project or at least early development. But it's not science fiction. It's the things that are being developed and are coming our way. So engineers need to be wary. Thanks, Mike. It was a huge pleasure as always and see you around thank you it was a pleasure being here and that's it thank you for coming mike that was a great pleasure to have you here i actually thought i'm gonna wrap it up but i kind of did in the interview itself it's not that easy to add something to that so maybe i'll share an ex experience with you we're talking about the digital innovation and how products change when they come and sometimes they're annoying. Actually, this just happened to me because my audio editing software changed interface just as I was going into editing this episode. And it was such a horrible experience to discover the interface from the scratch after I've done like 80 episodes with the previous one. But now as I am at the end of the episode, I am actually fluent in the new interface. Yay, I can live with this software again. And I find it like kind of funny metaphor of what has been said in this particular podcast episode about how new solutions come and how new solutions open new pathways to you once they catch up so i really wonder what this editing software will open for me in the future coming back to fire safety engineering a lot is happening digital transformation is something that we live through we need to learn these tools we need to learn how to live with these tools and how to benefit from them because it's not a choice. We will have to do that anyway. So thanks for joining me and Mike. I hope it was a pleasure for you as well. you for listening and see you soon.
