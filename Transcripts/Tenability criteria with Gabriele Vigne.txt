 When you studied fire safety engineering, or maybe when you joined your first consultancy company and was trained to work on fire safety engineering projects, at some point you most likely encountered the thing that we call the tenability criteria. The tenability criteria are the conditions within the building or a part of a building that if they are reached, it means the building became untenable. And that means that the building is not safe anymore. It's a very profound concept in fire safety engineering to use these values to define when the safety ends in the building. And in consequence, most of the design of safety features in the building, such as smoke control, for example, is driven by this need to provide the safety for a certain amount of time. Because the sustainability criteria are so profound for our buildings and the safety in them, we tend to study them in depth. study them in depth. And this is why I brought today my second guest to the podcast, Dr. Gabriela Viña from JVVA in Spain, who happens to be a researcher and an engineer interested in tenability criteria from both the scientific and practical perspective. Together with Gabriela, we have a history of research on visibility in smoke. And now we've opened a new chapter. We've just finished an international survey on the use of tenability criteria in fire engineering, which was attended by 250 engineers worldwide, which we're very happy with. And in this episode, we're going to dive deep into the results of the survey. We'll discuss what surprised us in the survey, what did not surprise us. We will then jump into the visibility in smoke, which is something we share the passion about. And in the end, I'll explain, Gabriele, some of the newest research from my group that lays a new light on how we perceive the visibility in smoke. So whatever is your role in fire safety engineering, you're definitely going to enjoy this one, and I hope it will be very beneficial for you. I hope the perspectives given are very wide and will help you see things in a new light. I'm absolutely sure you will enjoy it. So without further ado, let's spin the intro and jump into the interview. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I will be your host. Hello everyone. Today I'm hosting my good friend Gabriel Gabriel Wynne from JVVA, Fire and Risk Consultancy. Gabriel is an engineer and researcher, and I'm more than happy to have you here, Gabriel. Hey, Wojciech. It's a pleasure to be here in this fantastic podcast. We'll see. We'll see. I hope it is. So I brought Gabriel here because together we have a history of cooperation on some interesting topics. And since we are both engineers and we both deal with design of smoke control systems and all the stuff related to making buildings safer for the life of humans, safer for the life of humans, we've both met the same problems with sustainability conditions. Gabriel? Yeah, well, when we started with that, we identified this visibility as one of the main issues and the thing to study more deeply. Yeah, visibility is the culprit of engineering because it's at the same time extremely easy to explain to anyone. You can explain the concept of visibility in smoke to your grandmother. I mean, you can see for a given distance, that's it. And yet, to capture the value of that parameter in your high-fidelity engineering analysis is a really, really painful task. So for this purpose, to learn how we use the ability criteria and to learn what is driving the design of buildings in today's engineering world, of buildings in today's engineering world, we joined our forces with some researchers, with Professor Lukasz Arnold from University of Wuppertal, with Dr. Wolfram Jan from Chiller, and our colleague Mateusz Zinne. And we've started a really interesting project, the Tenability Criteria Survey. Gabriel, can you tell us a bit more about the survey? Yeah, well, actually, we started this survey to understand worldwide how people use these tenability criteria in safety file modeling. And actually, it's so easy nowadays to make a survey and collect information from all parts of the world. This was just posted in Twitter, in LinkedIn. We didn't even send messages to people. And it spread all over the world. And then there was a bit of a run and a competition between countries as well because when we post this graph and saying, hey, look, you are pretty low in the result, some French people posting that, hey, come on, man. That explains the high number of French participants. Exactly, exactly. And that was fantastic. Absolutely great. Absolutely great. I think it was a great success. And I'm preparing right now. Well, it's prepared already, but I will be giving classes to the municipality of Madrid, their technician about evacuation modeling, and we'll be focused on Pathfinder, actually. But there is a strong introduction about the human behavior and evacuation modeling itself. And I used a lot of information from the survey that Ronchi and Lorelio did for evacuation modeling. Why that? Because when you have a benchmark of how the model is used all over the world, etc., etc., and so many questions in it, you really have an overview and you understand how those models are used. So I really think this survey will highly contribute to this field. Yeah, my goal was to ask two or three very, very particular questions. particular questions and to get an honest answer to them, I've hidden them beyond the wall of many, many other questions. So so people are get are more comfortable answering and clicking through. But you know what? I'm really surprised because the data gathered like for almost every single question we got is astounding. And it's, like I mentioned before, full of golden nuggets in there. And from here, I would like to really thank every single person who participated in the survey. It's worth a lot to us to have your opinion on how the vulnerability criteria are used. And also huge thanks to everyone who helped us organically spread the information about the survey through the Internet. So looking now at the participation chart, it seems we had 252 participants. That's amazing. That's a quarter of a thousand of people. That's amazing. That's a quarter of a thousand of people. And most of them are engineers, like 81% are engineers who actually do fire modeling. So that's a pretty decent representation. Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's the right representation. I like this answer because can you imagine this 81% if it was a researcher or lecturer? We want, and I think the good thing here is that we are both engineers. You are more on the scientific and research path now. But we know that what we are studying, and that was the intent, that what we are studying and that was the intent for example of all my research to contribute to my profession not just to study something because you know I want to expand the bogger lumber beer equation better ok I want a result that can be applied tomorrow into our field and that's a key a key thing it's fascinating that you say that because i think my my my path of career was very similar i i i was a bottom level cfd engineer a guy who was doing a model and and and starting the calculations and then printing pretty plots out of that. And at some point I started questioning the outcomes or the choices or the reasons why we do stuff like we do. And that pushed me into the research career where I seek answers for questions that were unanswered when I was doing the engineering. So I always say it's selfish science because I do science for myself. I touch problems that bother me, and I think it makes the science very useful. Here to close the participation chart, I must mention the top three participating countries, and it seems number one was UK, two was poland good job guys and number three was germany so um yeah very strong european uh representation in the survey but we also had participants from iran australia new zealand chile many from usa so so it's definitely a global survey. Yeah, and to be honest, if you have two to three people in the same countries, you have already an answer on how that criteria or many other answers apply to that country. So the result is absolutely great. We also had most of the participants being active users of the CFD tools, like 70% of the participants were doing simulations by their own, and 17% of the participants were ones who have a supervision role on CFD. And one more thing interesting from the scatter of our participants, 94% of them are familiar or use FDS as the tool of CFD. So, well, that's kind of not surprising. No, it doesn't surprise me at all. The funny thing is to see some PyroSim. Oh, yeah. We have a group of people who mentioned PyroSim is the CFD code, which is also interesting. I wonder what Brian will say about that. Well, here you have to mention that we have also a very healthy mix of veterans and newbie participants because we had 43% of people with experience in CFD of more than 10 years and a very similar number of participants who just start with CFD in their first years of engineering career. So a very, very good mix between veterans and newbies. And also, Wojciech, one thing, the professional education is quite interesting as well because having 56% that study fire safety protection engineering, that's a lot, because we know that we have a substantial problem that we don't have so many universities teaching fire safety engineering. That's true, especially that we have a lot of participants from Spain, for example, where you don't have a structure of teaching fire safety engineering as a master's program, right? I don't think you have. And there's probably many more countries that do not have a structured way to educate fire safety engineers. Yet more than 50% of the participants said that their professional education is fire safety engineering, which is great. which is great. So the main part of the survey was to ask the participants what kind of ability do they use in performing asset analysis, life safety analysis. The first two answers are very obvious because 80% of people are using temperature, 90% of people are using visibility. So that's something that does not shock me. But I was pretty surprised, like other more complex sustainability criteria are still being fairly well used. Yeah, well, I think that's all the things we put here, they come from the state of the heart and best practices. So, you know, as a fire safety protection or whatever engineer, you know that you have these branch of criteria that you need to evaluate. And also, there are codes, international codes or just local code that require this kind of often ability criteria. It didn't surprise me that the most used are visibility and temperature. It did not surprise me either. But I'm still surprised that like 50% of our participants have used mass density of smoke or smoke concentration as a criterion, mass density of smoke or smoke concentration as a criterion, especially that it takes some effort to plot that in FDS, while visibility is the simplest way to show that. Also, we had a good number of people using gradient heat fluxes, gas concentrations. Smoke layer height, that was one that surprised me the most. For smoke layer height, we had a combined value of 75% of participants who said that smoke layer height is very often or almost every time used in their analysis, which is kind of surprising to me because I personally would focus on visibility and temperatures rather than heights. How is it for you, Gabriel, in Spanish engineering? Well, I think there is a global misunderstanding on the small-scale height. First of all, because it does exist, and in all the large flight tests that we performed, I saw that existing. But how is that used? all the large fire tests that they performed, I saw that existing, right? But how is that used? Because normally it's just an interpretation of, you know, you have the smoke above your head and that's done, okay? So you design the smoke control system based on that. When I published my first work, and I remember that perfectly, that. When I published my first work, and I remember that perfectly, it was 2012 in Hong Kong, okay, in the SFP performance-based conference, and I discussed the difference approach to plume and tremor correlation, so the Thomas, Zukoski, McCaffrey, and Heskett plumes. Why I did that? Because you're not estimating what happened at your height, okay, head height. You're just assuming that the smoke is at a certain height into the enclosure, okay? And that's how you simplify all the issue, just saying, look, I want the smoke layer at 2.5 meters. Okay, excellent. Okay, and then you use this very simplified formula to get this smoke layer at a certain height. So I think we have a bit of a problem there. And also, if you do a CFD, so if you run a transient simulation with tons of CPU hours, okay, simulation with tons of CPU hours, to show that the smoke layers stand at 3 meters or some meters above the floor is not probably the case. Because you want to really understand what is happening in your enclosure at a certain time when you are passing through the smoke. I think you're touching a very important thing here that in plume correlations where you would calculate the mass flow of the smoke into a smoke layer, there is this magical parameter of the smoke layer height in almost every single model that you can use for plume calculations. This is sometimes considered to be the smoke layer height that you can use for plume calculations. This is sometimes considered to be the smoke layer height that you expect, but in fact it's not. It's just the length of the part of the plume at which the entrainment happens and that does not necessarily correlate to the smoke layer height that you will end up in a steady state analysis. And you've done that in your paper about, about smoke plumes where you've integrated these calculations over time and, and shown how the simple plume models can be used to determine this, this parameter over time. Right. And it, it was magical that they actually, that they actually met what was measured in many experiments, not just one. I found that fascinating because it's like, how much time does it take to simulate that huge atrium that you used for your experiment? That must be days to run Murcia properly. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. We have so many cases. And to be honest, I haven't published all the work I've done with zone models as well, because I run with CFAST, Ozone, Branch Fire, and Brisk, all the scenarios. But because the premature correlation were there, so I simplified the concept again to get an answer instead of to have a published paper. In a way, calculating a smoke layer height is fascinating. Yet, if you consider running CFD analysis, for me, it's kind of the concept. It doesn't click for me because I want the smoke to not be where my humans are, and I want the margin of safety above the heads of participants, but that would be project-based. I would not evaluate just the height of the layers. But I agree. You mentioned that authorities may require that or firefighters may want that, or you want to be in alignment with the standard that requires that. So I assume that that must be the case. And sometimes you just need to show that because they want that answer. Because, for example, in a fire dynamic simulator, FTS, you have the capability to get the smoke layer height. But that is based on temperature and it's not that accurate. If you see the result from FTS of the smoke layer, that is like a sort of laser beam, and you measure the smoke layer based on temperature and other coefficient, it doesn't correspond to what you see, for example, if you show a slice file with visibility. Yeah, and I think in one of your papers I've also read that integration approach for the layer height can make a difference of meters in terms of the evaluated height depending if you take like 30% or 10% of the of the of the smoke concentration or temperature as the end of your layer and It's it's I mean, it's it's very rarely a very sharp condition. There must be a gradient not not a sharp line And that it depends a lot of the suit yield of Very rarely a very sharp condition. There must be a gradient, not a sharp line. Exactly. And that depends a lot on the suit yield of the smoke. If you see the results, well, the picture of the test we performed in ITB, that was methanol, heptane, toluene, and propane, probably. Oh, man, we're not allowed to burn toluene in the lab after that one anymore. The toluene was incredible. So you can see that the most sooty is the smoke, the less gradient you have. Yeah, that's true. We've seen that. To continue on the survey, a lot of people are very interested. We had 250 people answering the questions, so I assume all of them are interested in the outcomes. The second important question we asked is, how often do you take engineering decisions based on condition? So it's not only if you use that, but how often that condition changes the outcomes of your design. And for me here, the only consistent one really is visibility in smoke. Because we had 89% of people saying they use visibility in smoke, and we have 89% people mentioning that they take decisions based on this criterion. So it's very consistent. For example, for temperature, it's slightly skewed because we have 76% people saying they use it, but just 45% doing design choices based on that temperature. Does this shock you? Not at all. You should probably define this better, engineering choice. We are talking about what is the criteria that define your ace of time okay that's the most important thing so you have like a car park you have a spread of smoke for a fire right okay so what is the first criteria okay criteria, okay, that appear there and say conditional are untenable. Okay? So it didn't surprise me at all that the most used tenability criteria in the definition, that is visibility and temperature, appear here in the most used one in determining the ASET time. And also, I think we can combine visibility with mass concentration of smoke. Yeah, we will do that when processing the survey results properly, because it's a lot of data that needs to be scientifically processed, and we will do that, definitely. Here it's just a quick look, because we are so excited with the results. I mean, we had 250 colleagues share their opinion with us, and that makes us very happy. Sorry, the other ones were smoke concentration of smoke, which defined acid in 40% of cases. And I also saw the smoke layer height was actually quite high because it was like 60% of the cases. And I also saw the smoke layer height was actually quite high because it was like 60% of the cases. And the other ones, other conditions like radiant heat flux, toxic gases, they were usually below 25%. So less than 25% engineers say this criterion is very impactful for the asset analysis. Just one thing, Wojciech. I think this is absolutely consistent with the science. Of course, we didn't mention here if the building is an airport, a tunnel, a small room, or if we look into fire intervention or evacuation. Well, it's mostly evacuation because it's at ARCET. But when it's mostly evacuation because it's at ARSAT. But when it happened to me, for example, I remember that in Riyadh, I did some analysis, for one of the biggest stations of the metro there. And the authority asked us to measure, to provide as a result, radioactivity, heat flux, CO concentration, and what more? We are very often asked for oxygen concentration. Oxygen concentration as well, etc., etc. Okay. So, at the end, we did provide that, but it was absolutely useless. Because if you have your visibility at like 10 meters, for example, most of the toxic gases, we're talking again about a normal enclosure with cellulosic plastic fire, something that we normally deal with. And when you have a visibility of 10 meters, normally all the toxic gases are far down in the limit and the concentration. And the same thing happens, for example, in the radiation, because radiation is a temperature to the time of fall. So, when your temperature is so low, your radiation consequently is low, unless you are very close to the fire. And the emissivity of the smoke will depend on the optical thickness of the smoke layer, which again is the same thing as the visibility. So, if you have very thick, optically very thick smoke, it means there was a lot of soot around, and if there was a lot of soot around and if there was a lot of soot around, you have most likely failed your visibility before you've reached this temperature and critical emissivity to break the radiative heat flux. So, it all aligns. I mean, for this, I'm very happy because these things, when we discuss this as two people with experience in that and then we can call ourselves researchers, it is in a way obvious to us. But then again, you have a junior engineer who will face a project in Riyadh, and the authorities will ask him for this, and they will not be able to tell that it's pointless to do that. Let's focus on the important things and important design choices. No, they will waste one or two days processing meaningless data just to show the accurate number of colorful plots to the AHA. And that's one thing. The good thing is that a union engineer is there to learn. A fire authority should be there to teach. So probably there are plenty of fire authorities there that should put themselves like a union engineer and learn more. Yeah. I hope that many of them will listen to this podcast. Yeah, I hope that many of them will listen to this podcast, and I hope this will be a very nice and easy way to improve your qualifications and learn something new. To round up the survey, I mean, the survey had a lot more questions like, how do you represent your outcomes? What height do you measure them? These are all very interesting, but I just cannot go over the visibility factor. The scattering the visibility factor question is just amazing. First, Gabriel, can you bring us to the point? What is the visibility factor? Yeah, well, we recently published a post in LinkedIn because it was the easiest way to reach engineers on that. So basically, the visibility estimated in CFD calculation, the one that we mostly use, is very simple. So the visibility is this visibility factor divided by the lightest station coefficient. Okay, this visibility factor has plenty of coefficient inside that everything comes from the bogger on the beer equation or beer number or just beer. So the simplification is there. So you have this special number that is the feasibility factor that is normally used in the engineering basic world is divided into reflecting sign that is equal to three and emitting sign that is 8. And that's pretty much it. It's far more complicated because there are plenty of coefficients into that coefficient. But, you know, as an empirical coefficient, it's just a number. And the result on the survey is quite interesting. Yeah. We had 34% people say they use value of 3 for like the reflecting signs, and 10% say they use value 8, which means there is just 44% of people using the values 3 or 8, as I would personally usually do pick one of them there's a great uh group of people saying they 30 31 percent they choose individual value of the c factor um on based on the project requirements and there's a good group of people like 10 of the participants who who use values from within a range. Because in the original paper in Japanese from 1970 by Jin, this value was actually determined as linearly correlated with the background brightness and contrast. So there's a possibility to use a range of these factors. So, yeah, what surprised me is that I thought that we would have, like, half of the survey participants choosing three, half choosing eight, and just a few percent saying they do otherwise. And I'm quite surprised. And actually, that's pretty cool because it means people try to learn and really use these advanced methods as they were conceived because it's engineering. Yeah, I hope. I hope so because if not, we have trouble. Oh, yeah. For that side, it could be kind of bad. And to be honest, in my point of view, people are using that, well, so-and-so. This article that we published together raised the problem of understanding. Because if you use 3 or 8, then are you able to understand the results of your CFD model. If you use light aid, for example, for emitting sign, so you see the smoke layer through the visibility, you might be particularly wrong and under-consolidated. I personally do my judgment based on mass concentration of smoke. I'm in the minority that does not really use visibility as visibility i i have to translate my uh my engineering into visibility because of peer pressure to explain this concept to to firefighters or someone else i usually have to use visibility in smoke but the engineering judgment is usually based on the critical value of mass density of smoke, which was devised actually by the Jeans correlation and specific mass extinction coefficient of Mulholland. And we just calculated what's the mass corresponding to the 10-meter visibility for light-emitting science for C-factor VIII. So in a way, it's hidden in there, but I rather prefer working with mass smoke densities because that's what the solver solves for. I mean, the physics of smoke is there, not physics of visibility. And that's why I prefer that. Past, you've actually touched that scientifically, the sensitivity of CED analysis to these factors. Actually, that's where we met in Copenhagen, I think it was. Yeah, where everything started with you, the academic relationship. So, yeah, basically, I was supervisor to Michael Alonso that did his master thesis here in Madrid. And the aim of the thesis was to play a bit with the input on the FDS analysis to get an understanding of what a change in the input would determine a change in the output. So we run, like, a few cases based on the Moussa atrium. We make a matrix changing the mass station coefficient, the C factor, and the suit yield. And actually, between the range of applicability, okay, so using a value of 3 and 8, all the visibility factor, and mass distinction coefficient between, I think, 7.6K to 8.7k, a range between that. And the visibility between 0.01 up to 0.2, I guess, we came out with the visibility itself as an output. And actually the results were quite interesting. I remember that research because I was sitting there, I was watching and when I saw that, I came to the realization that you've modeled that with a computer, with a CFD code, and I figured out I have a lab that we can model that. And you know what? It was a coincidence. A few weeks before this conference, we have hosted a group of politicians, of Polish politicians in the lab. And we were asked to do some nice presentation for them, what we're doing at ATV. So we figured, okay, let's do a fire in the ISO chamber. And we did the fire at the ISO chamber. And during this presentation, I realized that for the mass of fuel that we have used at the turned off ventilation of the chamber because we wanted to show them a very nice layer of smoke we we came to realization that we've reached a pretty decent steady state on the smoke layer and because our apparatus to measure the extinction coefficient of the smoke layer was running, we saw it just flatted out. So by accident, we have turned a transient problem of the evolution of visibility into a steady-state problem of having a stable layer of the gas in our lab. And I just liked that. But then a few weeks later, I'm at your talk, and it immediately caught my attention. Okay, we can actually do this in the lab and turn this problem into something researchable. Just let's use fuels with different suit yields, and then we can measure how big the scatter is from an experiment not the simulation and that that's what that's what it did with with uh experiments with methane methane methanol sorry ethanol propanol and entylene and yeah the outcome outcome was interesting because we have uh we have found that we can call it the magic number, but there is this point above which it barely matters if you change the suit yield and below it, it matters a lot. That was 0.1 gram per gram, by the way. We define that as a cutoff point. It is not actually a cutoff point because you have this hyperbolic behavior that is obvious based on the formula of the visibility. But the interesting thing is that you have the formula, so researchers can play with that fantastically. But then, as engineers, we have values to put into that formula. And normally, as fire safety engineers, we play in the range of 0 to 0.1, or 0.2 actually. That's the range when we move into. So if you have, for example, pine wood, you can have like 0.03 or 0.04. It's quite difficult to measure that soot yield. So it's not straightforward. It depends if you are overventilated, well-ventilated. It's quite difficult to measure that. But anyhow, it is quite clear that changing from 0.1 to 0.2 or 0.3 is not changing almost anything. Because you are on the right side of hyperbolic trend. But if you are playing between 0 and 0.1, well, your result can change dramatically. Probably still in FDS5, but definitely in FDS-4, the default reaction was propane, with a soil tilt of 0.01 gram per gram. So if you see where 0.01 is there in the graph, it's a massive change if you use 0.01 or 0.1. Yeah, exactly. It's also difficult to get scientifically accurate number, as you mentioned. It's difficult to measure that. But you also do not have homogeneous materials. We have very complex materials and mixes of materials. So you'd have to estimate this value for your whole mix. And then to add complexity on top of that, you also should include the efficiency of the combustion. So the ventilation conditions at which your fire occurs, because I mean, if we measure that on a simple device, like a count calorimeter, these are like fairly small samples in the very well ventilated spaces. But in reality, in fires, you'll have smoke generated in a very complex turbulent combustion, non-premixed, and that will lead to a completely different efficiency of combustion. And with the worst efficiency of combustion, the more products that can create soot will be produced. So this number is probably impossible to reach a value that would describe everything from a physics point of view. And we did that backwards from the user point of view, like what would be the value that would be still reasonable. So between 0.01 and 0.02, and yet leads to the least user error while doing that, if you do not have a better scientifically sound value. And this value of 0.1 gram per gram was this kind of magical value. If you use the larger number, there would be barely any difference in your analysis. you use the larger number, there would be barely any difference in your analysis. If you use lesser value, your impact is considerable on the outcomes, on the results of your study. So we figured out, let's give engineers 0.1. It's easy, simple to remember and give safe results. And if someone is competent enough to play with suit yield. And explain the choice of a different value. Or find a proof of a different value. They can do it regardless. And probably will do that. Yeah, also. One of the outcomes of this is. Do you know what you have into that space? Do you know what is actually burning? Because if I do uh like a paper storage okay so i can use paper of course that makes sense okay so cellulosing material that will be like 0.05 i don't know okay and that's fine but and if i have like uh plastic or you know know, I know what I have inside. I put what I have inside. But if I don't know, if I have a mixture of everything, so be careful. Yeah, and, you know, it's also a trap because if you say you store a paper or you have a shop that sells paper, like books or something, and your assumption of a very low suitability could be justified. And the next day, someone pulls an armchair inside filled with polyurethane foam, and they will not consider, is this fuel representative for the CFD analysis that were used to design the smoke control system of that building, because they absolutely have no idea about, I mean, it's safer to use this safe value because it covers problems like that. Because even if you use 0.1 and someone puts an armchair that would generate, let's say, 0.17 or something for very heavy polyurethane foams, it doesn't make a huge difference for the outcome of your analysis. It would change your available safe evacuation time by two or three seconds, which means you have not done a major mistake estimating that at the first place. So, yeah, I think this was, I mean, I'm very proud of that study. I know it's been cited a lot, and I've met many people who are using our value and were very happy with the fact that someone has published that and gave it to them. So I think that was a great piece of work. A final thing, 0.1 gram per gram corresponds to a normal plastic. Okay, so it's not like a magic number. No, it corresponds to something that exists and makes sense to us. Yeah, I mean, this research was pretty interesting. I wanted to share with you one last final item on this itinerary. We've also recently done a very interesting research on wavelength sensitivity of visibility in smoke, and I was wondering if that ever caught your attention. Basically, when you consider the smoke from a science point of view, it's a bunch of particles hanging in the air and these particles will have different sizes, shapes. Actually, you can most likely distinguish what was burning from just knowing what is the distribution of particles in your smoke. And because these particles will have different optical properties related to their size, you will end up with absorbing or scattering different bands of the visible light in a different manner on the same smoke. So we know that the blue light will be the most absorbed in the fire smoke, while the red one will pass it the easiest. So, I mean, we knew that there's going to be a difference between them. In our engineering, we usually use just the generic concept of white light and one value of specific mass extinction coefficient for everything. We never go into wavelength sensitivity. However, we did that experimentally. We've built a device that measures light extinction coefficient in different wavelengths. It's just a bunch of different colored lasers that are separate from each other, and they just measure the extinction simultaneously. And what we ended up with is a scatter of visibility in smoke from one single source of heptane from 10 meters or even less, seven meters for the blue light, while you get something like 15 meters for the far end spectrum of the red light. So almost a factor of two difference in the visibility measured by that. a factor of two difference in in the visibility measured by that i was wondering if it ever caught your attention in in like professional uh analysis or or is it something yet exotic for for this community well definitely yet exotic for for this community and i can tell you and i think uh you're doing a great job in mixing this fire fire approach to what is called spectral photometry. That is another sort of science that needs to be mixed to understand what is actually happening when evaluating visibility through smoke. Because we are really relying on a very simple equation that, well, according to my study, the first equation of Bobby Lambert Beard was discovered by Pierre Bogert in 1729. Okay. So, we are talking about something that has a lot of history, okay? And we are still sticking to that. And I think what you're doing is a great job in getting this updated and improved. You know, the funny part is that what I'm touching in here with my research is something that Gene has already mentioned in like third paper in the 70s. It just never went into mainstream because he already recognized that the light will be consumed by the smoke in different manner for different wavelengths. So it's something that has been there always. It's just it was probably omitted for simplicity. I mean, this theory was never deceived for CFD. It was built for simple analysis where you have a homogeneous smoke in one huge room and you want to estimate what would be the visibility in that room, not for someone using that 50 years later with very advanced numerical models, right? Yeah, exactly, exactly. years later with very advanced numerical models, right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You know, we are considering the light that comes into this piece of something that has this particular particles inside and then get out of that. Okay? And we measure how much light is staying there or getting out, absorbed or, okay. But we are not actually considering that well what is happening into that box. Okay, Gabriel, I'm mindful of your time and I know you have a very busy schedule and I'm very thankful that you found a spot for me in it. It was great chatting with you and even greater to do the research with you. And this is not the last word we've placed on visibility in smoke. I'm sure everyone enjoyed this long chat on the tenability criteria and visibility in smoke. So, yeah, man, thank you. Thank you so much for being here and see you around, man. Thank you very much, Bocek. That was fantastic. I'm sure this podcast will be a success. So thanks for inviting me. Yep, that's it. I told you it's going to be great. I really enjoyed talking to Gabriele and it's always fun to recap our previous studies together. It's been so many years we've been researching this topic together, and every now and then it's fun to chat about it. I hope you enjoyed it a lot. I think Gabriele is a fantastic engineer, and it's worth staying in touch with him. So if you would like to do that, Gabriele is very active on Twitter with his handle at Vigne underscore gabriella that is v-i-g-n-e underscore gabriella and his company jvva is also very active and probably he's most active on linkedin so you want to follow him there And if you meet him on a conference, make sure you go for a beer with him. And he also, besides visibility in spoke, can tell you some quite interesting rock and roll stories from a different career, which is absolutely worth it. I highly recommend doing that. Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed this episode. And that's it for the first week of the podcast. that. Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed this episode and that's it for the first week of the podcast. I'm more than happy to finally share this content with you and there's going to be so much more coming in in the next weeks. So yeah, look up to the north every Wednesday morning because there will be a new podcast episode waiting for you starting next week with Dr. Matthew Bonner on facades and then so many interesting guests and topics. I'm sure you will enjoy them a lot. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on your favorite podcast app. Make sure you sign up to the newsletter and as always I'll drop all the links to the papers and interesting things that were mentioned in the episode in the show notes. So make sure you check them out. And yeah, go on with your research on penability criteria and visibility in smoke. Oh, and look forward to the paper from the survey. I hope we can manage writing it before September or something. I think that's the goal. I hope we meet that. Once the paper is ready and the data is scientifically worked out, I'm sure I'm going to bring more people into the podcast. I'm going to bring Lucas and Wolfram and Gabriela once again, and then we'll give a proper scientific discussion on the results of the survey. For now, thank you very much for being here, and I really appreciate you, and yeah, see you around. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
