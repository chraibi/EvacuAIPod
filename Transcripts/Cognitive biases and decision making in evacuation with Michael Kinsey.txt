 So it's time for another thought experiment. Imagine you're in a supermarket with a cart full of groceries, approaching the cashier's desk and you hear a fire alarm. What do you do? Do you run for your life or kindly ignore that message? Probably the second one. But now imagine you see some person. As soon as they hear the alarm, they drop everything and start to run. What do you do now? Probably the outcome is kind of different because you at least question if you should run. And what if that person was your boss or maybe the smartest guy in your office? Would that influence your decision? Probably yes. And now what route do you take? How do you escape that building? Do you go through the nearest exit, that backside of the shop, or maybe try and escape through the entrance of the shop that you've entered with? Or let's imagine a different situation. For many years, you go to the same office, which has five staircases, and you always take the same one. And now there's a file alarm. What are the chances you're going to take a different one? All these things that impact our decisions during the evacuation, the important decisions, if we want to run, if we start evacuating, if we inform others, which route do we choose, how do we escape? All of these things are impacted by things called biases and heuristics, mind shortcuts for taking decisions on the fly with your intuition, not with your conscious thinking. And this is the thing I want to talk today with Dr. Mike Kinsey from Arup in China. Mike has a long experience in researching the cognitive biases and their impact on decision-making processes in evacuation. And he also tried to move that into the field of evacuation modeling and also to the engineering practices, how biases impact the way how we design safety systems. And all of these things are what we're going to discuss in today's episode. And all of these things are what we're going to discuss into today's episode. The idea for the episode came from a paper of Mike, in which he and his team investigated multiple different cognitive biases that can occur in the evacuation process. And to know them all, to list them, I must refer you to the paper. You're not going to find it out in this episode. It would be just too long and possibly maybe even boring to just hear one after another. However, we picked some of the most impactful of them and discussed them in depth in here. The focus of the episode is not on what the particular biases are, but why these biases matter? How should we be aware of these biases existing and how do they interfere with the evacuation process and in a way with our modeling? And I think that's a powerful thing to learn that such things as cognitive biases exist and they have such a tremendous impact on the evacuation process. So I hope I've built your expectations high because this is a really good one. I hope you enjoy it and yeah, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host. Hello and welcome, everybody. Today I'm here with Dr. Mike Kinsey, who's with Arup in China. Mike is an expert on evacuation and pedestrian dynamics and decision making. So I'm really happy to finally have a guest from this part of the fire science. Hi, Mike. Hi, how's it going? Hey, thanks, man. I'm great. I get to get used to this time differences, having podcast guests from all over the world. However, it's very exciting. Mike, I brought you here because one of your research subjects was really interesting to me, and I found it absolutely fascinating to think in a way that you have presented in your papers. And I mean your research on cognitive biases in decision-making processes, in the evacuation process. But not only that, because you also expand that to fire science and engineering. So to give a background to the listeners, the work of Mike comes from a field that we can call behavioral economics, which investigates biases, heuristics, and decision making processes. And Mike actually has taken the research from this field and adopted it to decision making processes within the evacuation processes to understand how people take these decisions based on these biases and heuristics during the evacuation process. And yeah, I find it really astounding to look at this from this kind of perspective. So Mike, what made you pursue this research? What was the â€“ how did it start, actually? Yeah, so I think the idea came about through being recommended a book to read by Daniel Kahneman, Thinking Fast and Slow, who's a psychologist, but he's won a Nobel Prize in behavioral economics. He's the grandfather of behavioral economics. And after reading it, I thought, well, this is really fascinating. I think we could apply this to fire evacuations. This team comprised of Professor Steve Gwynn at Movement Strategies in the UK, Dr. Max Keneteda at the NRC in Canada, and Dr. Erica Kuligowski, who was at NIST, who's now at RMIT. And we decided, how can we, we looked at this and we thought, well, this is a really interesting subject. And if people can make biases in all manner of fields of their lives, then they can make biases during fire evacuations. And that's what got us started looking at this topic. Yeah, when doing the podcast, I meet people who take different research items from all over the world of science and implement it in fire science and technology. And that's usually where the greatest ideas are born. So I'm really happy that you've taken the behavioral economics and implemented that in analyzing the decision-making processes. And when you consider evacuation, it's obvious that the movement of people will be driven by the decisions they take and the route they choose, the exits they choose. So absolutely, the movement will be impacted by the decision-making process. Trained as fire safety engineers, you learn that there is this pre-movement time, there's the movement time, and both are as important in the evacuation processes and both will impact the overall time to exit the building. So this decision-making process will have a tremendous impact over the whole evacuation time required for the building. Is that a few that you share? Yeah, I think if we contextualize this as a bit of a problem, and when we look at decision-making, looking at the evacuation process is probably one of the most complicated things we can do in fire engineering, because it's not something we can easily measure. It's very hard to measure certain aspects of why people make decisions. You can ask them, but quite often they won't know why they make a certain decision. What compounds the issue is sometimes people think they do know why, but actually they don't. And one of the reasons is that, as we've highlighted, you know, based on Daniel Kahneman's work, your brain functions of if employing two independent but collaborative types of thinking, that's the system one, automatic system, which happens in the subconscious or the non-conscious. And we use that all the time. And then when we need to focus on something, we use the reflective system, which we're aware of. But that takes a lot more effort. So we naturally prefer to operate in this almost automatic mode. So quite often, we don't know why we make certain decisions. And that can make it a really challenging subject to look at decision making. Yeah, and I think the decisions are the hard part, actually, of the modeling. In my practical engineering, I certainly omit the decision making process by using the pre-evacuation time distributions. And I guess that's the way how most of the fire safety engineers would deal with. most of the fire safety engineers would deal with. And when you think about it from the perspective of individual decisions, I mean, the individual decisions will be also driven by the personal experiences of people. And, for example, if you have a person in your building that has survived a fire in their life, they will act in a completely different manner from people who never experienced fire and can evacuate very, very quickly or can take some very different decisions. And this definitely does not fit into my ideal 60 to 180 second distribution of pre-evacuation time that I would be using. I would be using. So, in fact, if we could use these decision-making processes and implement them in the pre-evacuation modeling, we could actually do pre-evacuation modeling instead of just simple distributions. That could be a whole new level of evacuation modeling, in fact. a whole new level of evacuation modeling, in fact. And today, what we're using is something very clever and very easy, because the pre-evacuation distributions are kind of like design fires or temperature time curves that are standardized. But maybe in the future, when we move into individual decision-making processes and these aspects, our modeling could be closer to reality. What's your take on that? Are we ready for decision-making modeling in pre-evacuation times? Yeah, absolutely. So a few things, I guess, to say about this. When we model human behavior, it's quite a bit different to say modeling a physical-based system. Most of our models, say in fire engineering, CFD, structural fire engineering models, they're physics-based models, and they're based on physics-based reasoning, which we typically have quite a good idea of certain values because we've done experiments and we know perhaps what we don't know. So known unknowns. With human behavior, our known unknowns is much bigger and we also have unknown unknowns. There's things that we perhaps can't know prior to doing our evacuation model. We can't know the exact number of people that are going to be in a building for a specific fire. We can't know their past experience up until a certain point when the fire evacuation starts. So we have much bigger variation when we're considering evacuations. And then there are kind of, even if we have a complete understanding of human behavior and all the influence of decision making, there's always going to be this fairly sizable margin of variation. So what that what that creates is an onus on the fire engineer to consider reasonable ranges of behavior so that we can do things like sensitivity testing and thinking about conservatism and saying, well, if we were if we do in a model for the worst case, does it work? And we try and factor in and consider uncertainty through sensitivity testing or conservatism. It's not necessary about when we run an evacuation model. We're not saying this is exactly what's going to happen for a specific fire. We're saying this is what could happen. And we've done all these other scenarios saying this is also what could happen under different scenarios. So that's how we kind of, we need to manage uncertainty in that way. Oh, yeah, that's so good. That's so good. And do you think it will be possible to have, let's say, decision-making avatar in the computer model that, based on this, let's say, ranges of experiences or ranges of outcomes of decision-making, could take decisions on the fly, and we could actually track that in a simulation model. So in the end, we could run, like, thousands of simulations with different decisions being taken in each of them to figure out not only the ranges of the evacuation times, but to identify the extreme scenarios in which some extreme decisions were taken. And maybe these scenarios would be the most interesting ones to ask fire engineers because this would be the scenarios that we could actually act on to minimize the risks in the building. I'm wondering if it's already possible or maybe it will be possible in the near future. I'm not sure of the current state of development and evacuation models, but I'm pretty sure you know. Yeah, so I would say that all evacuation models represent decision making in some way. It's just the level of explicit representation it has in things that influence it. So it's, you know, right from your hand calculations to your computational evacuation models, all of them represent some level of decision making, which are based on some assumptions. Now, the real catch is how well does it do that? How well does it capture what is actually going to happen? And how much confidence can we derive from these models? Now, one issue I'd say is, first of all, evacuation models are producing one result when they run a scenario, but actually you could have different results because you may have different underlying conditions. It's possible that you could get an evacuation model to just keep running lots and lots to brute force all your probability distributions. Now, for statistical purposes, that would produce, you know, a nice spread of data and it might give you lots of very good statistical precision. But actually, you might find that the underlying evacuation dynamics don't actually change very much. So I think it's important when we think about evacuation models and using statistical distributions to represent our uncertainty with decision making. We have to think about what's actually happening in a simulation and not just focus on statistical precision variability. I think we are getting better at modeling different decisions. Most evacuation models are based on some kind of shortest time path route selection. And I think the issue we're going to come up against is that evacuation model developers need to develop the functionality within their models to represent other types of route selection and decision making. For example, movement towards the familiar. Most evacuation models have this capability, but then we need data to support, well, how do we decide which exit is likely to be more familiar and to what extent? So I think we need a bit of more research in this area and development of not just collection of data for specific buildings, but developing generalized principles so that fire engineers know what data they can put into the model. From a practitioner's perspective, I think you've touched a critical aspect that every model has some sort of decision-making processes built within it, and they're usually related to the route selection. And that will be true even if you calculate your evacuation time on a piece of paper because you had to figure out what path the occupants will take to calculate the time they need to go through that. So in computer modeling, in computational evacuation modeling, and when you model these processes, when you model evacuation of people in buildings, sometimes these models for decision making, for route selection are sometimes very annoying because they will force people to go to the shortest path. And that's not necessarily the one that you would pick if you were exiting the building. So sometimes you have to really play a lot with these models to get a resulting distribution that resembles something that looks real. And, yeah, it's difficult to tell what is real, what's the correct outcome. But sometimes it's just obvious that the shortest path, the route selection was just incorrect. And you can fix that by using familiarity concepts like you mentioned. And you can fix that by using familiarity concepts like you mentioned. The way that they are implemented in the current software, they take a lot of effort from the modeler to actually play with them to receive a feasible outcome. These models are either probability distribution functions for knowledge about a certain exit or distribution of what would an agent prefer, and then just randomly chooses the exit from the list of known exits to that agent. And I know there are models that also use some sort of local familiarity maps or local preference maps where the agent decides as they enter the compartment, which they will pursue through that compartment without maybe knowing the path behind that compartment. So that's another take. However complex these models would be, they are usually relating the decisions to the movement of people. And if you take a look at videos of evacuations and fires, there's plenty of actions that people take without movement or before they start moving. And, yeah, as an engineer, these decisions could seem irrational. But if I think about myself in a fire in a shopping mall or something, I would probably also take my phone and start a video incident instead of running for my life. So when you think about yourself, it is stopping that irrational. I was wondering if this type of behavior, like non-movement actions that people take before they start evacuating, is this something that we also should include in the modeling or is it something that we can just comfortably hide within the pre-evacuation time distributions and safety margins and not worry about that at all? I think there are two parts to this. One is evacuation models are highly, highly sensitive to user inputs and user configuration. So we should never say that an evacuation model told me this. It's very much the evacuation model user and the model together coming up with an answer, and the user has to interpret what that means. Now, that means that there's an increased reliance on the user for their competency and their understanding in human behavior, and indeed, their understanding to recognize what the model is telling them is perhaps not what is likely to happen. So that's an important aspect, I think. And actually what you've touched on there, I think, is one of the motivations we wanted to look at biases, because we wanted to look at why do people make mistakes or perhaps behave in a suboptimal behavior? We generally know that people generally behave quite rationally during fire evacuations. We generally know that people generally behave quite rationally during fire evacuations. It's just that the observer to a given behavior may not be fully aware of all the aspects of their decision making that are influencing it. So, for example, in the World Trade Center 9-11 attacks, a number of people jumped out the windows to their deaths. And a lot of people thought that was either an example of panic or irrational behavior. But if you put that in the context of they might have the prospect of being burnt alive at very high temperature fires, it seems slightly less irrational, shall we say. So quite often when people label things as being irrational, it's often a reflection of the ignorance of the observer rather than actually being something which is not logical. Talking about irrational decisions, one of my colleagues shared his experience from an evacuation drill. And in the drill, they had a woman who jumped out of a window on the first floor of the building during the drill. And it seems a very, very irrational decision. But actually, the woman had a traumatic history of fire in her life, and she was absolutely traumatized by the fact that she may be in a building that has a fire in it. So, she'd taken the decision on the fly and escaped with the first exit to the outside that she saw. And when you consider everything, her experience, the potential consequences of a fire and whatever she went through, and this decision stops being such a rational. And I think that may be the case of many decisions being taken during the evacuation processes that we may not be aware of the underlying conditions that cause them. And as you said, it's the ignorance with the observer. And the other thing to consider when you do evacuation modeling, you see these realistic avatars walking around the building, giving the impression that it's truly the human behavior being modeled. Well, in fact, it's just the movement process. And when you are in the fire, when you would have to evacuate in the fact it's just the movement process and when you are in the fire when you would be when you would have to evacuate in the fire there will be a lot of things that would matter to your ability to escape including your experience your training maybe your preferences on how would you like to escape or maybe tasks that you have to complete before evacuating. So it's definitely way, way more complex than just calculating and modeling the movement of people, which I think would be fairly easy. And in the end, it's very hard to capture this complex process into a single value of required safe evacuation time, which arguably you have to do as a fire safety engineer, because that's the most used way to quantify safety. Yeah, I think you've touched on a few points there. One is about a visual realism of avatars. So one of the things we did was as well as look at biases during fire evacuations, we decided to apply it to fire engineering as a discipline and say what biases fire engineers might exhibit. And then we extended that even further to looking at evacuation model biases where we actually collected data. We actually identified that there are a number, there's a sizable proportion of fire engineers that believe that because the avatars look realistic, the underlying behavioral model is realistic, which is a bit worrying. The underlying behavioral model is realistic, which is a bit worrying because we certainly know that evacuation models can look super realistic. But perhaps their models, the underlying behavioral models are less well validated. So I think we have to think about biases, not just what people might do during fire evacuations, but also within fire engineering as well oh wow you must be reading my mind or my notes because you've kind of segued me to the second part of the interview i wanted to touch about the biases engineering oh sorry no worries no worries but let's stay on on the human behavior still for for a few minutes so in the paper and as usual I will link the paper in the show notes for anyone who wants to find it. You've used a framework to structure the description of 15 cognitive biases that are relevant to the fire evacuation. And the framework is called PADM, Protective Action Decision Model Classification. decision model classification, and within it, you classify to which stage of the evacuation the bias is assigned to or to which combination of stages. And these are in pre-decision stage, the perception, attentiveness, or comprehension, and in decision-making stage, credibility, personalization, and action. Obviously, they are described in much more detail in the paper, so if anyone's interested, please read up on that. But I would like to hear from you. How did this framework work for you, and how did this PADM method help you distinguish the biases and actually structure them? Sure. So the protective action decision model was originally developed by Lindland Perry for more general purpose emergency incidents. And then Erica Kuligowski is one of the co-authors, developed that as part of her PhD thesis looking at how we could apply it to behavior during fire evacuations. It's largely focused, it doesn't have to be, but it's largely focused, a lot of the past work anyway, looking at the pre-evacuation phase, the way we receive cues, the way we interpret them, and then we decide what to do. And we thought this would be a really interesting framework to try and classify our behavior biases during fire evacuations because we wanted to see if there were one is how biases might be able to fit in with a broader theory of human behavior but also if there is there a way that we could see group certain biases together because whilst we've classified these biases within the paper, according to different types of example behavior, in reality, there's lots of overlap between some of these biases as well. So we wanted to try and it's a bit of a spaghetti of decision making. So we're trying to classify things to help make it easier for us to identify trends. Yeah, from this episode, I doubt that anyone will be able to directly implement the biases in their everyday engineering, but that was never the goal. I think the goal of this podcast is to have people understand the reasons of their modeling better and gain new insight on what is happening within their evacuation modeling. And I really hope the modelers will use that knowledge to interpret their results better. I hope that firefighters will understand better what's happening during the fire evacuations in buildings. And I hope maybe architects or designers could use the knowledge in here to shape the buildings in a way that promotes a good decision-making process in a fire evacuation. So from your paper, I've listed three biases that I would like to discuss. But first, maybe that's a silly question, but do you have a favorite bias or two that you would like to bring up? And then I'll let you know which three I've chosen. Yeah, absolutely. I think going back to what you first said before, I think we're trying to highlight that people might not behave in an optimal way. And I know that when we're doing hand calcs or evacuation models, there's a lot of assumptions which are quite optimal. So hopefully this is a poke in a direction to say, look, people might not behave in this amazing, you know, considered way. In terms of if I have any favorite biases, I would say some of them are quite interesting. I think biases provide a means to look at behavior which we already know exists, but in a different way. So, for example, we know we've known for a little while that people move towards the familiar. People will move towards a familiar exit. But some of these biases perhaps suggest why they do that. So one is that it's more salient in memory, and that comes down to something called availability bias. You're more likely to choose something which is more readily available in your mind. This is why marketing has adverts all over your city advertising products. It doesn't mean you're going to buy it, but you'll be more familiar with it. Therefore, you're more likely to consider buying it. So we can frame that as an availability bias. It will also be framed as something called default bias. Often we make a decision once, perhaps when we first encounter a situation, and then we stop making the decision. It happens by default. So it's a default bias. So when you go out your door of your office every day, you don't think about it. It just happens by default. So that forms a default bias. So some of some of them we've tried to identify new perhaps types of behavior that might be worth looking at. But also we've looked at ways of saying this is a new way you can look at the behavior we know exists already. Yeah, the default bias was also on top of my list. And I think it's very profound to everyday evacuation modeling and also to the way how engineers work. But that will touch in just a few minutes. So when you learn evacuation modeling, you are often being taught this concept of familiarity, that people will rather choose a familiar exit, preferably the one they have entered the building through. And previously in the talk, I've mentioned that sometimes I see people move in an incorrect way. And often this is manifested by people choosing some, let's say, obscure exits. Imagine you're being in the middle of a shopping mall and instead of choosing the main entrance to the mall, you would enter a shop and then a warehouse behind that shop and then exit to some narrow passage in the back door of that shop. So, of course, if one or two people do that, that could happen, but not the majority of people being in the mall. They would not choose this exit normally. And this, previously, when I saw this behavior, I've connected it with the familiarity of exits. So, when I saw this behavior, it seemed not natural because the people were unfamiliar with that exit. But now after this talk, I will look at this kind of behavior through the biases, the availability and default biases that people will lean towards choosing the default option. And that's the main exit. So as you mentioned, the biases are not only ways to take decisions, but are also means to understand the behavior we already knew and we already saw in our modeling. The other one that I wanted to discuss was the halo effect, which is related to how actions of one person influence the choices of the other people. And two evacuation experiments come to my mind. The first one was related to a road tunnel evacuation experiments. I don't recall the names of the authors, but I remember it was about tunnels in Brussels. And the other one is a study on evacuation of a cinema. I think that was done by Lovraglio and Ronchi. And both of these studies investigated multiple scenarios, and there was a certain scenario or scenarios in which the first person took the decision to evacuate fairly early in the study. And these scenarios were the ones with the shortest pre-evacuation time. So definitely the decision of the first person has heavily influenced the decision-making process of the others. And now I can look on that through the halo bias. Yes, so I think there's a few things there. We know that we have something called bandwagon bias where people, the surrounding population, if they start doing it, you're more likely to do something similar. The whole thing about also default effect is also if you ask someone to perhaps use a stair they've never used before, that presents an uncertain option. And people don't tend to want to choose uncertainty when they need to get out of a building. So there's a lot of I think what we've what we're trying to what we've tried to do here is list some of the potential biases and then we've given examples there may be other examples that they may these may occur also and i guess what we're hoping is that when decision fire evacuation decision research is conducted that people researchers might want to consider well how could i frame this in terms of a bias happening which hopefully could lead to some interesting things and the last one that has come to my mind was the planning fallacy, which is the tendency to underestimate the time necessary to finish a task. And in terms of evacuation, it could also be like when you have a person in a building, they may underestimate the time required to exit the building because they will be biased by the time that it takes to walk to the exit and then you just exit, right? But what people do not know and we modelers do know is that the evacuation time is often driven by the queue formation and the wait time at the exits because if there's too many people at one exit, the queue will form and not everyone can immediately use that door. So a person might severely underestimate the time necessary to get out from an exit. Or when you're in a tall building and you have never used the staircase, you may very, very severely underestimate the time necessary to walk down from a tall floor in your building. Absolutely. I think, I mean, I work on floor 37 here in Shanghai, and it takes me less than a minute to get to my floor using the lifts. Now, I know, because obviously my profession, I know it's going to take me a very long time to go down the stairs. But a lot of other people may think, well, it takes me only one and a half minutes. That might bias them to think they know they're going to take longer, but it might bias them to think of a lower number. So there might be an anchoring effect here of how long they expect to take to evacuate. Now, the issue might not the real challenge here might not be it takes them longer. It might actually mean that they take longer to decide to evacuate because they think, oh, I can get out the building quickly. So whilst certain biases might affect certain types of behavior, it can have a knock-on effect on other types of behavior. Yeah, exactly. That's what I meant. It's not that it will take longer to exit through that exit because there's a queue. I mean, we account for that. That's exactly what we model with our computational evacuation modeling, and that's what we're used to as the fire engineers. But as a user of the building, when they are unaware that a queue will form and it will have an increased time to exit the building through a door, they may delay the decision to evacuate, and that's something that could be potentially very dangerous. And the same goes for the evacuation through the staircases of high-rise buildings. People may just evacuate later because they think it does not take that much time to exit the building. And out of curiosity, have you ever taken the stairs? Did you try out how long it takes to evacuate? So every building or every high rise building used to do an evacuation drill every year. Now, by strange, absolute coincidence, I mean, I've been in Shanghai five and a half years now. I've never been in the building when they've done it. Total coincidence. I want I almost want I want to be here, but I've always been traveling or business or something else. I have walked down my apartment floor, which I'm on floor 20. I have done that. And that was late at night. I was the first one out. Luckily, I'd be a bit embarrassed if I wasn't. And that took a long time. I remember this one time when we were commissioning a high-rise building in Warsaw, and we ended up very, very late in the evening. Actually, it was something closer to the middle of the night. And because the lift was operated by an operator due to safety reasons, it was still a building under construction. So there was literally a driver of the lift who was pressing the floor buttons and had the key to start the elevator. The elevator was suddenly unavailable and we were stuck there at the 30th floor. So yeah, we had to walk down and as the pain in my legs spilled, I had more and more reflections on the difficulties of the evacuation processes of high-rise buildings. Absolutely. So in one of your talks, I had this aha moment when I listened to it. Many things that we discuss here is something that I'm already, let's say, familiar with, this System 1, System 2, and thinking and stuff like that. I've learned that from a different source. I mean, I read and enjoy Kahneman's books as well, but for me the source of knowledge in this field was the learning how to learn course on Coursera platform. And there's also a companion book called The Mind of Numbers by Barbara Oakley, which I highly recommend to anyone. Anyway, as this, let's say, biases and this way how decisions are taken was, let's say, something more close to me, more understandable by me. You've mentioned the concept of nudging, which is a way to push a person towards a certain decision in a way that the person may not be aware of. And that was the aha moment. And that was the aha moment. I mean, if we could use this knowledge and biases and knowledge how decisions are taken to actually influence how people take the decisions during an evacuation time in a way that could promote good decisions or optimal decisions in terms of the evacuation behavior, that's something we can work with that's that's a way to turn this let's say abstract discussion into tools and devices that could actually improve the evacuation process so so i find this really fascinating yeah so can can you please explain more about this concept of nudging sure so um following on from looking at biases, we then thought, well, how can we make people or increase the chance of people making better decisions during fire evacuations? And I think the paper doesn't go into too much detail, but we certainly talked about it amongst amongst the team. So the concept of nudge, just to define what these are, typically a nudge is a low cost method which increases the chances of someone making a given decision. It doesn't force someone to make a given decision where you just say you have to give them one exit, for example. It nudges them in a certain direction. So it maintains freedom of choice. So it maintains freedom of choice. So one way we could possibly do this is things like there's something called the theory of learned irrelevance. So when people use buildings, they don't need to use the emergency exits. They don't need to use emergency signage. So your brain learns to ignore this information that class is noise. I don't need to use that. I'll carry on. The problem is during a fire evacuation, someone might actually need to use an emergency exit, but their brain hasn't been keeping track of where they are. They've deliberately forgot them. So one thing we could think about doing is things like, and this type of thing, of course, requires studying. I'm not suggesting everyone goes out and designs this in their buildings. But an interesting area of research for nudges would be to look at things like dynamic signage during normal operation. So, for example, you have flashing lights which occasionally go off in the middle of the day or whatever. And that just catches someone's eye. They look and they go, oh, that's the emergency exit, and they carry on. There's been research looking at dynamic signs, flashing lights during fire evacuations. But if we can get people to take notice of these during normal usage, then when or if a fire evacuation does occur, this hopefully will nudge them into remembering where these are. That's an example. I think it's similar to the information boards in road tunnels where when you're driving, you see these light boards above the road that say, stick to the right lane or something. And actually, when something happens, the information is presented on them. So you actually recognize that the information would be there and you would seek information at them. And the same goes for evacuation signs. I mean, they convey the messages. However, in normal use, I think as you mentioned before in the talk, you get too familiar about them and your brain forgets that they are there they become the part of the background and well when you would be in a emergency mode and you would seek information you may actually find the information at them and you would seek them yeah the cool thing about being a fire engineer is that you know they will be there. If the building was built to a standard, it means it has a proper evacuation sign, even if your brain chooses to not pick the information when you're just walking by. I was also wondering if the concept of nudging could be used in, let's say, voice alarm or conveying the voice messages in in the building it was something that always intrigued me if there is any any best way to present information in the voice alarm that it's it's short it conveys the message and then it makes people really start evacuating i wonder if if it's something that you've researched or you know research about that? Yeah, absolutely. I think there's been a lot of research into human behavior and fire alarm messaging, which I think definitely could benefit from considering things like nudges and the biases. So, for example, we know that if someone were to say, we know that through authority bias, people are more likely to follow the instructions of someone in a position of authority. So that could be one thing to consider within the message, within alarm messaging. Yeah, definitely. That's a place to start. I also wonder if this same concept could be applied to something like dynamic signage to like use nudging to make people follow the dynamic signs more accurately. And actually, dynamic signage is a very fascinating field of evacuation. And I wonder if you have any first experience with that, or maybe you know someone who did and can comment on this aspect. maybe you know someone who did and can comment on these aspects? Yeah, so where I did my PhD at the University of Greenwich in the Fire Safety Engineering Group under Professor Ed Gallier, one of my colleagues, Dr. Xie Hui, his PhD was all about looking at signage and specifically looking at the impact of dynamic signage. I was lucky enough to help out with some of those drills, but I'd highly encourage anyone to have a look at that research. They're absolutely fascinating. And they looked at the impact of signage on non-disabled and disabled people as well, because people with visual impairments behave differently to those without. And one of the fascinating findings, if I remember correctly, was just on the base premise, something a very, very high proportion of people do not even notice the signs, emergency signage when they've been asked to evacuate. I think it was around the 70% mark. So that's just normal signage. So that's a huge number of people, a proportion of people, potentially ignoring the thing which, as designers, we're relying on to get them to a place of safety. So I feel very comfortable knowing that they will be there and the information will be there when I need it. However, if I was just a a person not a fire safety engineer and i didn't know that the evacuation science must be there or maybe forgotten about the fact that they are everywhere i maybe would not seek that information on the science which would prevent me from getting the information of which route to exit to pursue and uh yeah, you also mentioned that the flashing dynamic signage on the normal use could help people remember they are there, and that's definitely a way. I've asked you the question about the dynamic signage, because in Poland, in my country, this is a technological trend that comes to many new buildings because people like to use it to offset for some other, let's say, missing technologies in fire safety. In Poland, you can sometimes use countermeasures. If you cannot provide a certain feature of fire safety, you can maybe countermeasure it with other ones. And when it comes to dynamic signage, I'm often being asked if there really is an added value to that, if it really makes a difference between normal signage and dynamic one when it comes to an evacuation. But yeah, you've answered that already. And you did actually in the most preferred way in this podcast by listing a research item to read up on. And I will link it in the show notes. And I really appreciate it. My guests share the resources. And this becomes a reference point to seek new knowledge for the listeners. So yeah, I hope the listeners enjoy it as well. So now let's jump into the second part, which I've teased already at least twice, the biases in engineering. So in one of your talks, you've went beyond cognitive biases in evacuation. You've actually discussed the biases of engineering. So you've jumped from the evacuation into the way how evacuation is designed and investigated. What are the biases that influence the design? And I found it as interesting as the biases in the evacuation processes as well. Could you please tell us more about that? I know it also included a very, very interesting survey on the use of evacuation models. Yeah. So I think for me, it was a natural progression to say, well, we've looked at human behavior and biases in evacuations. What about fire engineers themselves? And part born out of my, I think what I could see happening perhaps in the wider field of fire engineering. I think, well, maybe we could apply the same principles to fire engineering. So we originally put together a paper and we came up with some biases. We then tried to classify the biases according to when they occurred. So we looked at biases which are associated with the use of fire codes or regulations, biases which occurred due to in modeling and calculations. We also looked at probabilistic risk assessments, biases in general engineering practice and then perceptions based on experience. That's how we kind of classified things. And this kind of after I mean, this is after we've done it. But we're also thinking this is forms an integral part of quite a hot topic in fire engineering at the moment, which is about competencies. How do we decide if a fire engineer is competent in some fashion? And we thought the biases are obviously ways you can potentially make mistakes. So this forms part of the competency discussion, as it were you mentioned that biases lead to mistakes but also in one of the talks you've said that some biases could lead to let's say a more safe outcome and an example was the use of conservative default values in software because the users tend to use the default values if they do not have better values of their own or they do not will to invest in researching better values for the particular design test they're doing. They rely to the default values and this would lead to a more conservative outcome of their simulation or analysis. And it may not correlate necessarily to more safety, but the outcomes will definitely be conservative so here's an example of how how biases can actually have a positive outcome on the reasons of engineering yeah absolutely i mean you can actually use the fact that you know people exhibit bias to get them to do something that's positive um it just so happens that there's probably more negative things can happen because people aren't aware. Because normally biases reflect some level of ignorance or over-focus on one piece of information at the expense of another. Now, the biases are basically a negative aspect in the decision-making process. But the end result could still be positive. In episode three of this podcast, I had Gabriel Lavinia from JVVA, and he mentioned that in version four of FTS, there was a default reaction that had very low soothill value, which defines how much smoke you generate while burning something in your numerical model. And because it was the default reaction reaction many people were using it for simulations of fires in buildings and and because of that they've received outputs that were very unrealistic because they had very very low amount low amount of smoke in their simulations so that's an example of how an under conservative default can cause actually errors in modeling. And it's obviously not something for the FDS developers to put a shame on because they've developed a beautiful piece of software. It was just users that were unaware that the default is unapplicable to their scenario. So here changing the default value to something else can actually lead to more safer outcomes in the hands of an experienced user. And yeah, we must consider that there will be some unexperienced users using the models. Earlier in the talk, you've mentioned a lot of managing uncertainties. And one of the ways is to run multiple simulations. lot of managing uncertainties and one of the ways is to run multiple simulations and that was also one of the questions in your survey where you've asked if people run just a single scenario for the evacuation or they run multiple scenarios and if they do multiple how they pick the number of scenarios do they use convergence criteria or they just use a certain number of of runs predetermined in in their previous experience. And I'm actually in that last group. Maybe I should move to some convergence-based monitoring of my results. But I'm really curious about that aspect of the survey. Could you comment about that? Yeah, so I think the interesting thing about the evacuation modelling biases survey was that we initially set out to look at biases in three areas. One was research, one was development, and one was the application by fire engineers. So we proposed some biases that researchers even might exhibit during research into fire evacuations, how the developers themselves might exhibit some biases and then the fire engineers. And then we thought, well, let's do a survey to try and quantify or identify to what extent these may actually occur. So it was really interesting seeing where some of the biases occur, but also where they don't occur, which is actually quite reassuring. some of the biases occur, but also where they don't occur, which is actually quite reassuring. And also the reasons why you might think something is a bias, but actually it's imposed behavior. So, for example, we thought that there was a bias to do with model selection. People will be biased to choose a given model that they're more familiar with. But it turns out that a lot of people, their company only buys one model and they're kind of imposed to use it. So whilst there is a bias to use a given model, it's not through ignorance of consideration. It's through to the situations being imposed upon them. In terms of specifically looking at the number of repeat simulation runs, most people said actually they would run multiple runs, which is really reassuring. It's only about 13% which said they would only run one run. And then you could see there was a reasonable spread in terms of the methods they would use to choose the number of repeat simulation runs. There's no right or wrong answer with this question because the jury is still out on the best method to determine the number of repeat simulation runs. So the survey wasn't just trying to identify biases, it was trying to identify what are people currently doing in the field as well. And in the survey, did you ask about decision process modeling, if people are using it, or maybe they are thinking that they are using it, but they're not really doing that. Were there any questions related to that? One of the things we did ask was, would you run multiple scenarios looking at different things happening in the evacuation process? So, for example, if exits were blocked, if different proportions of people used the exits, things like that. Most people, most of the respondents said that they would look at different multiple scenarios. And the most common reasons were looking at stairs being blocked. They looked at the impact of demographic groups and the different impacts of pre-evacuation times. So looking at different scenarios is one way you can look at differences in decision making because different things are happening or you're representing different things. So this is actually a really good sign. Most people would run more than one scenario. Yeah, that is certainly reassuring. And I think it comes down to the fact that, again, how we are learned to do the fire engineering and we are learned to avoid systems which create a single point failure mechanism, that a single point failure can create catastrophical outcomes, which in evacuation could be caused by the only exit route being blocked. And doing these multiple scenarios to block different routes to seek if a scenario occurs in which such a blockade can have very, very onerous effects is very powerful because you are truly investigating the vulnerabilities of the building, and then you can act on them and fix them. And I think that's the ultimate goal of being the fire engineer, to find the weak spots of the building and fix them and prevent catastrophic fires from happening. Touching a bit on data, I wanted to move to tall building evacuations, super tall building evacuation procedures. Because of the way how the buildings are designed, staircase capacity, the exit door capacity is usually connected to the amount of people on one or maybe two or three floors together, not the whole population of the whole building. the whole population of the whole building. And this leads to an obvious consequence that if you evacuate the whole building through the same staircase and you have the maximum number of users, it will take a very long time to evacuate and the people will be queued in the staircase for a very, very long time. And this is something we deal with in my case using concepts of phased evacuation, in which you evacuate building floor by floor, maintaining the capacity of the evacuation routes and minding for the amount of people that are in the staircase at the same time to not have too many people queued there, so people do not wait for their turn to use the staircase and exit the building. And this leads to a much more optimized evacuation process, in my opinion, just a much less stressful evacuation process. However, when we face the authorities or firefighters, they usually want us to showcase the total evacuation of the building. I think it is in a way connected to their perception that the people are only safe when they are out and that you want to have them all out as soon as possible. And in fact, the total evacuation may yield a shorter total evacuation time, but at the cost of people waiting on the staircase for their turn to run away. So I was wondering if anything of our today's discussion of the biases and the concepts and how people take decisions, if any of this could be used to convince the authorities or firefighters that maybe the phased evacuation could be a much safer way to rescue people in the building? Yeah, this is an interesting question. So specifically for me, because I work in China, it's interesting to know that any super high-rise building, so that's any building over 250 meters, you have to build an evacuation model of a full simultaneous building evacuation there's no acceptance criteria um but you have to build one and show how long it would take to fully clear simultaneously um you mean like a total evacuation from top to the bottom everyone out yeah exactly everyone at the same time in fact i recently, I commonly do them. And often you can employ lifts as part of the process, which we encourage, especially with facilitating evacuation of persons with reduced mobility. And as you've rightly said, the main, what we're trying to achieve when we do phased evacuation is we want to get people, it's not just about the total evacuation time, it's about getting people who are most exposed to the fire away from the fire as quickly as possible. Now if you evacuate the whole building at the same time, that could mean the people on the fire floor or the fire affected floors are going to take longer to get into the protected escape routes. So this is one of the reasons that you have this phased evacuation. Another reason is that most fires are not going to be very big. If you've got working, well-maintained fire systems, then the fire won't spread. So if you don't ask the whole building to evacuate, that aids in things like business continuity as well. Now, especially if you're talking about certain businesses which have huge net worths such as banks and things like that. It's serious amounts of money. And you have to think as fire engineers, obviously, life safety is paramount. But we're also considering business continuity and business resilience and impact as well. So that's one of the reasons that we look, we generally typically adopt phased evacuations. It is more complicated. It does put more onus on building management and the fire service to orchestrate the process. But that's one of the reasons we adopt that. I was more thinking about how to use biases to understand the decision-makers' processes and the way why they force us to the total evacuation. But you bring a lot of valid points in that, and I think they are very useful to consider. I think it also relates to this concept of perception of safety and what's perceived as safe and what truly is safe. and what's perceived as safe and what truly is safe. I mean, having a few thousand people on a staircase generating heat and being clamped in a small confined space, it's not something that I would consider safe. And then again, you may consider some of these people were not even endangered by the fire, which was going on a completely different floor, and maybe it was a very small fire that was already under control, but they're suddenly stuck on the staircase. And yeah, I think this goes far beyond our discussion on biases. But I mean, you're an engineer in Shanghai, so who can have more experience with tall buildings than you? How do you deal with these kinds of things in your general engineering practice? Maybe you've participated in a drill of evacuating a huge skyscraper. Yeah, I think most of my work is involved in the design process of new builds. So quite often when the drills are happening, we've already been involved in the design process. But I've certainly been involved in evacuation drills within China, and I've seen other researchers do work in high-rise buildings. Generally, when the drills happen, generally people, not too many people, I would say, become injured. Now, that is certainly not recorded as being injured, I would say. And that doesn't mean they don't happen. We know that one of the biggest causes of accidents and injuries, even death, just in everyone's life is through slips, trips, and falls. Now, the minute you start asking people to go vertically, traveling vertically, then you're at more risk. And there are certain demographics which are more susceptible to risk so the very old or the very young so certainly buildings where if your office buildings typically perhaps a younger population perhaps they'll have a lower chance of injury but where you have anywhere where you might have an increased elderly population or young population, then there is even more of a risk of slips, trips and falls. This is going into such an interesting direction, but I'm really mindful of your time. And I think we have to end around in here. But let's let's keep this discussion open for the next time. And we definitely need to come back to skyscraper fire safety and maybe the fire safety in china in general um i'm very thankful that you took the invitation to the podcast episode and all the things that you've shared with with my audience um if people would like to connect with you or learn more about your research where should they seek information where can they find you uh i think probably on twitter um we can perhaps include a link of my Twitter account, and I generally try to keep that updated with any research. And also I post things about just quirky things that happen in China which don't necessarily happen in the fire safety world around the rest of the world. Yeah, I'll drop the links in the show notes, and I'll also link all the discussed papers and research studies that we have mentioned through the episode so the listeners have an easier way to find them so um mike once again thank you so much for joining me at the podcast thanks a lot thanks and see you around and that's it i hope you've enjoyed that a lot. I certainly did. And as you probably noticed at the end of the talk, I could discuss evacuation with Michael for ages. And there's just so much you can learn from him. And his extreme experience in this field is unimaginable. I hope I'll be able to get him once again in the podcast to maybe discuss some more practical aspects of evacuation modeling and designing buildings for a safe evacuation of people. In regards to the theme of the episode, the biases and how decisions are taken, I hope we've shared some really good insight. We had some really good insight. And more importantly, we've discussed in depth how these decisions impact our predictions, our modeling, our calculations, and the way how we design buildings for the safe evacuation of people. Of course, to know more and understand how these biases impact our design processes, you should know all the biases that Mike has identified. And to do that, I highly recommend reading his paper that's linked in the show notes or maybe watching some of his lectures that are available on YouTube. And from this, you will learn more about particular biases. In the episode, I wanted to put the focus on the reasons why you should do that, not the biases themselves. So I hope this is a starting point. And I hope this forum is appropriate for the podcast. If not, please let me know. I'm still experimenting with it. And the last thing that I wanted to share is something that Mike said in the green room before we started the interview. And actually, that was pretty interesting. He mentioned that when he discussed this subject of biases, heuristic with his colleagues, with other researchers in the field, he expected that people will be like, no, Mike, that's silly. Why would you investigate such a thing? These are not serious research topics. But it was quite opposite when he mentioned that to people, the reactions were that people really think that, yeah, this is how I actually think. This is how I take decisions. These are the things that impact my own decisions. I can see by myself that if I was in such a situation, I would act in a similar way. by myself that if I was in such a situation, I would act in a similar way. And I must say that when he said that, I had the exact same feeling that, yeah, these biases, they pretty well describe my own behavior and the way how I take decisions. So if they are correct in predicting my behavior, they actually may be correct in predicting behavior of multiple people. And once you couple that with multi-parametric simulations, with Monte Carlo simulations, with thousands of analysis of different behaviors, and you suddenly emerge into a whole new world of modeling in which you have such a broader overview on the outcomes of your evacuation modeling. And I'm not just talking about finding the extreme values of the evacuation time related to your pre-evacuation time distribution. No, no. I'm talking about finding scenarios in which particular tree of decision has resulted in a catastrophic outcome. And actually, if we are able to find such scenarios, we can act on that and we can build safer buildings based on that. And on top of that, the concept of nudging, affecting the decisions subconsciously, making sure that people are more likely to make decisions with a favorable outcome. That's such a powerful tool that I'm not sure if we have used so far, and we definitely should, especially that it can be used by non-fire specialists like architects, system designers, lighting designers. All these people can use the concept of nudging to design buildings which guide the person to safety in a more efficient way. So, yeah, that's quite a lot to unpack. I hope you've enjoyed the episode and you will enjoy your reading. And that's before you, because you really should take a look at the paper of cognitive biases. And yeah, that's all from my side today. And see you next Wednesday in episode 10 of the Fire Science Show. Thank you for being here. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
