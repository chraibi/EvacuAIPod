 Hello and welcome to the Magical Paint Podcast, your weekly source of knowledge and inspiration on how to give fire resistance to any material with just a single layer of paint. No primer required. And today we're gonna learn everything you need to know about how to give fire resistance to the underwater parts of pylons. Actually, I'm horrible at making jokes, apologies. violence. Actually, I'm horrible at making jokes. Apologies. It was an attempt on April Fool, but it kind of doesn't work when your podcast does not air on April Fool's Day. It seems that the next opportunity is 2026 for that. And yeah, you better be ready. I'll work on the comedy skills. And for today, well, if you hope for magic paint i'm not gonna have great information for you but for everyone else today we're gonna talk about something very fundamental and that is the safety per se or what is safety actually we're gonna talk about risk-based concepts in fire safety engineering but that conversation has drifted towards really fundamental and important aspects on what we are doing, how we are doing it, and what are the boundaries of what should we do. And I find the conversation great because of the great guests I had. And these are Professor Ruben Van Coyle from Ghent University and Professor Dannykin from OFR and Sheffield University. And they're both worldwide known experts in structural fire engineering and performance-based structural fire engineering and risk methods in this field. So it was natural to ask them about how the risk-based concepts are intertwined with structural fire engineering. But, oh boy, we went quite far away from just that, touching really, really interesting things on how probabilistic methods can be applied, how risk methods can be applied, why should they be applied, and how can you benefit from that. And if I may give you a hint, the episode gets better and better till the end with some really cool things being said in the very last part of it. So if you're not usually listening to the end of the episode, this one you may actually want to. Okay, so let's not prolong this and let's give a chance to join our conversation on risk-based methods in fire engineering. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody and welcome to Fireside Show. I'm today with two professors I admire. First, Professor Ruben Van Coyle from Gandy University. Hi Ruben, great to have you in the podcast. Thanks for the invitation. Yeah, yeah. I must be a starter. A disproportionate number of people interested in this podcast in my home county, yeah. Yeah, I wonder if there's us interested in structural fire engineering and risk approaches in that as in timber. We'll see, we'll see. So you probably wonder why I have brought you in here. Well, actually, you know, it's the risk methods in fire safety engineering and actually risk methods in structural fire engineering, because I find it quite interesting that many aspects of risk acceptance, probability approaches, different ways on how to design structures made its way to structural fire engineering and seem to be quite well developed in there. and seem to be quite well developed in there. To start with, in what way these performance-based approaches make its way into structural fire engineering? For me, as someone who's running a fire laboratory, it's usually a very straightforward way to demonstrate safety. You know, I put things in the furnace. If they meet the criteria after 60 minutes of the experiment, they have the classification. And we're not really exploring much alternative roads, maybe because Poland is a very prescribed country. And I wonder, how do you see the use of these advanced methods in structural engineering? So it's funny the way you mentioned it actually. You say, I can, if I quote that correctly, demonstrate safety. So my question would be is that what you are doing when you do classification tests? I'm probably at links with earlier discussions you had on Postgres regarding timber structures and so on. I'll answer. It's what the architect thinks I'm doing, and that's what my stakeholders think I'm doing. That's what the society thinks I am doing. And yeah, you caught me on guard that that's not what I'm doing. But that's a very, very good point. You should start a podcast. But what you're saying is already potentially a major problem, right? So if your stakeholders think you are doing something, delivering safety, and you know that you're maybe not really doing that because it's a classification system and prescriptive guidance, then we have a completely different discussion about what should you actually do, right? But to answer the question, the more probabilistic structure of fire safety. So, yeah, but then if you would look into the uncertainties you have on potential fire load, opening factor, your loads, your structure, which is changing during fire, take into account uncertainties, then maybe together with your model uncertainties, you get to a point where you say, well, okay, now I understand the performance, and this is necessarily in probabilistic terms, just because every fire is different and so on. And when you know your performance in probabilistic terms, then we can talk about actual safety. Nice. That's good. Danny, you want to add something? Yeah, I can give you... You want to stab me as well? Danny, you want to add something? Yeah, I can give you. You want to stab me as well? No, no, I'll save that. Ruben can be a bad cop. I'll be a good cop. So my first foray into this area, and you know from the previous podcast that my doctorate was in mass timber, and I feel like my postdoc, if you like, is in reliability under Ruben's tutoring. That's kind of how the relationship works. As a consultant, we were often faced with this kind of conundrum where we were doing fire engineering calculations. One of the most common things structural fire engineers will do is the sort of the time equivalence calculation, where you're trying to determine from first principles the fire resistance period for a building based on the fire intensity and when doing that calculation you as the user you have so many decisions that you have to make about parameters that you use that really influence the outcome of that calculation you and so you have to make a decision about what is reasonable in the circumstances for that building whether it's the size of the opening whether it's the percentile of the fire load you use. And my experience prior to coming to any of this with any real knowledge of what was happening was you entered into some very subjective debates with authorities having jurisdiction about what values you should use, why, and what level of conservatism is fit for purpose in the given application. And there was never really a good answer or an objective answer as to why one outcome of that process was more right or correct than another one. And so I got quite interested in how we quantify safety and how we decide what is enough and under what circumstances that level of safety we try and achieve as it varies from one building to the next. And so for me, this whole topic became a very objective way of deciding what level of safety we want to achieve for a given building based upon its given circumstances. And in terms of how have we got to this point where it's developing some maturity in structural fringing, I think part of that is because it is already very mature as a concept in structural engineering. And I was never taught this whilst I studied structural engineering, but actually, when you're designing at ambient temperature, you are designing in a semi-probabilistic framework where your safety factors, whether they're on your loads, whether they're on your materials, have been calibrated to deliver some predetermined outcome in terms of the sort of maximum failure probability of that element. And then they're all sort of grouped into different consequence classes. So it felt quite logical for me when I came into this area working with Ruben that you're kind of just extending a concept that you're doing anyway at ambient temperature and then taking it into structural fire design. And so actually you're just being relatively consistent in how you're designing your structure just for a different hazard. It makes sense historically because this concept was already proven. That's the way you design structures. And you extend this beyond the ambient. You go into fire temperatures and pretty much use the similar framework to build on whatever is acceptable safety for you, which we will reach. But I wanted to ask now, but why did I think I'm proving safety in my fire resistance? That's actually quite a good question. Why it is so, how to say, juxtaposed to the concept of safety that you get this class, you're safe. You don't have this class, you're not safe. Is it some sort of, I don't know, collective experience gathered through the ages? Is it a matter of ease? Because let's face it, fire is a complex problem, and fire resistance is a fairly simple thing. You put something on the furnace, you get the result. Why is it so welded to our understanding of safety, this concept, and maybe how could we benefit by unwelding it from it? Okay, so first of all, the background for fire-resistant classification, and you had a podcast episode about that. So, I mean, all kinds of historical background, I'm no expert in it, and it's a system which apparently has worked reasonably well. I would say, indeed, that based on experience we've, as a society, right, developed guidance codes, which for normal and common buildings actually has decent fire resistance requirements and other requirements. And the issue then is when you start pushing your design by introducing new materials, by going beyond aspects where you have lots of experience about. And at that point, your old fire resistance classes, or at least your requirements on those fire resistance classes, they don't really apply anymore, right? And I think we need to then, on a second point, make a bit of a distinction between the fire resistance classification and obtaining a certain safety level in the building. And from that perspective, I would say it's probably not a perfect method, the fire resistance classification. But in principle, you could say, well, you can still use it. It's very convenient. European market, international market. You buy a product in one country, go to another country, and so on. So it's great. And then just depending on the building you have, and maybe depending on the material in the building, you would have a different fire resistance class requirement. As in different material will have a different safety level and so a different requirement that way. When I read your papers, I don't remember in which it was the first shown, but you've shown this safety design triangles. And the distinction between these two approaches where one was based on experience, second was based on evidence. And while experience could work for known hazards, known buildings, known problems, like you said, known from the past, we have as a humanity, we have a collective experience in providing, let's say, fire safe buildings in many occupations. in providing, let's say, fire-safe buildings in many occupations. But then you build something new, something with completely new materials, some exceptional design that has never been accomplished. And this experience is too short. You then need to show evidence that it works. I don't know if you need, but I assume that's probably a way if you want to achieve an optimal structure without exceptional margins of safety that you would put on top of that if you only wanted to project experience. Or can you even project experience? Like, let's put aside the advanced methods and all the probabilistics. methods and all the probabilistics. Can you reasonably project experience by applying safety factors or this approach is deemed to fail at some point? Okay. Difficult. The first time we published something about the safe triangle was actually in the SFP magazine, which Danny led. And the concept of our guided documents and so on are generally based on experience. It's nothing fundamentally new. You have one paper I like a lot by Spinardi on the sociological issues in fire safety, and then there's a part which talks about that in more detail. Crucial thing, I would say, is that you have to realize that when you are doing a design based on prescriptive guidance, or when you are doing a performance-based design based on a single credible worst-case evaluation, or a set of credible worst-case evaluations, you are making decisions about risk in the end. Your design, the design you have, has a risk profile, which I mean probabilities, consequences, combinations of the two. profile, which I mean, probabilities, consequences, combinations of the two. So fundamentally, there is no difference if you go from risk bottom up, instead of just immediately picking something. Whatever you build, it always has a risk profile. And then say, can you just use safety factors and so on? Well, we're not really there yet. and so on, well, we're not really there yet. As in the work we're doing with Danny, with Thomas Genet, with Nigar Elham Khorassani, and many other collaborators, we are generally still working full probabilistic. We've been trying to have some kind of safety factors, like a global safety factor here or there. I mean, we're trying to find a way to go forward. But the probabilities in fire are generally not so, let's say, well-behaving that we can easily define a safety factor which applies everywhere. I think you meant like explicit safety factors. What I meant is if a tall building has two hours walls, let's make a super tall building have four-hour walls just in case. This type of anecdotal safety factors. four-hour walls just in case, this type of anecdotal safety factors. Danny, do you think we can project safety from experience on unknown structures? Is it even... Because our governments do that, man. It's like, if you want to stop them, let's better explain them why not. Danny Housley No, I think in our publications, we argue quite robustly in favor of not doing that quite explicitly because fire engineering generally as Ruben's explained this is predominantly deterministic we we have maybe a single scenario we have two or three scenarios and and you as the engineer you'll make decisions about the outcome you're trying to achieve and the and the inputs you put into that process and it's almost through trial and error that we apply this deterministic approach that leads to a building that gets built and then we get to observe whether that approach ultimately led to some outcomes that we didn't consider unacceptable or if there was an unacceptable outcome then effectively we recalibrate ourselves and that might inform the magnitude of the inputs or the conservatism in the performance criteria that we apply. And so you're inherently limited to cases that you get to experience to kind of guide you as to what level of conservatism you need to apply in that process. And so if you're extrapolating for a variety of different reasons, you are extrapolating to a case that you're very likely to experience. So you have no priori sort of knowledge of what sort of rough magnitude of safety factor you need to apply. And so this is where we argue in favour of it in this safe design triangle that actually there must be this explicit evaluation of the safety level because um you don't have that anchor it is quite sort of definite it is an exceptional case that you're up against and how does one obtain this explicit evidence of safety so conceptually at least it's it's we introduce there's a few different ways and we do this in 7974 through acceptance concepts as we refer to them where at one extreme you have what is a effectively a comparative assessment so you made sure that the safety level of your building is in keeping with something that that could be built following a recognized code and is therefore being kind of massaged or calibrated to meet society's expectations for the safety levels that they want to achieve. Sorry, but could you like, let's say I have building A, I have building B that is slightly different. So I say B is almost the same as A. My B is safe by comparison. But then it's building C, then it's building D. At some point, does the chain need to connect to this building A in which the safety was proven, or can we extrapolate by tiny steps? No, you certainly can't extrapolate. And so this is where we introduce what are kind of implicit or explicit tests on tolerability, is the terminology we use. And so you as the designer have always got to make sure that your reference design is kind of compatible with the range of outcomes you you might expect to witness in whatever your proposed design is and so you can't reference the the burj khalifa against the two-story house or that kind of extreme comparison. And for those kind of cases, what we actually kind of encourage people towards is this kind of fully quantified risk assessment process where you evaluate the sort of risk profile, the residual risks associated with the design, and you benchmark them against some kind of acceptance criteria. and you benchmark them against some kind of acceptance criteria. And I think that's kind of the tricky thing at the moment is conceptually we can quantify the individual risk, the probability of 100 fatalities or the FN curve, as it's commonly known. What we're lacking, and it's not really within our gift necessarily as designers to establish, is that acceptance criteria or that tolerability limit in terms of what normal societal stakeholders expect buildings to do and that's kind of the job of the regulator really I think to set those criteria which we do in the UK for different hazards for nuclear with the health and safety executive for example in fire safety we've never seemingly approached the problem from this fully quantified and explicit level of risk that we're willing to accommodate. When I was reading your papers, there were many names used to refer to acceptance criteria, acceptable, adequate, tolerable, and they all have these flavors. And it seems there's quite a big difference between what's adequate and what's tolerable. So what would be the goal? Would it be an acceptable risk or safety, acceptable or tolerable safety? Because I'll drop a punch as well. I loved it in SFP in Rotterdam, on Brian Smichim's talk, there was a guy who said that the current goal is catnip. Cheapest available technology not involving persecution. And he was so spot on on what would be the preferred level for the industry who's building the buildings, not necessarily the owners or users. So I feel like the challenge is even defining, like, should we find the cheapest, the best, the most reasonable, the most adequate? There you are, from my interpretation, referring to different perspectives, really, and the risk evaluation also and the cost evaluation. So, yes, the costs of fire safety are different depending on which perspective you take. depending on which perspective you take. And on a given project, on the one hand side, you would have general societal costs and benefits of having a fire safety design where society has limits on how much it can invest in fire safety. Makes, in a way, or should make perfect sense. And you keep on investing in fire safety at some point. You should have spent that money on something else. Maybe it's education, maybe it's healthcare. But your benefits or your marginal benefits is reducing. And then you have private stakeholder who might think that the fire safety issue is not their problem. And they just want to get the building built, in which case the private stakeholder should adopt the country's requirements. So it can be legal requirements, it can be guidance requirements. Or maybe in a specific case, the stakeholder wants a higher safety level because it's a warehouse and if the warehouse burns down completely without compartmentation, without suppression systems, the company is out of business. And maybe this is something which is not acceptable to this private stakeholder, while the country, society can say, well, this is not our problem. And then, so this is one private stakeholder, but of course you have many. So then, yeah, indeed, when you are on a project, maybe a contractor is, well, maybe, definitely a contractor is tempted to substitute a product if on paper they have the same performance, and one is considerably cheaper than the other one. So I guess communication is a very key issue there. I really wonder who should have the final say in that. Is it the society? Is it the investor? Is it the contractor? Because as you said, they will have completely different objectives. Like society, I think for societal level, it would be the, let's say, having the statistics low enough that they don't cause social unrest. Maybe I define it horribly, but from a societal level, the goal would be completely different than from a subcontractor level who, if he saves money, if they save money, they earn money, actually, because the savings may be their profit. So you have completely different set of objectives there at each level of construction of the same building. And the investor, you said the investor may be one kind that wants to have just meet the low requirements as they are and be done with it at the cheapest cost possible. Or you could have an investor who knows that they're going to store some important materials in the building that are critical for their company and they would like to have double or triple the safety normal because it is so important for them and they would be willing to overpay for that so that's a whole set of competing objectives and i don't even see how you could fit that within a low framework actually it's not in a law framework the structure should you get very very strict in a sense you have the societal requirements and then you have the question, how do you get those societal requirements into a legal framework? But you have the societal requirements, and that is the minimum, and it should be. As like some sort of baseline, this is the minimum. Yes, and then private stakeholders have the freedom to go beyond that. And what beyond that means and so on means we can discuss about that a lot but fundamentally and that's my personal opinion maybe in a way but there is it's very clear societal minimum requirements and then private stakeholders can go beyond so it's up to the fire engineer up to the architect and so on to to open that conversation especially on the maker project, I would say, and make sure that different private stakeholders are aware about what they're actually getting. Because returning to the beginning of this podcast, you kind of indicated that people probably think they're getting safety or think they're getting something, and maybe they're not. As in certain fire resistance resistance if my building has a fire resistance which is required by the legislation i think i'm just hypothetically that my building will survive burnout now does it as the fire engineer you might be aware that this is not necessarily the case at which point should have the discussion with the architect with the stakeholder and so on other ones say like by the way maybe we want to look into this more instead of just going for the r60 or whatever it is that we need yeah i think what ruben's explained is is entirely compatible with the kind of the legislative format in most countries your your building regulations are there to represent predominantly the interests of the societal stakeholders and set that minimum boundary condition on what's acceptable. And then anything you want to do that's beyond that, whether it's business continuity or property protection, that decision is left at the private stakeholder level to make that investment. Sorry, but I have to drop a bomb on you. Go on. But what if my law is stupid? What if my law is nowhere? Like, you assume that the law would give the minimum. And in a perfect world, it would. But my law is nowhere close minimum. At points, it's ridiculous. At points, it's overexceeding something I would call reasonable. Am I doomed? Or I guess these concepts could also help me find a new reasonable minimum if my minimum is stupid. Yes, so definitely if the strata requirements are too high, you could do, through calculations, for example, evaluations and show that this fire resistance requirement you have here is a big overinvestment. This doesn't make sense. Let's reduce it. In that case, you have an argument there. Depending on the legal framework, you have to ask for deviation. It can be an argument. And also, it really is input or should be input in developing new codes and guidance. The other situation is very interesting. A situation where the legal requirements and then again through the guidance may be depending on the country too low. And then this is I think very important for fire engineers and for architects and so on. Just following those guidance things doesn't mean that you are free from your liability and so on. If you are as a fire engineer aware that this doesn't really make sense you are free for liability and so on. If you are, as a fire engineer, aware that this doesn't really make sense, you are involved and you just hide behind the guidance or the legal document. Something happens, if it turns bad, I'm convinced that your liability question is not that clear, as some people might think. And Danny, does objective minimum exist? Is there an objective baseline to which I could refer regardless of my country where I am? Or is it like, because if you ask a politician, okay, let's agree on how many fatalities per year can occur. And let's start with that. You will never get an answer. No one will ever answer. No politician will ever answer this. No one like I have this feeling it is super difficult to when you start quantifying safety, it starts to be horribly hard to agree on what is this acceptable minimum. I think it's more easy to agree on some artificial thing like 30 minute fire resistance for this building is okay, rather than accept on, okay, if we have a fatality every 10 minus 6, like you have 10 to minus 6 probability you one is very artificial, very misguiding, very abstract, but agreeable. The second is very precise, sharp, well-defined, but somehow difficult to get consensus between stakeholders. Do you have this impression as well? as well yeah and it's interesting you use the word acceptable because ultimately society are judged jury and executioner on what is acceptable and and fortunately we don't get to go out and quiz the 60 million people for their opinion on what frequency of return of a fatality is is would be tolerable to them and so we've dealt with this historically through um kind of this these concepts of revealed and stated preferences in particular and we've placed values on on lives out of that process and ultimately we've tried to seek to balance the costs and benefits which is an objective way of looking at the problem. But it doesn't take into account necessarily or is it's difficult to gauge society's view on what would actually be acceptable to them until they've experienced it. So you're right. It's very tricky. And actually, the way the structural engineering gets around this is to deal with everything in a quite straightforward risk, what's arguably a risk control way, which is simply let's look at the lifetime cost of our building and let's minimize its lifetime cost. And that is the acceptable safety level, the failure probability corresponding to that minimum investment over the lifetime of that building. And they do that by factoring in that your safety investment in a building is upfront. You put your protection in, you put your systems in. That has a cost. Those systems might not be called upon through the lifetime of the building or they're called upon at some low probability. lifetime in the building or they're called upon at some low probability and in that event that those systems fail you you have some fatalities you have some damage you have some indirect costs all of which you can evaluate and so you're you're constantly trying to embark to balance how much you're investing up front in a building against future unknown costs and so instructor engineering they've kind of come up with these effectively model situations where they look at this lifetime cost for a series of model buildings and they determine these minima in in terms of the cost and that corresponds with a safety target per annum whether it's a failure probability of one times ten to the minus five one times ten to minus six one times ten to the minus seven and And so it's a very cold in many respects, balancing or optimizing of costs and benefits. the second thing I think my life is valued more than my neighbors and we come into societal versus individual risk acceptance in a way I can accept pretty high societal risk but when it's to myself I would prefer not you know this is in a way very I find this discussion very difficult in fire engineering. In structural engineering, it also involves the calculation of, let's say, fatalities and probably, yeah, probably it had to. In a way, yes, although it seems to be often not the dominant factor, which makes it maybe in discussion wise a bit easier. The cost of the building and so on is so high. But in the end, when we're talking about societal requirements, we're talking always about, at least conceptually, an alarm requirement. So reducing the risk as low as is reasonably practicable. If it's, I mean, say, a concept, so whether or not your local legal system is different, that doesn't really fundamentally matter. The concept is clear. We're trying to reduce the risk as much as is reasonable. And what is reasonable? Well, that depends how much society can pay for it. And how much can society pay for it? Well, also reasonably, it depends how rich the society is. And because you want to spend money in society for pleasure and private things, but for education, for those hospitals, for all kinds of stuff. So the valuation of risk to human life, there are different approaches to it. You can ask people, you can look at how much people are paid in their jobs. Personally, I'm very reluctant about those kinds of studies because very weird things come out of that. As you can probably imagine. The approach that we in our papers have used and also which is, by the way, adopted in the ISO standards 2394, which is, by the way, adopted in the ISO standards 2394, which is for structural reliability, really, is the life quality index. So it includes a balancing. It takes into account GDP. It takes into account life expectancy. Taking those two together, it finds how much society is capable of paying, on average, across all kinds of risks for reducing risk to life. I can imagine where these studies go because if you start valuing this, you will also reflect all the inequalities of the world in this index and you can come to conclusions which cannot be published. Well, this is very interesting. So I was teaching exactly this kind of topic a couple of weeks ago, a lecture on risk management. One of the students was a student from Pakistan. And this may be an uncomfortable thing to mention in a lecture. I said, well, actually, depending on GDP and life expectancy we take into account, there's a valuation of risk to life and so on. And they said, well, but it's fundamental because if a country were to adopt a standard, like an American standard, European standard, which is too expensive, then this country is over-investing in whatever it is, structural safety, fire safety, and actually losing welfare that way. safety and actually losing welfare that way. And this particular student raised his hand and applied with an example on fire safety in Pakistan. Apparently they adopted an international standard and as far as I understood it turned into something they had to change because it was just not practicable, too expensive for them to do so. Danny, you've mentioned the ways to demonstrate safety through the roots of PD. And you've mentioned this comparison. I know another way is to find this minimum, like the minimalist level of safety and just go with that if that's acceptable. But there was also like three pathways that allow you to actually demonstrate safety, whatever the safety is maybe maybe you would like to go into these pathways because i found them very interesting in terms of of what tools and what challenges are related you mean the acceptance concepts yeah yeah yeah so there's kind of three core ways of doing it and then there was variations on a theme within those acceptance concepts so we've touched on the first one which is this this sort of comparative assessment where basically you're assessing the the residual risk profile of that building as a reference point and then you're designing your building to make sure that your residual risk or failure probability however you want to think of it is consistent with that reference building and and at no point are you assessing if the range of consequences in your building and their likelihood explicitly tolerable to to society you're kind of assuming that the if it was if it wasn't then it is for yours and and therefore you're kind of you're making an assumption that the range of consequences and their likelihood in your building are broadly similar to what you have in your reference building. And then we extend that concept slightly where you have that comparative analysis that you have, what is this sort of explicit assessment of the consequences and their likelihood. So you actually have an explicit check on this tolerability threshold. But they're kind of the comparative parts. The other one we postulate, which is, I think, it's a really nice idea. It's actually very difficult to achieve in practice is this explicit safety target idea, which is what we have in structural engineering under ambient conditions. So if you look in EN 1990 Annex B, there are consequence classes or reliability classes for structures 1, 2, and 3, and they are basically a gradation of the number of fatalities and material damage that you would expect. So 3 being a high number of fatalities and a high amount of damage. And as you move through those those um structurally structural failure induced consequences if the failure probability uh that you accept or is optimal is i guess i suppose the right term reduces so you go from sort of one times ten to minus five to one times ten to minus six to one percent to minus seven and so we kind of hypothesize that you could develop such a thing for fire safety engineering where you have a series of safety targets. So if you were designing, I don't know, a 10-story residential building, then the probability of fatality should be at some threshold. And if you demonstrate that you meet that threshold, then it is implicitly a LARP. It's satisfied that condition. It's very like how tunnels are being designed in many European countries, especially Alpine, where you have FN curve that says, okay, at this point you're okay, at this point you have to admission safety solutions if they're practicable above that you're not allowed at all. Yeah, so there's a lot of work involved in arriving at what those targets should be. And it could be that, I don't know, a regulator gets around the table and just arbitrarily decides what those numbers are, or it could be something more involved like the structural engineering process, which is a series of kind of reference buildings and determining those optima. of kind of reference buildings and determining those optima. And then the final approach is this kind of full-blown quantitative risk assessment process where for your building, you're calculating the consequences, you're calculating all of their likelihoods, you're plotting effectively the FN curve for your building design, you're comparing it against some societal acceptance criteria, societal risk threshold. So that is determining that the design is tolerable. So in principle, you can build it if there wasn't a fire event in it and it had that profile of consequences and likelihood, there would unlikely be societal unrest. However, you are then obliged to go beyond that point and make sure that any further investment in the safety measures would be disproportionate to the benefits. And this is this condition, albeit we propose that actually that if you're satisfying this tolerability criteria, which is already has some level of disproportionality in it because you have a difference between society's point of view on 100 fatalities versus one that actually your cost benefit analysis your LARP demonstration simply resolves to is it more expensive are the costs more than the benefit and at that point you effectively stop investing so essentially your trial design would not end when you just satisfy the criteria but you go on you. You go on to check. If it can be reasonably improved. Exactly, exactly. And another way of looking at any one of these problems is when you test your failure probability of your residual risk profile and you find yourself in what we call the de minimis region. So that's the consequences and their likelihood are such a low profile that you kind of accept it by observation almost. It's just that the risk profile of the building is a couple of orders of magnitude below what's tolerable. And therefore, you have no flammable materials inside. So do not bother with that cost benefit assessment because you are already kind of at the floor in terms of where you're going to reach for the for the risk profile of your building and you mentioned residual is residual risk sorry how you find one uh i use i use that terminology very specifically and we do in most of our publications because i think maybe where we should have started the discussion is that in anything you design in anything that you build ultimately the risk is not zero there is some likelihood of some adverse event happening and you as the designer are trying to get that residual risk down to a level which is adequate is the term we use and so it's just acknowledging that you have never driven out all of that risk there is is a residual component to it, and you're trying to manage that residual component to a level which is adequate in the circumstances, whether that's because it's de minimis, whether that's because it satisfies the ALARC condition, whether it's proven to be equal to a reference design. When I do go into discussion with stakeholders about risk, I like to set up the discussion field with some ridiculous example. Like, okay, if a meteorite hits the building, are we okay with that? Or should we design against that? And it's usually, yeah, we're pretty okay with meteorites. Okay, so you have agreed that there is a level of residual risk you're willing to accept. Now let's move into fires. If a thousand megawatt fire happens in this building, which is very unlikely, let's say you have a sports arena, someone parked seven old tankers. This is impossible to happen. So you're okay with such risk? Yes, we are. Then let's try to find this most unreasonable scenario at which you are still okay because the scenario is so unreasonable. And then we suddenly start, you know, narrowing down to where is this boundary at which the low probability event would still be accepted. And that gives you one boundary to the equation. The second is like super like high probability, very low consequence events. Like if there is a fire of a trash bin, should I design against that? No, it's obvious it's the consequences will not be severe. So we're again in high probability, very low consequence region. And narrowing between these two probably at some point leads to acceptable, adequate tolerable risk, whatever that risk is. Am I following a good path there? First of all, Danny, you put that very nicely. So that was great. And what you're saying now, to me it sounds like you're talking about the tolerability there of your design. So yes, you have tolerability, very frequent, low consequence. At some point, it's not tolerable anymore, probably, as in if you have daily a fire, something is wrong. And then you have to design against that, from my perspective. So, this is a frequency limit. On the other hand side, you probably have, indeed, or at least I like the concept of having a consequence limit. You say, well, everything which, low probability, high consequence, the first thing you said, the probability is so low that, okay, I'm not going to consider this anymore. However, crucially, talking about tolerability does not, by itself, give you adequate safety because adequate safety is always conceptually a lie and which it doesn't always mean that you have to do a cost and benefit evaluation you could do that but we have these other routes right absolute safety comparative safety potentially and also it's also a very important point because you say, yeah, but still, this is not realistic what you're saying. Yeah, it can also be qualitative. As in, within that view on residual risk, as Danny pointed out, you can, as a designer, make a qualitative assessment of your risks, and maybe before doing any calculation, you're already come to the conclusion that your risk is de minimis. It's conceptually possible, So we're definitely not saying that you have to do all kinds of calculations for every design. Okay. And to close up the episode, let's try and clean out what all of this means to fire safety engineer. We started with buildings that are exceptional designs with new applications, started with buildings that are exceptional designs with new applications, new materials. Is this the place where you would go all the way in this analysis? Would you go there if you were only to demonstrate you can build a building cheaper? Or maybe you would go there to demonstrate that the low limits are unreasonable? Because I find many applications of what we are discussing in here, we're not, or you guys who are researchers, I don't think you're trying to find these answers just for the point of finding answers and having papers, but it's supposed to be practically useful to engineers. And I wonder, is there a boundary where one switches from prescriptive to this type of performance approach when it becomes really useful? So people start considering it's worth for them or if they should actually consider switching. So, I mean, when we wrote that first paper, the certain uncertainty one, I think that was very much a pitch to dealing with those exceptional cases where safety cannot be assumed to be achieved through or adequate safety through our collective experience. Because we've no longer got that guiding light of a massive building stock that experiences fires to kind of inform us on our design for our scenarios and our performance criteria. So that was where we initially made the appeal that it's in those uncommon building situations, I suppose is the term. But as a consultant, these kind of tools have become kind of commonplace in what we do at OFR in particular. So just a few ideas on how we apply structural reliability in what we do. It's a very powerful tool for appraising existing buildings in particular. So if you're faced with an existing building and there's some uncertainty about the level of performance you're achieving. And actually, it would be unreasonable to expect that existing building to satisfy a contemporary standard or guidance document. We will quite often use a reliability based method to appraise that structure to determine its failure likelihood and to compare that against some kind of acceptability criteria. And so it becomes a demonstration of an existing building having an adequate level of safety, and therefore it might not need a massive amount of remediation. And that's because when we go through that probabilistic process, we're able to weed out and quantify what can be an awful lot of conservatisms in what are deterministic approaches for structural design. So we can take into account the fact that the characteristic strength is actually a very low percentile. In reality, we have probably more strength than we expect. We can take into account the fact that the live load on any given day when we have a fire event is probably a lot lower than codes lead us to believe. We have the ignition frequency that we can take into account so it just becomes quite a a powerful tool in demonstrating that actually remediating something might not be a lot you might already be there by virtue of just having a lot of extra meat in and in your structure that you perhaps didn't contemplate. By taking to influence all the... Yeah, all the uncertainties. Actually getting, maybe not even getting grit, acknowledging where the safety factors were. Yeah. Especially the unintended safety factors that you just assume the worst case scenario if you had no idea of the distribution of the... Yeah. It's a bit like, say, as a structure engineer, you're told when you've got C30 concrete, that means it's got 30 MPa of strength. Well, no, actually, most of the time, it's much, much higher than that, and that just happens to be the characteristic strength for the purpose of code calibration. And so you can start to bring some of those extra distributions into play. And actually, Luke Bisbee gave a good talk about this at the i-strat t a few years ago what we like to think in guidance documents around fire resistance in particular in the uk and in england we have this quite weird strata where we have a fire resistance recommendation at five meters we now have one at 11 meters we have one at 18 meters we have one at 30 meters and then we have nothing like if it's 30 meters plus it's just give it two hours and and so it feels unbounded but when you look at our structural design regulations we actually have a boundary condition for disproportionate collapse which says for a consequence class three building which would be a 15-story office or a 15-story block of flats you have to do a systematic risk assessment for disproportionate collapse, taking into account all reasonable hazards, of which fire is a reasonable hazard for you to consider. So if we're dealing with a tool building, we will use some kind of probabilistic assessment of what the fire resistance period is and how the structure performs as part of that risk assessment process to support the structural engineering in addressing disproportionate collapse. And so a little sales pitch, and I think we've mentioned it before, we have this great tool that my colleague Ian Foo developed that we call SFE PRA, which is our kind of Python Monte Carlo library, which is this reliability based calculation of fire resistance periods for buildings and so that is something that we use almost on a day-to-day basis to inform what fire resistance we should be giving buildings taking into account their specific risk profiles their specific hazards and the specific consequences of their failure and ruben why do you teach all of this to your students besides torturing them with difficult concepts and needs to think. Because it's the basics, really. It's extremely fundamental. And as Danny said earlier, every design has a residual risk. So the thing we definitely should not do is assume that if you follow codes and guidance, that it has always been fine and it will always be fine in the future. That's definitely not the way to go. And there are two or at least two roads to use these kind of methods. One is to use advanced methods to improve guidance documents. And this is definitely something which we should do, not just from an academic perspective or anything, but also as society. This is very cost efficient or it can be very cost efficient. So you spend some money, do some investigation, you have yourself a guidance and you can follow that. I mean, guidance is great because that's the risk. If I talk about this, it all sounds, no, you have to throw away your guidance. Definitely not saying that. Guidance is great, very cost efficient for designing buildings. But that's on making guidance documents. very cost efficient for designing buildings. But that's on making guidance documents. Then you have on specific projects. Now, Danny gave a couple of examples just now, and I would basically say, or what I often say, or try to get over to the students as well, is that on every project, you have to assess, acknowledge what you don't know, right? So you have an open mind looking at the project, talk with the client about what you actually want to achieve and this discussion can be very short and in a sense that well we just want to get the building built but you have to have that kind of starting point where you define okay this is what i want to achieve for this building we're on the same page and then often using guidance can be enough but sometimes it will not be guidance. And sometimes, as Jake Samson gave, you will have an exceptional structure and then you don't really have a choice. I like positioning it as fundamental. Safety is safety, so let's not assume we have one. Let's quantify one. I like this. I think one of the appeals we commonly make is to this sort of concept of a consistency of crudeness. And I think that's the terminology we've used from Andy Buchanan in the first paper that we wrote. And what we seem to be doing as a community, we spend an awful lot of time developing really complicated tools to solve complicated problems. But actually, if you take them into the real world and try to apply them the first the biggest uncertainty i think we have when we're designing buildings is ultimately what we're trying to achieve and how we know we've achieved it in terms of the level of safety that we think we're getting the level of safety that we want and so you can throw all the finite element models and all the CFD models you want at the problem but if you have these massive error bars on what an adequate level of safety is and how you've quantified it then the precision of those instruments is irrelevant because you do not place them in the context of what's acceptable in the circumstances what's adequate in the circumstances and so this is why these tools are so fundamental because they are part of the engineering decision making that allows you to decide whether your design is achieving the goals you think it's achieving or not and our appeal to the community has really been let's invest more time and on this discussion because actually the incremental improvements you're making in finite element models or material understanding of load-induced transient thermal creep or whatever it might be those gains are so marginal compared to what level of safety are we trying to achieve and how do we know whether we've achieved it and yeah so so we make that plea and i think we still continue to make that plea here some five years later it seems you want to apply acceptance concept five to the discussion in the academic world and engineering world. Let's measure the return of our investments in science. I like that a lot. I like that. That's the third level of inception in this episode. I hope a lot of people made it to the end because the end was really strong. I might actually need to advertise it with the final words because it's definitely worth it. Okay, guys. Highly appreciate your time. I'm really happy. After seven months of arranging this, we finally met in the studio to talk it over. I'm really thankful for this discussion and that's a lot of things to think about. That's a lot of food to think about. That's a lot of food for thought. So I hope many people enjoyed it as much. Thank you so much, guys. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Cheers. Cheers. And that's it. Thank you for staying till the very end. I hope it was worth it. And I hope you're not disappointed with the lack of magical paint content in this episode. Regardless, I think it was quite a powerful discussion on what the risk methods are, how you can use them to find acceptance criteria, to find your vulnerability limits, to find your true safe solutions. And I really like the practical spin that Danny gave in the end with how this can be really, really used well for existing buildings and assessing their true level of safety. This is something I did not really consider before, but it makes so much sense that instead of blindly applying any modern solutions required by the codes like Magic Paint, required by the codes, like Magic Paint, you can go into full risk assessment and actually determine what is the residual level of safety of the existing building, and if that needs to be changed based on the modern guidance. I think that's really powerful because we're entering an era where buildings will change. The existing buildings will change. Renovation is way more efficient than building new buildings. So we need to use what we have the best we can. And I foresee that this kind of work will be more and more important in the future. So definitely a great skill to acquire. And I also really like the idea of using the Life Quality Index in assessing the benefits of safety solutions. It's a hard choice when you have to calculate how much money you save, how much lives you save, how much life is worth. Very, very difficult things to do. And as Ruben said, in different countries, this will be different. There will be different amount of money people are willing to pay to save one's life. And unfortunately, that is a brutality in which we live in. And yeah, you need to cater these requirements, cater these solutions to the place where they are used. So you serve the people their best. And the use of life quality index seems like a quite unbiased way to measure that. Quite a good escape from this conundrum we have with estimating the value of life or the value of investment in safety. So that was also a good takeaway for me. I hope you've enjoyed the whole episode. I think it was very worthwhile to spend this hour with us. And the discussion was really good. I am certainly going back to it after some time because I need to digest it and maybe implement some of what has been said here in my own work. And anyway, thank you very much for being here. And as usual, next Wednesday, next episode. See you there. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
