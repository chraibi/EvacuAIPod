 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 99. One more to go. Just kidding. No worries, podcast is not going anywhere. I'm just really happy where we got so far. In today's episode, another very well requested topic, a subject that always electrifies the audience, which is electric vehicles in fires. very specific context, that is the context of road tunnels. I cannot tell you how many times I've been asked to what extent the tunnel safety is changed by the introduction of electric vehicles in our fleet. I always had some sort of an answer to that question, but today I might say that I finally have a science-based, peer-reviewed and published answer to that question. And I have invited the researcher behind this answer, Professor Peter Sturm from Graz University in Austria, who for the last years has been really testing electrical vehicle fires in tunnel settings and investigating with his team the consequences, probabilities, risks related to such fires. And this is what's going to be discussed thoroughly today. You'll learn how the playing field changes with the introduction of electric vehicles, why it doesn't change that much in many factors, and why in some factors it is quite different. And more interestingly, we're going to talk not just about the fire emissions, the fire sizes, or the threat that the fires are to the tunnel itself. We're also going to discuss the firefighting techniques and the implications of their findings to the risk and risk analysis. And also how their findings may be extended to things like electrical buses or maybe even other new fuel carriers that are introduced in the fleet. So I think a very interesting subject, very exciting episode. No more need to prolong this introduction anymore. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. This podcast is brought to you in collaboration with OFR Consultants, a multi-award winning independent consultancy dedicated to addressing fire safety challenges. OFR is the UK's leading fire risk consultancy. Its globally established team has developed a reputation for preeminent fire engineering expertise with colleagues working across the world to help protect people, property and planet. OFR is involved in many spectacular projects like the National Portrait Gallery in London. OFR has been involved in this major redevelopment of the landmark building since the earliest concepts in 2018, with the team currently assisting on with the construction stage of the project. The fire strategy needs to use the existing fabric of the building in a sympathetic and pragmatic manner, and as a part of this, working closely with Jamie Forbert, Architects, OFR has assessed over 100 doors in the building to check their suitability as a part of the new fire strategy.

Hello Peter, great to have you in the podcast. Hello, nice that you did have the possibility to speak with you here in this podcast. Thank you. I've reached out to you in the subject of electric vehicles in road tunnels, but for a long time I've knew you and I've attended your conferences in Graz with a very large focus to the fire, ventilation, smoke control in tunnels. And I've received immense value from those. So when I saw that you're also leading research on lithium-ion batteries in tunnels, I knew it's going to be good. So let's dive deeper into your research. So from what I've read, in 2018, you have started a project, a research project, concerning the effects of incidents with battery electric vehicles on tunnel safety, something that we are being asked every tunnel project. I wonder what was the background in 2018, and what was the process leading to emergence of this interesting project? The one thing is clear due to our change in the fleet distribution which we had in Austria but in Europe due to the need of involving more electrical vehicles into the fleet. We had always the rumors that with batteries you have a problem. And everyone who is having a cell phone knows, at least from a couple of years ago, that battery goes warm and sometimes it goes too warm. It starts to burn. And they had some problems, either during charging or whatever. And the car battery is more or less the same. It's just bigger. It's more or less the same. It's a lithium-ion technology. And there was a big concern that if you have such cars, then you might have an increased fire risk. This is one part. The second part is that everyone also knows from battery tests, mainly from the tests of cells of batteries, that as soon as such a battery, at the end it's an accumulator, but we call it battery, such a battery is burning, you have only to wait until it's fully burned. And the extinguishing process is almost impossible. Or you put the whole thing into water. So the problem is really if you have a big unit like a car battery, and this starts to burn, regardless which reason it is, why it starts to burn, why it starts to overheat, then a process like which is called a thermal runaway starts. And that means that you have a self-heating and as soon as you have the thermal runaway triggered, then the battery gets very hot. And after a certain temperature, it starts to burn. The battery gets very hot and after a certain temperature, it starts to burn. And you cannot extinguish this fire from outside. It not easily extinguishes because the oxygen is in the battery. So it burns. And this is the big concern to tunnel operators. What happens if something is in the tunnel? Something that's probably obvious for you, but why in a tunnel setting? Because I see everyone talking about car park and let's say open air problems and your research is very tunnel focused. What made you pursue it in this particular context? Let's start from the open air. If it's in the open air, of course, you have possibilities to escape. You have good ventilation possibilities. You have a good dilution of the pollutants. So if such a car is burning in the open air, then the risk is quite small. And when we speak about cars, we speak about passenger cars currently. Now let's look at the tunnel operators. The tunnel operators will have a lot of such cars in the tunnels, especially in urban areas. The tunnel is in confined space, so dilution is not so easy. And, of course, the escape possibility is already restricted. If we go further down to much more confined spaces like parking garages, then this is a different story, and it showed also the research, and maybe we can speak at the end a little bit about this, that at the end it turned out this is more critical compared to what is going on in a tunnel. But in a tunnel, we have always, let's say, official bodies behind us giving the permission to use the tunnel. And in the tunnel, you have a lot of cars, thousands, ten thousands per day. So you have much more incidents compared to what is going on in a parking garage. And so the risk was assumed to be higher and of more interest for tunnel operators. That's the reason why tunnel operators and here in Austria, the ministry wanted to have some research on this. And I assume because Austria being an alpine country, you have, if I read correctly, 175 tunnel facilities. That's an immense network. And ASFINAG data on probability of fires and incidents in tunnels is very high quality because you have so many tunnels, so many millions of kilometers of vehicles passing through them. I wonder, did you already have electric vehicle fire in tunnel in Austria that you would know about? No, fortunately not. fire in tunnel in Austria that you would know about? No, fortunately not. We had no, not only in Austria, as we are dealing within a group, international group within PIAC with this issue, we made a call all over the world, please report us about incidents with such vehicles in tunnels. And there is fortunately no incident of such vehicles in a tunnel. We had some incidents in Austria close to the portals, mainly because cars crashed into the barriers on the entrance of the portals, and due to the crash, a fire started. And there we had it, but fortunately not in the tunnel. And when you said, okay, if 200 tunnels, these are the tunnels on the highway network. They're very heavily trafficked. But I would have also even more concern. We have a lot of city tunnels, which are not in the highway network. They're very heavily trafficked, but I would have also even more concern we have a lot of city tunnels, which are not in the highway network, but they're heavily crowded, and in cities we have a higher concentration of electric cars currently. Of course, we have still to remember that the share of electric cars, although they are very high in the sales of new ones, but on the road, the share is still very small. That makes sense that in cities you would have more of those inevitably. They will come, definitely. I say it all the time. I'm dealing mainly with car parks, well, with tunnels as well, but a lot with car parks. And they always ask us, do we need to design the car parks for electric vehicles nowadays? And I'm usually responding, like like we do for 30 years. We just didn't know that. It's not our choice what type of energy carrier will be in the tunnel. Now, let's move into your research, the BRAFA project. Maybe you could describe generally what the project was about and what kind of research you pursued in it. And then we would move into the details of the project. Okay. So as there are very few projects on this topic going on all over the world, we tried to cover a huge amount of different things. And this was almost too much because first of all, we from the aerodynamics, thermodynamics of such subsurface infrastructures, we wanted to see how the burning situation is. Road operators and especially fire brigades, which wanted to see how the burning situation is. Road operators and especially fire brigades, which were also contributing to the project, they wanted to see what can they do if a car is burning. So we had two contradicting aspects. We want to have the fire, the other ones want to extinguish the fire. So what was looked at was we looked at the burning situation, we looked at how to extinguish those fires and we looked also on the effects on the structure and for example on the water which is used for extinguishing the fire because you have pollutants, you have additional pollutants, they go into the water. Of course in the tunnel this water is collected. At the end you have to look what is in the water. You have to get rid of it. So it's highly polluted then. So this was the concern. Let's say this was the scope of the project which was very big. But on the other hand, it is very expensive to burn electrical cars. So the amount of cars were at least restricted. Of course, that's a problem we all have in this space. Research on vehicles is prohibitively expensive if you want the whole things. But if I understood correctly, you started with burning like single cells, then moved into burning modules, and then into the whole vehicle in a panel setting. So what was the progress like? In this podcast, we've already talked a lot about the behavior of batteries themselves and what makes them burn. But I wonder, what was the profound difference when you moved from battery pack to a vehicle? Or have you observed no difference? There's no big difference on the burning behavior itself. The problem was a little different one. All the tests up to now, as you said, there's a lot of tests on the cells, on the battery size. They are made in something like sheltered rooms. Also, the car tests, which have been made up to now from the French people, also in the same time there were some Swedish people doing some car tests. They are made in what we call in fire holes. The fire hole is a confined space. You have a good ventilation inside, but you don't have the situation like in a road stamp. Why we started again with battery fires and then to the car fire was a little bit different. We had a different background. We needed to see how the layering of the smoke and the pollutants in the tunnel is, where to put our measurement equipment. Because now, instead of having one well-mixed air mixture where we can do the measurements, we have a cross-section and in each location of the cross-section, you have a different temperature, a different air velocity, a different concentration. So if you want to make a measurement, a reliable measurement of some gases, we should know where the gas is. And that was the reason why we mainly started with the batteries, looking on the batteries of the fire brigades. So the cell level was only to learn a little bit how to ignite fires. And the battery was mainly then, the batteries, it was not one battery which we used. We used a full set of batteries like you have it in a car. So, for example, the full floor plate of a car, but without the car surrounding the whole thing. And we ignited this and also the fire brigade looked a little bit. Can they extinguish it? What can they do if such and such thing burn? Just to learn that the end and batteries were a little bit easier to get. The full vehicle, contrary to, we are used to fire tests. The problem making a fire test of a conventional car, you go on the market, you buy a very old car, which is damaged, or a new car from an accident, and you fill the tank and you burn it. That's no problem. This costs maybe 1,000 or 2,000 euros. But if you go to a battery electrical vehicle, you don't get a battery electrical vehicle from a crash. Even if you get it from a crash, it costs on the market something like 15,000, 20,000 euros. And if you have a new one, then it costs much more. So we have to learn how to ignite them, where to measure best. And so we did it step by step. Actually, this is a type of science that not often is reported, but it kind of is very interesting. So how did you find the best way to ignite those batteries? There is a test which was very easy, where it is very easy to ignite a cell, and this is what is called a nail penetration. You just destroy the battery by a crash. It will be destroyed, and then the separator between the electrodes is destroyed, and then you get a short circuit, and you have a problem with overheating. This works very good for single cells and also for small batteries. And it worked very good for electrical cars up to, I would say, 2010, 2015. Nowadays, the cars have a very good battery management system and a totally different cooling. So we had to try to overheat the batteries. In former years, this was simply possible by overcharging the battery, like it was with a mobile phone. Most of the mobile phone fires started because people were charging, and it was a defect in charging. This could be the same in a car. In the old cars, the overcharging resulted to an overheating, resulted to a fire. Old you mean like 2010, 2015? Yes. So that the first generations of battery life, let's say up to 2010 in this region. But the new ones have a very good battery management system. Overcharging is almost impossible. So we had to use gas flames, so let's say engulfing fires to get the temperature. Engulfing fires are very good for batteries because you directly exhaust the battery. In a car, if you have an engulfing fire, you have the battery sheltered. So even with engulfing fires, then it takes almost 10 minutes, 15 minutes to get the battery burning. So at the engulfing fires, then it takes almost 10 minutes, 15 minutes to get the battery burning. So at the end, we found something different. We flooded the casing of the battery. We opened the casing of the battery and put some acid in it, liquid acid, and then the shortcut started immediately. A short circuit. But this is an extra thing. So the question is always, which source of fire are you expecting? We have two possibilities. Either the fire starts from the batteries, then this flooding the battery with acid or putting some acid in the battery is something like you can simulate this one. The second thing is the fire could start like it is in most cases, also for conventional cars, it starts from a fire in the compartment. A defect, electrical defect, a cable starts to burn or something in the interior of the car starts to burn. And then you get an engulfing fire. The fire comes from the car and goes to the battery. But still, if it's the second way, you would not have an engulfing fire. You would have more like upper exposure from up to down because to have a fire underneath the vehicle, you would have to have a spilled fuel underneath it, which we expect to not have with a battery electric vehicle, right? Yes, this is more or less true, but you have to think you have a car and if it starts, for example, you have it under the hood, the fire, because you have the engine, then you have for example, you have it under the hood, the fire, because we have the engine, then you have the wind, you have turbulence, you have the flames all under the floor plate. But as you correctly said, the protection situation from new cars now is so that these batteries are very well protected and we found, especially with very new cars, that after 10 minutes the car was totally burned out already, and the battery did not start burning. So in this case, we made something artificial to get it burning, because we want to see what happens if it burns. I will just comment that if fire scientists start to struggle igniting these things, it's a sign that things are going in the right way. And that's it. You've also mentioned one important thing that in a ventilation setting, this will look different. And this also distinguishes your experiments in a tunnel from experiments under the hood, where you would have this type of free burn, natural buoyancy driven flow, because you need to capture all the smoke to measure the O2 concentrations to quantify the size of the fire. In your case, because of how experiment is designed, you want to have strong longitudinal flow that controls the smoke in a way, but also changes the dynamic around the car. So have you observed the different outcomes than maybe from the literature? How did your tests look compared to that? Yeah, the big difference to that, if you burn it in a controlled atmosphere and everything is under, let's say, in a room where you have a well mixture at the end where you make the measurements, for us it was very important to see the layering. Like it is in the room, you have the smoke going up. The dynamics of a car fire is so big that even if you have a higher velocity of air which comes to the car, this does not change a lot into the vicinity of the car. But as soon as you are a couple of meters behind the car, you have this wonderful layering like you have it. You are used to have it in a car fire. You have smoke above and you have a good breathable air below. This is the big difference to what, for example, all our other colleagues found. They found, let's say, hydrogen fluoride concentrations in a reasonable amount, but quite below critical values because they mixture the whole air. For ventilation rate, they mixture the whole air with the emitted pollutant so average average value have definite an average over the whole situation and we have different layers and we found of course that as soon as you are if you would be a person with a height of 2.5 meters then you might have problems because at this height above surface level, concentrations are quite high, above critical value. But in your height, let's say 1.80 or 1.60 where you have your breathing situation, the concentrations were lower. So we found it is layering. We found an extreme gradient in concentrations like you expect it from a car fire, passenger car fire. To give a context, how big the facility is, and maybe you can even describe the Zentrum am Berg facility, because I don't think it's widely known in Europe, and I find it super interesting that you have such an amazing place to burn stuff in Austria. So how tall was the tunnel? And then give me the story of Zentrum am Berg, please. Okay, the test facility, as you said already, Zentrum am Berg, is a very, very old open pit mine for iron ore. And in one part of this pit mine, there is a region now dedicated for tests. And there in the mountain, we have tunnels. We have big tunnels, like you have it on the road. Two tunnels have the same profile like a road tunnel. Two other tunnels have the same profile like we have it now for our high-speed rail tunnels. So you have extremely good test facilities for road and rail. Everything is interconnected with cross passages, and everything like it is in a real road tunnel or in a real rail tunnel. And everything is interconnected. So in total, you have roughly three kilometers up to four kilometers subsurface tunnels where you can make tests. It's a huge test facility, not so well known in Europe up to now, but strongly used already from fire brigades for training and from us for research. I absolutely love it. It's a dream come true for any fire scientist to receive such a facility to be able to play with it. The good thing is the ventilation possibilities which we established. One tunnel is like a longitudinal ventilated tunnel. The other one is like it's a transverse ventilated. So with water mist systems and all this stuff. So you can do research like you want as long as you have the money for it. That's the small problem. So we had this 65 square meters cross section, which have 55 to 60, depending on which location you look at in this region. And our ventilation philosophy in Austria and in Switzerland is, in case of a fire, you go with controlled ventilation. That means there's a speed roughly between 1 and 1.5 meters per second. speed roughly between 1 and 1.5 meters per second. And now let's take 65 square meters by 1.5 meters per second. You end up with roughly 100 cubic meters per second dilution ratio. And this is totally different to what you find in fire test houses, because there you have a lowered ventilation rate, but you have a well-mixed situation where you make the measurements. We have a big ventilation rate, but you have a well-mixed situation where you make the measurements. We have a big ventilation rate, but we have the layerings. For example, we cannot use the oxygen method for calculating the heat release rate, because the concentrations from oxygen, the depletion of oxygen is too little. So we need other measures. So it's not so accurate like the oxygen measure, but it's possible to make an estimation on the heat release rate. So it's a huge test facility. You are invited to come in and have a look at it. It sounds so amazing and it's so much closer than the tunnel in Gij√≥n in Spain. It makes it much more realistic because it's in the mountain and not only the inner line that the shell puts somewhere. Well, every two years I'm at your conference in Graz, so that's not very far away. Now, coming back to the electric vehicles, I'm so envious of that tunnel. I would absolutely love such a facility. Now, back to the batteries. So one of the things you've reported in your project that were very interesting to me and quite in line with the literature was the differences you found in NMC, nickel manganese cobalt batteries, versus LFP, that stands for lithium iron phosphate batteries, in terms of their burn behaviors. And from drawings and plots, it seems quite a giant difference. So maybe you can comment on this battery technologies and how that relates actually to real vehicle situation. Nowadays, so the NMC were a little bit earlier. The situation is that the higher the energy density is, unfortunately, the more critical the substances is which you are having at the moment in the batteries so the current technology which we're having the nmc is uh one one one three three three or something like this one is that's the current technology when you burn it you have the problem that you have mainly the fluorides in it the hydrogen fluorides in it the burning behavior is in a way that the thermal, the triggering of the thermal runaway is quite early compared to older batteries. And so that's the reason why we are having this problem. As soon as you have the thermal runaway starts roughly at 110 centigrade, then it goes up a little bit and then it goes and then you cannot stop it anymore as soon as this thermal runaway starts then you have the problem that the batteries or the effects are producing the heat and with the heat you produce the vapors and the vapors after a certain time start to burn but what we found and this is maybe what we are looking at the older technologies where we are looking at there we had a little bit different status of charge. So how much energy is still in the battery is very important. So if you have a battery which is fully loaded, then of course you have a lot of energy in it. And the heat which is released then is very high. So the burning behavior is very strong compared to a battery which has already 30% of loading. So this is the major difference. And all other things, so if you have other battery technologies which do not have such a high energy density, they are not so aggressive in burning situations. And also the lithium-iron phosphate batteries, you found the fire development, it was like measurably slower to reach the full potential, right? Yes, but I have to say we have two things here which is not so clear because the battery technology was a different one and the SOC was a different one. So at the moment, we don't really know what is the major effect. Was it only the status of charge which made this big change or was it all chemical composition? But from other literature it's known that half battery is not so prone to burn. And is this still the ongoing battery technology in electric vehicles or it was already superseded? This is already supers vehicles or it was already superseded? This is already superseded. The speed of development in this field is absolutely astounding. Yes, and it's also a question where you use it. If the batteries are more used on the storage side, then they don't need this high energy density. So then you still have these batteries, so they're not so critical. But if you are on the high end, like we have it now with 100 kilowatt hours or something, in the battery capacity, like we call it, then you have very aggressive batteries. I see. Now let's talk about the outcomes of the fires. So in front of me, I have your paper and I see some interesting things. I have your paper and I see some interesting things. So first of all, the measurements that you've captured in terms of approximating the heat release rate that you've done through the calculating energy balance in your tunnel. It's again a confirmation that these fires are not immensely larger than you could expect from a passenger vehicle fire. So again, let's say up to 10 megawatt size. 10 is already... Ah, it's higher end. Yeah, this is higher end and we are not so sure if we really had the 10. Yeah, it's approximation, of course. What's interesting to me that in one of the tests that you report, you had the fire ongoing, the battery was not catching fire and then you released the acid into the battery to create a short circuit and then you approximated this of like four megawatts from the battery. This is very interesting because, again, it's something I could have expected because a module would be more or less a megawatt. You have multiple modules in the car. Can you comment on this fire growth characteristic, what you've observed? Also in terms of consequences to the tunnel, maybe at this heat release rates, because people also have difficulty in placing, you know, megawatts in context of Celsius in a tunnel. Okay. So first of all, as you said, especially this was the very last test which we made, or one of the last tests which we made, and we had the problem that the battery did not catch the fire from the car. Okay. But as we wanted to, it lasted 10 minutes and so on, and the fire was already going down, and we were afraid that battery will not burn. So then we put this acid in the casing of the battery, and we put a lot of them into the whole thing. So we got a very strong increase because we got an immediate reaction of not one cell, of almost, I would say, half of the cells in the battery. So if we put it into a realistic scenario, it would be like a terrible runaway of the whole thing, like all the cells in the module. So maybe not all, but the majority. So this is really on the very top end. So this is really on the very top end. It was good because we see that, okay, if you're on the top end, what happens? And even if you are on the top end and the whole battery is burning within seconds, starts to burn within seconds, then we found that we are still not very much above a conventional car. And now you ask the most important question is what does it mean for our tunnel? Bad passenger car fire had never a big effect on the tunnel safety, structural safety of the tunnel. Because a tunnel is designed, look at, we have two things where we design a tunnel for. One is the structural situation. The structural situation is designed according to a heat release curve, which is called RWS curve, for example, or the unit temperature curve. So we have temperatures up to 1,200 centigrade on the ceiling for a very long time. And this would correspond to a fire in the range of, if you make a pool fire, then you would need almost a pool fire in the range of almost 200 megawatt. And this is what the structure has to withstand. Of course, then if you have such a fire, you have damages in the way of spalling the concrete and all this stuff. Then you have the second thing, which is the safety systems, ventilation, for example. Ventilation is in most cases designed for heavy duty fires. Heavy duty fires are in the range of 50, 70 megawatt, rarely 100 megawatt. So, and now we are speaking about an electrical car. An electrical car has, let's say, if it has 10 megawatt for a very short time, then it's very high. Normally it has four to six megawatt. So we are far beyond any problem for our safety systems. And the peak temperatures you measure are like 100, maybe 150 degrees. It's like nothing from the perspective of a tunnel, right? So on the ceiling there's nothing. There's high temperatures, nothing. This is the convective temperature. Of course, the radiation is higher, but you can shelter yourself from the radiation very easily by just sheltering your face or just turning around and having your back like in a nice open fire, then you have the same situation. The radiation could be strong or weak, depending on how you look at the fire. The convective part is small. This is not the problem. The problem is more the gases. We've already discussed briefly the toxic products, the hydrofluorides, and the stratification of that. One last thing I wondered about the products. You've also measured the heavy metals released from that. Any interesting findings in that regard? Yeah, the heavy metals. So everything in heavy metals, which we found on the particle side, breathable region, they were not really of concern. The heavy metals were of concern in the water. In the water? Off water. Because you collect the runoff water and then you have to get rid of it in your waste management procedure. And there we found that the heavy metals were much higher compared to our threshold levels. So this is just an aftertreatment then of the runoff water. And of course, if you don't collect the water like in the open road, it could be, then it goes into the ground. But on the walls or in the breathable air, we did not find concentrations of heavy metals in the level where it could be really critical. So an important part of your research was also the firefighting technologies. So if we could briefly touch that, you've compared just soaking it with water, you've used large blankets and you've used the cut lens system, high pressure water to cut things. So maybe you can comment on the effectiveness of these approaches and what your firefighters liked the most. As I told you before, we had always this fight between us and the firefighters. We wanted to extinguish, but then we... And you wanted to burn as long as possible. The ultimate struggle when you do fire research along with firefighters. Yes, we know that very well. But at the end, we find the compromise and said, come on, if you're cold to a fire, it takes at least 10 minutes before you come. And so we had the agreement they will not interact before 10 minutes after the start of the fire. Okay. But currently, of course, water is used to extinguish all fires because it's the most efficient mean. But we know from experience that the water does not come to the battery. So you can put water, whatever you want, on the car. It will not cool enough that the battery fire will be stopped. Of course, there is, you may know, or definitely know, fire brigades have now huge containers where they can even dump the car, especially after they have extinguished it the first time. Then they dump the car. And according to the information from Tesla or from other car manufacturers, e-car manufacturers, they say you need up to 10 cubic meters on water. Normally, you will have four to six cubic meters in a fire break in a car from the fire brigade bringing the water in. And the water that the pumping system, the hydrant system you have, of course, provides you also a lot of water. This would not be the problem. But you don't bring the water to the battery. There's one method now commonly used already for standard car fires. They use such fire blankets. for standard car fires, they use such fire blankets. And the fire blankets, the sense of a fire blanket is you put it over the car and the fire suffocates because the oxygen is gone. There is no new oxygen coming to the whole thing. This works for standard cars without problems. This works for each battery car as long as the battery is not burning. But as soon as the battery is burning, you have the lithium ion. It's an oxide. You have a lot of oxygen in the battery is not burning. But as soon as the battery is burning, you have the lithium ion. It's an oxide. You have a lot of oxygen in the battery. So the battery is self-producing its oxygen. So you can cover it whatever you want. This will not help you. And this was clear from the beginning on, but we had to demonstrate it because there are some nice videos on the internet showing that such a blanket helps even for a battery car. It helps for a battery car, but the battery must not burn. As soon as the battery burns, then it doesn't help you. Had it any beneficial effects on, like, concentration outside, the temperature profile? Of course, yes. Okay. Concentration goes down, the heat release rate goes down, but the blanket was destroyed after two or three minutes. Okay, okay. It was not possible. Normally, the blanket, you should put it on the floor. The fire dynamic is so that the big flames came out from one side. I was really astonished by the people from the fire brigade. They didn't fear the fire at all. So they went into the flames and tried to put the blanket on. So as soon as the battery burns, no. No effect. And if you put it there after one or two minutes, the fire resistant blanket gets holes because it's not working. You can make whatever you do. But there is another, a new method. It's not really new. I think Peugeot or Renault already started a long time ago with the first cars. They provided an opening into the battery casing where fire brigade should put water directly into the battery casing. But of course, if you have a fire of the vehicle, then you cannot go to this opening and look where the opening is. And now some companies produced a system like a lens where you can penetrate the casing of the battery. But in case you have to come to the car, you have to take this lens and penetrate the casing of the battery, which is the full floor plate of a passenger car. So you will find a place where to penetrate it. And then you can put water directly into this casing. And then you can put water directly into this casing. And then instead of using 10 cubic meters, less than 100 liters. Let's say the volume of the battery, which is a couple of hundred liters, make maximum is sufficient to cool it down. So for my listeners who may not be that familiar with firefighting techniques, CatLance is a tool that can even penetrate a 20 cm concrete wall. It's amazing. It's very high pressure water. The same principle that you use in water cutting machines to cut literally anything. There's YouTube series with people cutting items and they have like billions of views. So if you want to get familiarized with the technology go YouTube and write what they're cutting but in firefighting the principle is you put this lens against an object and it the water will eventually cut through the object and flow inside that's very basic and here you basically cut through the exterior of the vehicle to reach directly the back in your tests the battery. In your tests, the battery was already fully engulfed. Have you done any tests in non-complete exposed batteries? I was wondering, because if you cut with this water, you inevitably will create short circuits and may even grow the fire. But again, you will cool it immediately after you do that, right? This was one of the big concerns of the fire brigades having shortcuts. Okay. But this is, at least here in Austria, or in Austria-Germany, we have two systems. One is really a lens which you throw into the whole thing. So you really make it mechanically that you destroy the cover or the compartment of the battery. But if you think from an electrical point of view where can you have the shortcut the shortcut comes from the battery and then if you would throw a metal or even a water into the the whole thing then it has to go back to the fireman but in between is in most cases the casing of the battery so before the electric so you you get a shortcut in all cases between the battery and the casing of the battery, which is of metal. So there is no possibility to get it out of the casing. It's like a Faraday cage. Like a Faraday cage. So it's kept inside. So this is one thing we found with one manual activation. There's another possibility that they have made it now automated by hydraulic oil. They put it under the car, and so it's far away from the fire brigade. You have only the pipe in between. No one touches the whole thing. But the people from the fire brigade were strongly concerned about this issue, but they were convinced, and it could be shown that the shortcut was not, a short circuit, sorry, a short circuit was not an issue in this case. Fantastic. I love how these technologies develop. And I mean, this one actually looks very promising. I must say, I see some development in blankets as well, potentially as a health tool in addition. And there's a lot of technologies where you can maybe flood the battery in total, like move the car and flood it. But this cut lens seems really the least effort and the least water you need to really get rid of the battery fire problem. To move to the final parts of your report, there are two things that I would love to talk, risk assessment and larger vehicles. So for risk assessment, I guess we can cover it very quickly. I will just read a bullet point from your paper because it really summarizes well and to the point. The results from these tests have also become a part of risk assessment studies for Austrian tunnels. The results showed that even strong increase in battery electric vehicles in tunnels will not require any significant change in the current Austrian tunnel safety standards. Yes. So again, we are speaking about two things here. One is the cars. If you replace the cars by battery electric cars, a strong increase up to 20-30% in the fleet. The problem, the comment is quite simple. First of all, in Austrian tunnels and in most European tunnels, the risk is dominated by an incident not resulting in a fight. So more than 95% of the risk is driven by this mechanical incidence. And this is by historical data. We have this very huge database from Aspen, which is really good. But it's now a European requirement that you collect this data. So it's all over Europe with the data which is here. So most of the incidents resulting in mechanical damage, especially if you have fatalities, if you have dead people. So the second issue is now, if you have now a vehicle which after the incident starts and it starts to burn, then you have to look at the effects. And now we learn from these tests, a passenger car has a negative effect on the hydrogen fluoride, but the ventilation helps us to keep it down. This might be different with buses. So in this risk assessment, also the buses have been replaced by electrical buses. Of course, this depends if you go on the highways in Austria, the possibility of having coaches with electric engines and batteries is quite small. This would be more for urban tunnels. Urban tunnels, you might have a higher share of electrical buses, but even there, the probability is so small that the change is neglectable. So it's not a question of the effect, it's a question of the probability, the frequency, the probability. We have so little of them compared to the other cars and the number of incidents which have been reported with buses are so small that any change here is, with buses are so small that any change here is, I think it was a few percent, where the risk is a little bit higher. So this is not a big change. What we found from the simulations from the buses is that in a bus, you have a different, and you have also maybe more problems with engulfing fires because the battery is not on the floor. It will be in the ceiling. Okay. It will be in the ceiling. Okay. It will be above the bus. So you have a very short distance to the tunnel walls, especially if you have it cut and cover, a rectangular profile. And then the temperature is very high. So it will result in extreme spalling. So here we have the requirements from our civil engineers, unified temperature curves. They will be met. So this is really the battery electrical vehicles, the buses. They will really be strongly contributing to heat problems in tunnels and to spalling if something burns. And the concerns of the bus manufacturers is what happens if it burns there and you have the heat radiation down to the passengers if you cannot evacuate them early enough. But this might change also a little bit the situation with battery-electrical buses in city tunnels, not so strongly in highway tunnels where the share is so small. Of course, the effect could be high, but the probability is very low. This is always the question of risk assessment. You can have one effect, which has almost a very awful negative effect, or one incident with negative effects, but if the probability is so low, the overall risk is still low. So let me summarize it in one sentence. Passenger cars were never an issue and the electric vehicles are no different. And now the interesting question because you said you've done simulations on trucks. What happens if we get electric trucks in our tunnels? Does this change the thing? Yeah, it's again a question of the capacity. So I think it's more a question of the electric buses because the buses are on top. It might more a question of the electric buses because the buses are on top. It might change a little bit the situation concerning the gases. We expect that the amount of hydrogen fluoride is much higher. But again, we have to know the burning behavior of these batteries because if the battery of a bus is only much bigger compared to the battery of a passenger car. So now it's a question how the burning behavior is. If it's burning cell by cell, then it lasts only longer. And so then there's no big change in concentrations because we have a constant volume flow, a constant emission rate, concentration is constant. But if we have a higher burning rate and a higher release per second of hydrogen fluoride, and this is something which we don't know at the moment, then it could be more critical. The good thing again, it's on the ceiling, and it's again the good thing, for example, we most of the central European countries are using controlled velocity in case of a fire and not critical velocity. Because in a city tunnel where you have congestions, then with critical velocity, you destroy each layering of the smoke. While with controlled velocity, you might keep some layering. It's not for sure, but the probability is higher that the layering is still here. So as long as you can keep the gases on higher levels, the risk is reduced for the tunnel users. So with goods vehicle, I guess again, it's more about what they're carrying on the trailer, not necessarily the vehicle itself. I don't think so. It's an important discussion, you know, because as a scientist, as a fire scientist, we may intuitively think that it's the case. But again, our governments, our authorities, they are just concerned with what they see on the television. And what they see is that electric vehicles are going to kill us all. So that's clear. But for the heavy duties, I think even with the current technology, where might you have a heavy duty? This is in cities for smaller cars, but not for the long haul cars with the heavy weights. So for a 40 ton long haul heavy duty, I don't think that this will be a battery electrical vehicle. If electricity is coming, it's more an electrical road system or maybe it's more on the LNG side or on the syn-fuel side, but definitely not on an electrical side. Because with the current battery technology, you would need an extra tender to carry the batteries. And most probably there will not be a buff. There will be again on lower parts of the car. Because if you have it on the ceiling, you know the driving situation, the whole situation of the car, the stability of the car is less. So to finish this up, I want this to be useful to engineers, and on the same time, I'm maybe not so comfortable if engineers cite podcast episodes as the source of ultimate knowledge. I know you are producing some very interesting resources. Was it in World Channeling Association or PIAC or both? It's just reported in PIAC and in other like ITA and all this stuff. So it's reported there and it's used. There's a report now coming up from PIAC dealing with the new energy carriers, impact of new energy carriers on road transport and then tunnel safety. But this is, of course, also dealing with LNG, CNG, or hydrogen cars. But the knowledge which we are currently having on, for example, hydrogen cars, fuel-selected vehicles or something like this one, or LNG, is much smaller compared to what we have at the battery cars. Really? Yeah, because they are just coming. And this is more than a question of how we can make the tank safe. If you speak about hydrogen or LNG or CNG, high pressure CNG, then it's a question of you have to avoid tank rupture, for example, because a tank rupture could result in catastrophic events in a tunnel. All the other things like jet flames and this stuff, this is not via release of the gas, via the pressure relief waves. This is not critical. There is already literature about this. This is not so critical. But a tank rupture must be avoided anyway. Very, very interesting. So this is coming when? You mentioned October at Prague, a grand premiere of this report. Fantastic. Should be available at that time. It will be available through PR, the usual way as PR shows everything. Fantastic. If people in the audience do not know that, I will link you to PIARC in my show notes of the episode, because PIARC is the source of absolutely gold resources in tunnel safety, the methods of calculation, the statistics, emissions, road to tunnel accidents, manual safety. It's a fantastic source of resources if you're in this space. And if you are in this space and you don't know that, I would be actually quite surprised because it's difficult to design anything without PIARC data. actually quite surprised because it's difficult to design anything without PIARC data. And as soon as this report comes up, you will be able to cite it and then comfortably design tunneling spaces with this knowledge. Peter, thank you very much for coming and sharing all of this insight with my audience. It was a great discussion. Maybe you have like final own findings. Was there anything that surprised you when doing this research for all these years? Like what was like the thing that went completely different than you thought it would go? This is a very good question. The thing which went totally different is, for example, what really surprised is that the safety of the batteries has increased in the last two, three years tremendously. So we were really naive when we thought we can ignite a battery very simply by a nail penetration and everything will run. This is not really going on anymore. But this would be the most reasons of fires. You have a crash and then you have a damage of the battery. And then it might be that after 10 minutes, 15 minutes, the battery starts to burn. So here the reduction is quite big, the reduction of such a possibility. And also was a little bit, what would be strongly astonished was we have been working with fire brigades for a long time, fire tests, but the quality of the persons and the ability to fight fires is extremely high. And it's not only the well-trained professional ones. We are also working with volunteer fire brigades. And this is something which also surprised me very strongly, that the willingness to do something is very big and also the knowledge how to approach such a thing. The ability to run into fire is astounding. Yeah, it's really astonishing. Of course, the technique has improved. But there's one thing which maybe you just touched at the beginning which I want to mention, is going back to concentrations. It's the dilution ratio which is important. And this brings me back to parking garages or something. If you don't have a sufficient dilution ratio, then you have to try to get the people immediately out of the garage because otherwise it's really critical. This is something which has to be really taken into the mind. If you construct, let's say, loading stations in the garage, they should be the most prominent place where you can get rid of the smoke and not of the most convenient for the users. So there should be some rethinking, I would say. Yeah, the issue of placing them next to evacuation exits, especially with your one and single only evacuation exit. And it's not even about hydrogen and fluoride itself. If you get a jet fire that actually shoots directly to the evacuation door, it's a lost case anyway. Very thankful for these words. And car park design is something we also discuss here heavily and we will discuss in future. Because playing field is changing very, very quickly with these new energy carriers. And my last message, you know, to the manufacturers. energy carriers. And my last message, you know, to the manufacturers. So, dear car manufacturers, as you see, fire scientists start to see the effects of your hard work on improving safety of your systems. So, if you would be kind enough to give us some newest vehicles to burn, we would very appreciate it and maybe show and report your improvements at a higher pace, not when we have to buy them after 10 years of years. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Peter. And that's it. Thank you for listening. Thank you, Peter, for coming to the Fire Science Show to tell about your recent fire experiments, including electric vehicles in tunnels. A conclusion that could have been expected. Passenger vehicles were never an important risk factor in road tunnels. I mean, we're designing the tunnels for much, much worse scenarios than firing a passenger vehicle. And in the end, the passenger vehicles are not that much different, whether the source of the power in the car is electric or combustion engine. of the power in the car is electric or combustion engine. Now, interesting things between the lines is that, first of all, it starts to become increasingly difficult to ignite those electric vehicles. That's actually a good outcome. And if we struggle to ignite them, you may start thinking that they are really becoming much more fire safe than five or ten years ago. That's a brilliant development in this space and congratulations to the car and battery manufacturers on improving their technologies. So they can accommodate more failure and they're less prone to spread the fires. Another thing is that even if we introduce very big potent sources of fire, such as electric buses, with potentially quite severe consequences, the probability of events is very low, so the risk does not change that much. Interesting concept in the world of risk, that you can have a very high damage event, but if its probability is very, very low, you don't bother with that that much. And this is why I really love working with risk. Otherwise, you end up trying to prevent any possible scenario and at some point you just reach a wall where no more safety features can be featured and you still aren't able to cope with this giant threat. So I'm a huge fan and a huge advocate of risk-based fire engineering and this thinking that Professor Sturm has shown, very common to tunnel engineers, is something very close to my heart. So that would be my two most significant takeaways from this episode outside of the main conclusion. I hope you found your own takeaways and I hope you've got a lot of value from this episode. I hope you've enjoyed it. And as always, next week, another episode full of value is waiting for you episode 100 wow that's the number i'm really happy we've reached this point and and we will continue onwards after that every wednesday see you here at the fire science show thank you bye this was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
