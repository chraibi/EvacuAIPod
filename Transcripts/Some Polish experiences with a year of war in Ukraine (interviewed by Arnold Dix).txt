 Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody. It's Arnold Dix here. I've just stormed the studio here at the Fire Science Show here in downtown Warsaw in Poland. I've grabbed the main producer. Wojciech, that's you, isn't it? I've never seen you before in person. I'm here to liberate you. Thank you very much. What the hell is going on here? I'm here in Warsaw, right? I'm here in Poland. Welcome. I've stormed this amazing studio of yours. I got through the security. I managed to navigate the labyrinths, got through those. Those fire challenges were pretty interesting. Lost a lot of facial hair in there. Thank you very much. That's how I lost my hair. Yeah, that's how you lost it. Oh my goodness. But there's something amazing happening here in Poland and I didn't know and that's why I've hijacked the studio, hijacked you, hijacked your show. I come to Poland for a tunnel conference and I discover Poland now has two languages. What is going on? It's not only two languages, two sorts of registrations on the cars, two sorts of languages spoken in the workplace, two lots of languages in the schools. I can't believe what I'm seeing. What is going on? I'm coming here to liberate you and I find a very happy, contented country behaving in a way I've never seen before. And to think about it, a lot has changed over the last year in Poland. Literally a year ago, we were living our lives normally, enjoying our lives, being annoyed by the governments and stuff like that. All the normal stuff. Building our tunnels, doing our fire safety. Nice tunnels. Nice tunnels, thank you. And then in the neighboring country, you would not believe that. No one here would that it's a real threat, but in the neighboring country, which could as well be us, we are very aware it could have been us, there is suddenly a war, like a real war. People murdering each other, people killing, destroying buildings, cities, houses. It's literally happening overnight. And the day that war started in Ukraine, you could feel it in Poland very much, that it has just happened. It was insane. I think it was like a Thursday or something. I remember I woke up and I see Bitcoin crashed by like 30% and like, okay, they've attacked. That was like my first, I didn't open news stations, nothing. I just saw the crypto market falling down and I understood that something's big happening in the world. And then we see the scale of the war. It's like a real war. It's not like someone attacked a building or a city. On the all ends of the neighboring country, there's like tanks and soldiers swarming in, going like 50 kilometers per hour into the country. So very soon, we realized that these people need help. Then the next day, they start to show up on the border. This is why I've stormed your building. This is the amazing thing that I've found here, and I couldn't have even prepared myself for what I find. This wave of human beings coming across your border, and we're talking millions. Let's get the decimal point in the right spot like six digit millions yeah and the response here tell me the response because my like talk to me about this yeah yeah i i remember it very well like actually during that time for like two or three weeks i haven't done any significant work at my office and i don't think many people did any significant thing. We were seriously worried about the nation of Ukraine. On the first day, it looked like they will be absolutely overwhelmed by the Russian forces. It looked like that. It's going to end up two, three days. They were going so quickly. Very quickly there was this encouraging stories how Ukrainians battle. And Poland is a country that has not existed for 123 years in the 19th century. There was no Poland. It was split between Prussia, Russia and Austria. But there was a time you had a king. And there was the kingdom of Poland. We had the Hussars. The history of Poland is amazing, actually. We were invaded by every single neighbour, Sweden including. And then me, earlier today, to capture you in the studio. You going into this nice tradition of invading us. Thank you, Arnold. Very appreciated. Australians have not invaded us yet. I captured you, only to find... You were very happy, actually. Yeah. You offered me a mineral water and a chocolate. Not very resisting this thing. But yeah, we had a history of uprising against oppressors, you know, standing up, fighting for... Even in the Second World War, when Warsaw was taken hostage by Germans for like five years, 1944, people stood up and battled them, even though there was like no hope, but still people stood up. So I think it's somewhere in the DNA that we feel a lot of respect to those who fight for themselves. And when we say Ukrainians pick up a fight, it was how can we as a nation help them? No, it was not as a nation, you know. And I think it was very natural. Every person for themselves thought how can they help them. No, it was not as a nation. I think it was very natural. Every person for themselves thought, how can they help it? And it was so unanimous. Well, this is what is really sort of both confusing and impressing me. I don't see any evidence of, there's no laws being passed. There's no policy being stated. There was nothing. It's just everyone kind of got on the train. Yeah. Everyone was saying the war is about to stop. Like, you read internet. There was CIA reports they are going to attack. But we were like, nah, they're not going to attack Ukraine. I mean, it's a large independent country. Like, we seem to be living in a world where large, democratic countries do not invade each other. This is the middle of Europe. Like, not to say anything wrong about the rest of the world, but it's a crazy concept that a neighboring country can literally invade you like 100 years ago. We're living in an economically connected world in which such a thing should not be possible. How is it possible that a country can attack another one and have no consequences if they win? That's ridiculous. But we didn't think it's possible, but it happened. Then we see the bravery of Ukrainian people standing arms against Russians. Their bravery, and especially the bravery of people in Kiev, the President Zelensky, that was the most impressive, seriously, when we saw that they are not escaping. They choose to pick, fight, and die rather than escape or surrender. And that was the most impressive. And then I think a lot of people understood that as they are fighting, there's very limited things we can do. Like we are not allowed to send troops inside for various reasons. We don't want to end the world in nuclear apocalypse. So that's not nice, probably. Which I was lucky when I invited your office before. Yeah. There seems to be a lot of people escaping. It's important to understand that Ukrainians were not only escaping to Poland, but there was insane internal migration. I think, if I'm not wrong, 13 million people have migrated inside Ukraine itself. And some of them, like two, two and a half million, escaped to Poland. So much more of them has moved internally which means that in the cities on the west of ukraine where the eastern ukrainians were escaping to it became super crowded it became difficult to get food it became very expensive to find a place to stay it's it even though they were escaping within the country it was not as simple as okay i'm just gonna go to a different i'm gonna go from melbourne to perth and i'm going to be good. No, it's not like that. It was very difficult. So many of them chose, okay, we need to escape outside because it looked like the Russians may win. Can I just stop you there? What I didn't realize until I was here is you don't speak the same language. No, we don't even have the same alphabet. Yeah. So it's not like they're your neighbours. Like in Australia, for example, if there was going to be a war, probably between Victoria and New South Wales, just because they all hate each other, especially since COVID. And I'm sort of joking, but at least we speak the same language almost, although one plays rugby more than the other one plays a different form of football. But here we're talking about different alphabet, different language. Different culture. Different culture. Different religion. Oh, religion too. Yeah, it's Orthodox. In Ukraine, you have two types of Orthodox churches. One is Russian Orthodox Church and the other is Ukrainian Orthodox Church. In Poland, we're Roman Catholics. So we have Pope, they have the, whoever is in the head of the Orthodox Church, it's a different church. They have Christmas two weeks after us. It's good for the kids, I suppose, if they're in a mixed family now. They get lots of presents. I guess, I guess. So there's a lot of differences. Though, I must say that for at least the last, maybe even a decade, we had really a lot of hard-working Ukrainian people coming to Poland to work for at least 10 years. Around 2004, when Poland joined the EU, a lot of us moved to the West for a better life, then eventually came back to Poland. Thank you, UK, Brexit. Thank you, UK, for making this decision much easier for many of the people. But we had a lot of Ukrainians, especially in the construction market. I think at some point there was one and a half, maybe two million workers from Ukraine in Poland already, already assimilating learning language. Through this, we've learned that the barriers are not that huge. Ukrainians fairly easily pick up Polish language. They're very hardworking people, and we respect that. They were respectful to us. It was like nice coexistence, plus they were building our economy, which is very, very great. So we had a lot of them in Poland. Now, when the war started, there became a huge wave of people coming into Poland, women and a wave of working men from Poland moving to Ukraine. They were choosing to come back to their country to defend. It was like, imagine you are, your country is being invaded and is in a war and literally is under the danger of extinction. literally is under the danger of extinction, you are in a very safe place and you choose to cross the border to your own home to protect it. This is a kind of bravery that I don't imagine I would ever be capable of. And yet it was thousands of people. There was like one stream of people escaping Ukraine to Poland and a stream of Ukrainians working in Poland going that direction. This almost caused a collapse to Polish construction markets, because many of the construction works have been severely slowed down because of the lack of personnel. But no one blamed them. Many companies were paying them like three months ahead, so they have money to go there and fight. And whenever you come back, you're very welcome to do so. I think that's something that also missed by the Western media. I would really love to recognize the bravery of Ukrainian people, because what they've done by standing up and protecting their homeland, I don't think anyone expected them to do that. And to Polish people, this is the sign of the biggest respect you can have. This respect, again, this has come as a huge surprise. I mean, I've just turned up here. I'm coming to a tunnel meeting. You know me. I love there's a tunnel meeting. I'm heading to it. So I find myself here. And this mutual respect is something that really strikes me. There's like a harmony here that I didn't expect to see. Like in the streets, I don't see any trouble. When I'm in the center of the town, there's not Ukrainian people begging for money or people looking like they're homeless. Nothing. No, they've been taken care of. That's kind of amazing. There's not Ukrainian people begging for money or people looking like they're homeless. Nothing like that. No, they've been taken care of. That's kind of amazing. It was something. In one way, it was the first days of war. Literally, we're talking about the war started on Thursday. On Monday, we were already organized on the nationwide support. Before our government even had the chance to react in terms of some decisions at the highest ground, there were already thousands of people self-organizing themselves. This is, again, I'm shocked, amazed, what have you. It's like an organic thing. Yeah. People just churning out. Yeah. And it was very interesting that time. And I think many people have immediately considered, OK, I have a second flat that I'm not using. I can lend it to some refugees. Then some people thought, OK, I am incapable of hosting a Ukrainian family, but maybe we can support them by providing clothes, food, whatever else. A lot of people went to do voluntary work at the border crossings. So the border crossings were troublesome. At the peak time, it took one day wait time to cross the border, even though they've maximized the flow to it, because there was literally millions of people walking through the border so you had whenever some and on on the ukrainian side of the border it was much tougher so whenever someone crossed they received immediately food shelter whatever they needed on the polish side then they were distributed like where do you want to go you want to go to warsaw krakow gdansk roslav there was buses you could there. There was a lot of people with their private vehicles, just driving. I have five spots for Warsaw, anyone want to go to Warsaw? Okay, let's go. There were a lot of Polish people who would even drive into Ukraine, which was in the war. People were driving into Ukraine, like to Lviv, 50 kilometers from Polish border, to pick people at Lviv and drive with them to Poland. That was amazing. I heard like text, like almost like text messages, old lady on the corner at such and such with dog. Yeah. Can anyone help? Like this real basic. Then there would immediately be response, okay, I'll pick her up. There would be immediately someone who would go for her. It was astounding how this response, you know, we have scouts in Poland. These organizations were very, very helpful, very quickly organized help. They were handling borders. In Warsaw, we had firefighters who were handling the main train station. They were handling the traffic there. The main train station at some point was just a huge refugee distribution center. Immediately, there was support centers popping in. In Warsaw, there was like 20 of them. I've been to many of them with my Ukrainian refugees, which what it means it was my refugees. I'll tell you a little later. But there was like places where people could just go give clothes, food, medicine, whatever was needed. And even Ukrainian refugees showed up and said, OK, hey, I just came from Ukraine. I need something. They would immediately receive help. There would be someone who would pick them up, walk through there. It was like giant stores with everything for free. You need this, this, this. OK, take it from here, from here, from here. And if you need this this this okay take it from here from here from here and if you need anything else just come back and we'll give it to you by the way there's free food there if you need food and if you need shower it's possible to do it in here or here or here it was amazing there was large little later a large centers were set up in sports arenas, in large empty warehouses. It was a giant, massive center outside Warsaw. It was called the train station Europe. And there went people who came to Poland as a transit point, and they wanted to go to Germany, Sweden, UK, wherever. So they would go their way, then there were buses going to other directions in Europe, and then redistributing them, if I may, into the rest of Europe. But most of them waited in Poland because it was literally women and children with their husbands left in Ukraine. So from Poland, it's fairly easy to come back to Ukraine. So it's short travel. So many of them would choose to stay in Poland. And as you said, many of them would choose it for to stay in Poland. And as you said, many of them would communicate through text message. It was set up like there was a lot of Facebook channels where people would be coordinating that. So whenever people who were willing to take refugees to their homes or were capable of rent a house or a flat or something else to the refugee. They would gather in Facebook pages. Eventually, there was some city planning where the city took, like Warsaw City, took the care of coordinating that in Warsaw. So there would be people who knew what is the base of the flats available. They would get a contact to the Ukrainian refugee who's seeking shelter. And this could happen when they were traveling to Poland. Actually, the family that we have hosted, they were on the bus to Poland when they have connected with us through a coordinator. And they're actually sleeping in your house now. No, that's much better. It's much, much better. I'll tell you how we sold them. But when they were coming to Poland, they had no idea who we are. We had no idea who they are. The only thing I knew is that there's a guy, lady, and a child. And the guy had a PhD in construction. So I'm in the Building Research Institute. So I knew, okay, if the guy is in the construction industry, I told that to coordinators, by the way, that I can immediately give job to a person who's anywhere related to construction industry and science because I have my grants. I have some sorts of funds. I have discussed that internally with my bosses and they were like immediately, yeah, sure, full green. Polish Academy of Science was organizing help. Like for scientists, the scientific committee of Poland was handling the scientific committee of Ukraine. You could immediately get hired in any Polish scientific unit you wanted. So we knew that the guy has PhD in construction. So I said, okay, we can take him. So my family situation, I have four children. I have a wife. We're living in a three-bedroom house, a flat actually. So we chose, okay, we can give them our bedroom because our bedroom has a separate bathroom, so it's like quite a private part of the apartment. And we will live on the couch for the time being. So it's only going to be four children for you, not five. Yeah. Well, yeah. So they came to us and they stayed with us for, I think, three, maybe four months. It was great, by the way. It was a really great time, and I think it was an important lesson for the children to‚Ä¶ Yeah, the kids, how old are your kids? How did they‚Ä¶ They loved it. I have three daughters and a son, and the Ukrainians come with a son, Roma. Roma was a similar age of my son, so they mostly played console games, and my son was absolutely delighted with the fact that he has now a friend at house that he can spend playing video games all the time. So was the Ukrainian boy, his mother not so much. But we're still very much in touch, and they visit us all the time, and it's great, it's like a friendship now. And the doctor, Zhenya, is still working with me. I gave him a job, and he's still working at ITB doing amazing stuff. You would not believe the graphics he's making for us. He's such a great help for the office. He's designing our experiments. We finally have someone who can properly do mechanical design of the structures we intend to build. So actually, it turned out amazing. I would not be able to hire such a specialist from Poland, I think. So I'm happy to have him in here. The important thing was that we knew that we can give them work. That was our goal. Me and my friend Grzegorz, we thought, okay, we can give people work. And by giving them work, well, okay, we can give people work. And by giving them work, by giving them a way to earn money in this situation, you're literally giving them freedom because they can do whatever they like. If they feel like they want to move to Germany, they have funds to go there. If they want to stay in Warsaw, they have funds to support themselves, their family, and outstay the war. If they want to stay here for the rest of their lives because they choose Poland as their new home, fine. They're very well set up for a nice start in here. So I think that was, you saw that on the forums and on Facebook, like very quickly, the Polish law has adjusted to accommodate the situation. So very quickly they've installed a refundation for having Ukrainians in your home. So the country would give you some money for their management. And that lasted for like four months. So that was very helpful. But it's not why anyone did it. Because it happened already. There were already two million refugees at houses. Like literally there was no refugee camps outside of these small camps in which people were. But it was not like these refugee camps and you live there now. No, it was like one, two nights until we sought out something for you. Get your job. Get your job. People that came to us, I don't remember what day of week it was, but I think it was Tuesday. So they came to us on Tuesday. On Thursday already the boy was going to a school in Poland. So this going to a school in Poland, 48 hours after arriving, already at your house, in your bedroom, with the en suite, you're on the couch. Yeah. School. I house, in your bedroom, with the en suite, you're on the couch. Yeah. School. I presume he's got a school ID and everything. It's all... They were, as we like to say, handled. They had everything sorted. The lady did a lot of work with the Ukrainian community, and she's still working with the Ukrainian community, like helping the people manage the situation in Ukraine. It was also like you said, the language barrier exists. That was very difficult. We needed a lot of people who were speaking Ukrainian language because we don't understand them that much. I mean, at some point you start to understand, but immediately it's not so easy. So a lot of those Ukrainians who I said that were working in Poland for years, they suddenly became a huge mass of translators who were everywhere. If you needed to talk to Ukraine, there was always someone who could translate in those larger places. So it was kind of amazing. It was like, it's rough to say, but it was a nice time. It was a great time to be a human, I would say. There's a reason I've come and pushed down the door of your studio and all the rest of it. Is it such a human reaction? It's, for me, is really uncommon. Now, as to where I've been and, you know, my life so far and everything, all I can say is I've been in other countries at times of conflict and I've seen the reaction. And it's not this. It's not this. This is something really extraordinary. I'm walking in your streets and it's not this. It's not this. This is something really extraordinary. I'm walking in your streets and there's harmony out there. It's like you've got two countries and they've blended. And it's just, yeah, I'm just amazed. That's why I'm talking to you about this. And you know what makes this even more amazing? Is there is some very difficult history between Poland and Ukraine. is there is some very difficult history between Poland and Ukraine. So during the Second World War, there was a time, like Ukraine was historically, or a large chunk of Ukraine, were parts of Poland or Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a large chunk, like Lw√≥w, the city in Ukraine. It was a Polish city for like 900 years. It was as Polish as Krakow is. Famous Polish mathematicians came from Lw√≥w, the city in Ukraine. It was a Polish city for like 900 years. It was as Polish as Krakow is. Famous Polish mathematicians came from Lw√≥w. This was a part of Poland. And the history goes like a thousand years before. There was, Kiev was at some point a Polish town. Whether we conquered it or by friendship, I didn't know that. But there was a mutual history. There was also times where Polish in medieval times, let's say, or maybe the 17th, 18th century, Polish aristocracy would abuse the Ukrainian peasants and the Ukrainian crown. I don't think they considered it as a Ukraine or something. I think our modern concept of countries having borders many years ago, I don't think it was that rigid. The country was what you have conquered at this particular point of time, and it was very fluid. But there was a time where I think the Ukraine, and I'm not a historian, so maybe you should find more credible source, but I think there was a time where Polish aristocracy was very abusive towards Ukrainians. And when Ukrainians had a chance to gain sovereignty, they formed some sort of their local army. And there was a story of a large manslaughter of Polish people by Ukrainians on a very large scale. Hundreds, many thousands of people have died in death. Actually, a family of my wife's father has, just a little part of that family survived this manslaughter. So, and it's quite fresh. It's like some people who remember that still live. So, now with the Russian propaganda, they were really heating up this hatred between the nations. Like, how can you like Ukrainians? You don't remember Volyn? They murdered hundreds of thousands of Polish people. They hate you. And this was the agenda on media. Kremlin is using money to fuel conflict all over the world. They pay people to keep this hatred over Internet. You know, it's ongoing. So the state was, in Poland, was quite, the more they prepared for invasion, the stronger this was in Poland. And also the second thing, a few months before the conflict happened, there was an immigrant crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border. So we built a fence. It was ridiculous. crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border. So we've built a fan. It was ridiculous. They were transferring people from Afghanistan to Belarus to send them to Poland. So they amassed conflicts in here because Poland was not very friendly towards migrants from this part of the world. So Poland was a very torn country when the war happened, and I think that's what the enemy expected. But the day the war started, it's like, it switched. Everything was forgotten. It just helped them. It was not just like, these nice people, I always liked them. We need to help them. No, it was like, shit, they're invaded. We need to help them. And everything that stood between us suddenly became non-important at all. So your wife's family that have the memory of these bad times, they're okay? Yeah. Yeah, it's cool. So my impression, because the reason I've come and I've talked to you is I'm just in a state of shock at what I've found because I just didn't expect it to be like this. If I would travel in time, I would not have expected it either, being part of that. Seriously, it's nice. It's a good time to be human. Yeah, it is. It's a very human, nice, friendly feeling here. It's a very compassionate feeling here. I think even here at the hotel, I get the feeling a lot of the staff here might be Ukrainian. You know the ones that... Most likely, yeah. They're not speaking English, which, that's okay. They're working merrily, tell me. Many of them don't speak Polish either, and that's still okay. It still works. So, eventually, after some time into the war, a lot of stuff has been sorted in Poland through legislation. Like they can receive our PESEL name. It's a Polish ID number, like Social Security in the U.S. So when you have this number, it's basically like if you're a citizen. You have free health care and everything. Education. For children, it was immediate. Like literally days. In my school, where my children are attending, they even hired Ukrainian personnel to help communicate with Ukrainian children who are attending lessons with Polish children. That was amazing. It's not like months after. It was days. That was amazing. It's not like months after, it was days. Days after the war started and as they became coming to Poland, immediately this was set in place so these children can continue their education. Healthcare sold it out. They had access to healthcare as much as Polish people. I can tell you they were surprised they can go to a doctor in Poland because Ukraine was a fairly corrupt country. In Ukraine, they sometimes had harder access to healthcare than in Poland. It also caused some funny times where, for example, in Poland, it's very difficult to buy antibiotics. You need to have a prescription from your doctor in Ukraine. They told me, they just go to shop and they just buy it. And I'm like, oh, you can't do that in Poland. So you know, these funny cultural differences in approaches that they were popping out. For us as a family hosting these Ukrainians, we found that we have completely different cuisines, different styles of food. And it was very interesting to try out their foods. They were happy with our it was interesting to discover that even though they live so close it's very different you know hadn't even thought of that yeah so different language different alphabet different food different religion yeah and they're fitting in yeah they're just like they're just living here and then it's it's okay if they want to come back they're welcome to come back to ukraine as when it's safe uh well if they want to come back. They're welcome to come back to Ukraine when it's safe. If they want to stay, they're very welcome to stay as long as they want. Now, first, Ukraine needs to win the war to end this. There's no other ending to this story than Ukraine winning. I cannot see if Ukraine loses this war after all of this. It's going to be horrible. I cannot even imagine that. They will be annihilated. They will be destroyed as a country, as people. That's what's already happening in parts of Ukraine. So we as an international society, we cannot allow. There is no other outcome to this war than ending it by Russian forces withdrawing from Ukraine, from the whole of it, and ending it. I don't understand the Western media, you know, when they are saying, they need to start talking. Man, if someone came to your saloon, to your home, would you negotiate with them? Okay, you can take a part of the bedroom and maybe this bathroom because I don't like it anyway. It's non-negotiable. We need to go back to where Ukraine was in 2014 when they were invaded for the first time. I'm just a simple country boy from Australia, so the politics is completely beyond me. Like, I am completely maxed out on all of that. Completely beyond me. Like I am completely maxed out on all of that. What I know from what I've seen is this incredible humility and compassion and just niceness, like severe, like humanity being. Lashes and lashes of humanity here, which I just didn't expect. Which I've got to say, I mean, I don't even know. I suppose I have to congratulate every Polish person because it was done as a group, but all by yourselves. Yeah. By individual decisions. Hive mind. Yeah, yeah, like a hive mind. Yeah, and I'm very happy to be part of this. And I must say it was very encouraging to hear all the support from friends from Western Europe. I had friends who were like sending me money to help me with the Ukrainian refugees. I was very, very appreciated. And a lot of people did care about what's happening. Also, the Ukrainians were super happy when they heard like, you know, there's someone in London. They just sent me a hundred pounds to buy you food and clothes. And they're like, you really, like your friends did send you money to help us? Like this is, it was a ridiculous concept for them. And you know, when they were going to Poland, it's also interesting. They had no idea what's going to happen. They were packing, they could only take limited amount of baggage and they had no idea what's going to happen. They were packing. They could only take a limited amount of baggage, and they had no idea if they will receive any help in here. So they usually took even food with them, items that were unnecessary because they would receive everything in here, but they had no idea it will happen. They were also venturing into a very unknown world. They had no idea what kind of help they will receive they had no if anything they had no idea if if they will be any friendliness or will they end up in some refugee camp but as soon as as the first batch did land here and they found okay guys it's it's safe it's good it's helpful the the second wave was insanely big. Like third, maybe fourth week of the war, the amount of people coming here was unimaginable. In Warsaw alone, I think we had like 400,000 refugees. Warsaw being a two million people city, one in every five people was a Ukrainian refugee. Insane mass of people. And you say you don't see them on the streets today. You didn't see them back then. They were handled then. At some point, we worried that we will run out of capacity to help them. And also, the first batch was people who were maybe more suited, wealthier, ones who maybe worked outside of Ukraine, you know. For them, it was not as difficult choice as for those who were coming later. All sorts of people escaped war, poor and rich. It does not discriminate. Like, everyone is in a shitty situation so different types of people were coming but eventually like we had people who were the first batch were more brave maybe they spoke some polish maybe they spoke some english it was much easier for them to to get started the second batch there was like people who were not speaking any Polish, English, but they were managed. And then even though it was a huge volume, we were worried that if there is a third wave of the same size, we would be completely overwhelmed as a country. But it didn't happen. At that point, the Ukrainians started to receive real military help from the West and started having victories on the battlefield. So this also slowed down this progress. So I've got a really big feeling you don't need me to have come in here to help you at all. I think you've got everything all sorted. So we're just going to talk fire science. Like, this is a great presentation today. Thank you. Yeah, on fire. So just to make this a fire, like, okay, so I've taken over the show and I'm interviewing you, but really great presentation on resilience and fire engineering and everything. I really enjoyed that. Sorry about the damage I've done, sort of kicking my way in here to save you and everything. You're not a small person, Arnold, and I can forgive you that. Oh, thank you. If you'll let me play your crane when I'm visiting you in Australia. Of course you can come play with my crane. Absolutely. Well, I suppose that's my business done. I'm almost speechless with what I've found, and it gives me tremendous faith in human nature and kindness and goodness. Different language, different alphabet, different religion. Didn't even think of the different food and I don't even see it. I'm walking in this city and I don't even see it or feel it. It's amazing. And I tell you there's still like a few hundred thousand of these refugees living in Warsaw still. Yeah. At this day. I hear them. You hear a different language. That's what you said, is a city of languages. Well, Arlo, thank you. I didn't have a chance to talk about this, and I feel there is a lot of people interested in this story. For me, it's mainly the story of Ukrainian nation bravery. That's the main story. We did the easy part. We took care of their children and their wives and those in need. So these guys can really focus on winning the important battle. And I really hope they are victorious. I really hope because that's, if they're going to lose, I'm going to lose faith in humanity. I obviously hope it doesn't escalate into larger war. World war would be a bummer. It would be a real bummer. We had two of those. Yeah. And they were both horrible. They were good. They never end well. If I can tell you one more thing, one more story from the beginning of the war. By sheer coincidence, when the war was beginning, I was reading a biography of a Polish scientist, Stanislaw Ulam. Ulam was a very famous Polish mathematician from the Lw√≥w School of Thought. He eventually ended up in Los Alamos working on a nuclear, on the atomic bomb. He worked with Professor Feynman. He was a very famous scientist in the US, very cherished, and one of the best Polish mathematicians that lived. And I read his biography, and he was 20 some years old when the Second World War started, and he was traveling across Europe meeting with other scientists back then. And in his biography, he was reporting what people were saying, like, ah, Hitler is not going to attack Poland, that's ridiculous, or stuff that, okay, as soon as he attacks, we're going to bit his ass, nothing's going to happen. soon as he attacks, we're going to beat his ass. Nothing's going to happen. And, you know, many of things he was describing then relating to the Second World War and how it's begun and how the refugee wave from Poland escaped Poland. I felt like I'm reading something from 2022. It was like I felt that the same, you know, way of thinking of the world about the conflict, the same headlines in the news, the same stuff, it was like the same exact thing happening as in his biography that was related to the World War II, which is very discouraging because it seems we don't learn as a species that much. But on the other hand, the compassion and humanity that I've observed here and felt myself is incredibly encouraging. And the world through my eyes at the moment, this is a really optimistic place. It's a place where I'm seeing firsthand what you called it hive thinking, where normal people make good choices to help each other. You know what? I also need to reflect on one thing when we're talking about the war, the humor, the jokes. You know, there was this moment where there was a video on the Internet when gypsies stole a tank from the Russian army. It was an incredible joke between Polish and us and the Ukrainians. We all have some stereotypes about gypsies stealing everything. Ukrainian gypsies know there are stereotypes about them. And they literally stole a Russian tank and they posted a video like, ah, the gypsies stole the tank? I don't know. And the guy is literally like taking a video of him with a big ass tank standing. Maybe with it, maybe with it not. I have no idea. And then he's driving the tank and was like, oh, my God, the gypsies stole the Russian tank. Like, this is hilarious. And it was hilarious. And all the memes that were happening about the war. I think there was this NAFO. It's like a joke about NATO. It's like a meme force over Internet, which ended up being a very huge humanitarian aid, gathering money for the Ukraine through humor. And I think it's not that it was necessary, but it was helpful. Like, there's no point in despairing about the war and sitting and crying, oh, the war is happening. It was interesting to have something that made you smile while living through that. I think it was very helpful to Polish, to Ukrainian people as well. We were also watching news together. Actually, that was horrible to watch news together, because we were watching news to know what's happening, and they were watching news to understand if some of their relatives or friends died. That was horrible. And there were many, many stories of people who came here, women, and they received news that their husband has just died. Horrible stories. And I think that that may be, that may have been the hardest part to help them, you know. Like, there's nothing you can do, obviously, about that. But, you know, to have such emotional damage and unbelievable pain, especially when someone's child has died or something. Insane story. That's why our grandparents, when they were blessing us, they were saying, I bless you, never experience war. Like, this is what they knew about the war. That's the war they saw. And now I understand what they meant about it, that we don't experience war. War is horrible. And I hope Ukrainian people stop experiencing that soon. Well, thank you very much for joining your show. Thank you very much for taking over my show. Oh, look, I'll try and get that door back on the hinges and everything, and well, I suppose it's goodbye from the Five Sides show. Thanks, Arnold. It was a pleasure to participate in your show. And thank you for taking initiative to do this interview. I did not enjoy it, but I hope some people would enjoy the fact that we've discussed this. And I hope that the bravery of Ukrainians and kindness of Polish people will not be forgotten. And for our nations, that definitely is a new beginning for many, many generations of coexistence, friendship. And man, as soon as this ends we make a huge ass fire conference at Ukraine and Crimea and it's going to be the biggest party you've seen in your life. Sounds like a plan. Trust on this. Yeah, yeah. Okay. That sounds like a plan. Okay. Thank you, Arlo. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Thanks.
