Introduction by Enrico Ronchi

That is joined today. And yes, here we are, and we are with the third webinar of our young viewer in fires webinar series, and this is Enrico Ronchi speaking. 
I am one of the co leaders of the group within the international association for fire safety science, together with Erica Kuligowski that you've seen before, and I'm very glad today to introduce dr ann templeton and dr miladagani that are the two very brilliant researchers, and also to dear friends that work in our field, and today we're going to hear about the misuse of controversial terminologies in vacation research. 
So a very interesting topic, because, let's say, there is a lot of discussions in the scientific community of human being fire on what is the correct terms that we should use when referring to different aspects linked to a vacation. Just to give a practical example, I'm part. of the iso group on vocabulary of technical committee 92 on fire safety, and I hear a lot of discussions there on different terms. 
So this is probably going to be very useful also for me to feed that conversation and just a couple of information here. This is the third event of our webinar series. We have a youtube channel where we post all our webinars and you also have the opportunity to join the five parent group of ifss. This can be to contribute or remain updated. You don't pay anything. It is free. 
We're gonna post now this link in the chat. You just put your info and you enter the mailing list and you will be kept updated on the next events and next activities of our group. So, as mentioned today, we are gonna have first dr ann templeton, that is a ukri future leaders. 
Fellow in the department of psychology at the university of edinburgh in scotland, and she's a specialist in understanding intra and intergroup processes in collective behavior, with a particular focus on applying social identity approach to pedestrian simulation. So she's really into social identity theory. So this is a very good perspective for this webinar. Thanks and to be here and then we will have also. 
Miladagani is a senior lecturer and an australian research council dcr cra fellow at the school of civil and environmental engineering of the university of new south wales in sydney, and he specializes in various domain of human factors in public safety, research, particularly pedestrian and vacation dynamics. So also really great to have you here, milad, thanks to both. 
So I don't want to take too much of your time, because we want to have you both presenting and then at the end. we also want to have some q a sessions. So if there are questions from the audience, we will pick it up there at the end. So I now stop my slides and I ask you and if you can show your slideshow absolutely all right. The floor is yours, thank you. 
Can I just check the slide is changing? Yes, everything works okay, okay, excellent, and thank you so much for having me present the stop, and thank you so much everyone for attending and coming along. 


Dr Anne Templeton

And enrico just gave you a bit of a brief blurb about me, but just to give you a bit more background context. 
So my background is in crowded psychology, and then I moved into pedestrian modeling for my phd and then later into evacuation research and coming from that crowd psychology perspective, I was really surprised to see terms like panic. and contagion in the evacuation literature and the broader pedestrian modeling literature, because we don't really use them as explanations for collective behavior in modern career psychology. 
In fact, a lot of our work is trying to refute the notions behind these terms. So in this talk I really want to look at. I want to look at the evidence for panic and contagion in emergencies, and I just want to dissect what we actually mean by those terms and make some recommendations for ways to explain evacuation behavior and evacuations. So why do we want to discuss panic and contagion? Why is this important? 
Oh whoops, there we go. We use terms like stampede and mass panic in contagion and we often use these to explain collective behavior in emergencies and the underlying idea of these terms and these sort of sensationalist headlines you see in the media like. you've got some in the slide here is that people in a crowd will become panicked automatically and they'll act irrationally and dangerously. That's the kind of sensationalist connotation. 
But we use these terms in literature quite a lot, and I really want to dissect what these terms mean and how inaccurate or accurate they are when understanding collective response to emergencies. So the first recommendation I really want to be. I don't know why this is jumping ahead there we are. The first recommendation I really want to make is to not overuse the term panic now say this for a few reasons. 
I want to really think about how common this idea of panic actually is, or isn't? This is one of my favorite papers I've read recently. There's a systematic review that was conducted by dharma bar and colleagues, and it was a review of 630 media. 
Articles about 127 collective flight responses to misperceived threats, and I find the systematic really interesting, because the authors actively search for terms such as stampede, fleet or panic, and then they look to the description of the behavior in the media and also what can be seen in video footage of those events. 
And when they were looking in detail at the behavior of the events, they found that stampedes were actually very rare and there were rarely reasons for injuries, like we tend to assume in the literature when we look at the occurrence of competitive behavior like pushing or trampling. This was also relatively rare. It's actually less than half of the incidents that were reviewed, and I think we often have this kind of assumption. 
There's this homogeneous or panic or herding response in evacuations, but actually what this review found was there are diverse responses. to threats or misperceived threats. For example, we found that some people in the emergencies would run away. They would flee, but many just walked away calmly and others would stop or film or try and investigate the reason for the situation or even try to intervene with the apparent source of the threat. 
I think something really crucial that comes across from this paper is that reports of behavior such as the running, the screaming, the crying occurred more in text accounts of the events than could actually be seen in the videos of those incidences. 
So there's an imbalance of what is reported and what can actually be seen, what's reported in the text about events and then what can actually be seen in the behavior of those events, and I think this is why it's useful to really critique the idea what we mean by panic so. 
Emergencies are can be scary things and it can be really unclear what to do, especially if you've not had guidance beforehand, evacuation guidance, and if we look at footage of emergencies, we might see lots of people running in the same direction. What we might call a stampede, and often terms like panic is used to mean this irrational behavior, the source of reasons acting on instinct. 
We use terms like fight or flight, which is this kind of automatic biological response to flee. But the problem is that what behavior people enact in an emergency? What they're actually doing at the time might make complete sense to them. 
But we're looking at it from an outsider perspective and we look at footage to try and infer why people are acting in a certain way with their own biases and expectations, and it wasn't really until the last few. decades we started sort of systematically asking people experiencing the emergency why they behaved in that way. 
I think it's important to look at the perspective of people in the emergency, because knowing the reasons for this behavior is important to have an accurate idea of why the behavior is actually happening. So I've only got about 20 minutes, so I'm gonna give you a very brief history of crown psychology, and this is a huge topic, so very happy to talk about it in more detail if anyone's interested. 
So I want to go back in time to 1985, and one of the first kind of popular books of course psychology was by gustav lebon, and it was the crowd of the study of the popular mind. So lebon was writing about french crowds and he was kind of writing for the late and he was talking a lot. 
About sort of people who were in the revolution, and he portrayed the crowd as being very criminal, as this filmless mass, and his argument was that when people enter a crowd just by the product of being in a crowd situation, they would lose their sense of self, they would become submerged into the crowd, they could be easily hypnotized and performing certain actions by a leader, and you argued that in emergencies, crowd members would irrationally panic and typically do the wrong thing, and he also argued that there's this automatic transference of emotion in a crowd, this idea of contagion. 
So if one person gets angry or panics, everybody would just by being near them. And although these aren't the exact meanings of the words that we use now, we do still see words like contagions and contagion, irrational panic, used now with some of the same. connotations if we fast forward about 100 years. 
If we look at modern crowd psychology, the evidence suggests that lebon's accounts of panic and contagion don't hold up, and we look at accounts given by people who've experienced the evacuations or other emergencies. Some do report panic it's not. They say panic doesn't occur. 
But we really need to critique what this ideal panic actually means, and a great example of this one of my favorite pieces of work is by chris caulking and john drury with survivors of the hillsborough stadium disaster. 
So this was a large disaster at football match in england in 1989, and disaster started when an entry gate was opened because they thought it would be easing crowdfull but or easing overcrowding, but actually led to too many fans entering into the fan pens and eventually there was a crush. Fans were trying to. 
Climb the fences to get onto the pitch to escape and we've been held back by security and police, and it was a huge tragedy in modern british history because 97 people died and there were 766 injuries. Chris cokey and john jury looked at the language that was used by survivors to describe what was happening during the event, and what they found is that language used by a survivor suggests panic means very different things. 
So, for example, people would refer to themselves as an individual panicking but said that it wasn't widespread in the crowd. It was them as an individual. Wasn't everyone panicking, or they would describe feeling fear but not panic. They refuted the idea of acting irrational, even though they were fearful, and when someone did talk about feeling blind panic, it was under very extreme circumstances. They were walking on dead bodies. Apologies. 
I know it's very early in the morning to be talking about that, but it was understandable that they were feeling that way, or they used the term panic when they were struggling to really articulate what they, what they meant, how they felt, and it was always talking about the emotions, not the behavior, or people sometimes reported panicking because they actually wanted to help others. 
Far from this idea of individualistic panic and, crucially, the panic that many described when they were talking about behavior were normative or understandable behaviors. Or they talked about panicked individuals, but again not for the whole crowd, or they were describing distress, understandable distress, and some actually discussed their being calm behavior, despite this horrific situation, and I want to look at a few more examples of what survivors and emergencies have said about behavior that occurred in those emergencies to see. what panic existed or didn't exist because we see a similar story. So I mentioned a few key texts here. 
There's some of my favorite kind of seminal text for this area, and these papers explored why behavior happened from the respective of those who experienced the emergency and they found similar findings for their search across emergencies on cruise ships, football stadium crushes, stadium fires, hotel fires, bomb skiers, building evacuations, train evacuations, lots of different type of emergencies, and what they found is that, contrary to panicking, people actually often maintained ordinary behavior such as cueing, letting others go first to evacuate, saying you know you go first, and they reported a sense of calm despite the situation, and when behaviors occurred that we might see from the outside as potentially irrational, such as people returning to dangerous situations to help others, they explained that they were helping. 
Others in the basis of feeling part of the same group as them. So what was happening is in the emergency. This perceived shared fate, this common fate, this facing the same threat, brought them together to feel part of the same group and they helped others in the basis of that group membership. 
Now I'm going to talk more about those group dynamics in a minute, but just for now I want to focus on panic in these quotes. So here's an example from one of the papers and this first quote. The interviewer asks: did you think anybody panicked and the person responded in our carriage, in our train carriage? No, or if they did, they panicked inwardly. They didn't express their panic. 
I mean there was no screaming in our carriage. I mean people were trying to get out the door, but they weren't trying to get. out the door stupidly. So really refuting this idea of a rational panic, people running around screaming they weren't. And I'm not going to read the second quote for the sake of time, but what you can see in this quote is the sense of calm and speaking against the idea of rational panicking. 
So those can, despite the hectic situation and really refuting the idea that people were they said they weren't, you know, running around screaming their heads off. Now, if anyone has seen a talk by crowd psychologists, they might have heard of social identity theory and subcategorization theory. 
These are theories that we often use to explain group dynamics, and I just want to give you a very brief description of them to help kind of underlay a lot of these group dynamics I'm going to be talking about. The first is social identity theory, social. identity theory suggests that we have a personal identity. 
That's our individual differences, idiosyncratic things to us, and we have social identities and these are our memberships of social groups and we can be members of multiple social groups. 
It could be a fan of particular sports team, it could be being an academic, being a twitch streamer, can be a firefighter, and knowing having these social groups is really important for understanding how we navigate the social world, because these groups often have kind of norms and behaviors associated with them. They guide us how to act. We look to others in a group to know how we should be acting. 
And just to give you a little some key terminology for going forward one key term we use in car psychology psychology's in group member. This is someone who we perceive as being in the same group as. 
The same social category, and this is particularly relevant for emergencies, because research from social psychology quite broadly has suggested that if we see someone as an ingrid member, we're more likely to help them to show helping behavior towards them and trust them trust information from them. Giving you an example. They're levine tools and excellent paper. 
So self categorization theory aims to explain how we categorize others in ourselves into these social groups in different contexts, how we shift from considering ourselves as being an individual, that personal identity, to considering ourselves as a group member, that social identity, and this is really important for understanding emergencies, because evidence suggests that perceiving this common fate, this common threat, can bring people together where they start to see others as good members, and understanding how people come together in emergency and the effects of that group membership is important. 
For two key reasons. The first is understanding helping in cooperative behavior, like those I mentioned a minute ago, letting others go first running back to help others. The second, which I'm going to talk about more now, is understanding social influence, such as how particular behaviors or actions might spread through a crowd in an emergency, and also the bounds of that influence, how far that behavior might spread or not spread. 
So my second recommendation is that we should stop using the word contagion and instead use social influence, because it is a more nuanced, appropriate description of behavior. So contagion is this idea that emotions or ideas are contagious and sweep through the crowd with a sort of automatic transference. To some degree, social influence is different. So I am to argue that contagion is not the best explanation for how emotions or behavior become common in. a crowd. 
A better explanation is social influence. Research from social psychology suggests that we're more likely to look to people in our group for information about how to act. We're more likely to trust them and perceive that what they're doing is normative for our group. It's awkward members do, and this can be particularly the case in emergencies, because often they're novel. 
It's not really clear how to react or how to respond to this new situation, so we look to others for guidance. I'm conducting research for the uk department of levelling up housing and communities and aiming to look at how group dynamics impact evacuations in high rise buildings, particularly in fire situations. The overall project is led by michael spear points. 
It's in collaboration with steve quinn, and this work is a bit a work in progress still finalizing the analysis, but I just wanted. to show you some of the initial findings, because I think they're very relevant to explaining social influence. So we conducted individual interviews with 23 members of the fire and rescue services in england in scotland, to explore their understanding of key factors impacting safe evacuations and high rise residential buildings. 
We also conducted focus group with focus group interviews with 40 occupants of high rise buildings. Really, they were trying to just dig into the role of group processes and how they would respond or have responded previously to emergency evacuations. So what was really interesting is that social influence came up again and again when understanding behavior and evacuations. 
So both the fire and rescue services and the occupants of the high rise buildings said that, rather than panicking and rushing out the door, residents tended to delay evacuation or would delay evacuation in order to seek out. 
Information from others about and share information with others about how to respond, and residents said that they would even go further into the building you know closer to the fire to seek out others because they wanted to see how they were reacting and get their perspective on what to do, seek validation, how to behave. 
This information sharing included establishing whether the threat was actually present, how severe it was, what others were doing were saying and what the best way to respond was. But crucially, one of the most interesting things that we found was there is a hierarchy in whose information was trusted, sort of a hierarchy. This was impacted by group processes. 
So there are lots of examples of information sharing, for example resident whatsapp groups or facebook groups, and but the extent to which occupants would follow the evacuation instructions that were given or. the guidance others were given very much depended on whether the people or person giving that information was seen to be a member of the same group. 
So, for example, residents said that they would be more likely to listen to the fire and rescue services if they thought that the fire and rescue services were helping them and acting on behalf of residents and if they previously had good interactions with fire and risky services, such as through community engagement initiatives. 
They made them feel closer to them in comparison to this, and some residents actually said that they would be less likely to listen to instructions from, say, the police or even open the front door in case it was the police, because they felt that the police were outgrouped. They were different. They weren't acting on behalf of the residents, they weren't in the same group, the. same situation. 
Another example, if we just look at the kind of intra group relations within residents, is that they said they would seek out their friends in the building first when establishing how to act and that they trusted their friends. More than a resident wants that group for people who they didn't feel as close to. 
So, in a nutshell, what we're finding in this analysis is that the evidence we found about responses to fires and high rise buildings in the uk seem to not support any theories about panic or contagion. Instead, residents delay evacuation to seek out information about the fire and decide how to act and when deciding how to act. 
This is important, but they trusted and followed information more from people they saw as being in group members or acting on behalf of the group. So there are limitations to the social. influence and limitation to who is attended to and who is involved. Just briefly, this is the last bit of work I'm going to tell you about. So we're done. I've talked quite a lot about qualitative work. 
When I show you some experiment, experimental evidence we have for this. This is also some work in progress at the moment. So it's part of a project called perceived threats and stampedes, our relational model, collective fear responses, and really in this we want to understand the role of group processes in response to threats in an evacuation scenario. 
It's led by professor john jury at the university of sussex and it's funded by the asrc, and enrico is also part of this project. The core question here is: who do we pay attention to in the media aftermath of an emergency and how does this impact our evacuation behavior so? we actually have a series of studies that build on each other. 
But just for the second time, I'm going to give you an example, studying some example findings. So here's our design. We recruited people who considered themselves to be very concerned about environmental issues and we told them it was for an urban navigation study. It wasn't that's deception? Never trust a psychologist. They were actually given an evacuation scenario. So they're presented with this virtual environment where an ambiguous sound goes off. 
They could potentially be seen as threatening. They're then told by members of the crowd. Members of the crowd it was either that sound was either a gun shot, so something threatening a door slamming something non threatening or a control condition was unknown. They didn't know what it was and, crucially, the information about what the noise was given by either an in group. member, someone who is also an environmentalist or a stranger. 
This is the control condition, and so we manipulated whether the noise was threatening or not and whether who the information was coming from in group member or someone else, and we measured the effects of this on identification with others in the crowd. The essential developed part of the same group with others, the intended response for the evacuation trust and information about the noise and perceived danger. 
So the preliminary findings suggest that when the noise was perceived to be threatening, this is the gunshot condition. It increased the perception that others in the crowd were part of the same group it brought them together. This is very similar from what I've mentioned earlier. We've seen other sort of emergencies where that perceived common threat that perceived threat brings people together to feel part of the same group. in the influence of others. 
How much they would follow others was related to the extent to which they saw those others as being in group members. So they would be more likely to follow the behavior of others, the more they saw them as in group as being part of that same group. So what does all of this mean? Just to bring it all together? Please, please let's not rely on the word panic. 
I think we can do better with describing that behavior. Panic is a really easy catch all word, especially when looking at flight behavior. But we should be specific and consider what's actually happening from perspective for people in the crowds and think about what we mean when we're saying panic. Do we actually mean that people are alarmed, that they are uncertain or scared, and keep in mind that the evidence suggests people? 
Will still act rationally and look for appropriate courses of action, even when they are alarmed or scared, and the evidence suggests that people do not usually act irrationally in emergencies, but they're reacting to novel, uncertain situations and potentially scary events. 
Actually, the evidence suggests people often under react or will, depending on the emergency, they might actually delay leaving while they look to others for information and the role of group dynamics and understanding collective responses comes up again and again across all different types of emergencies. I think going forward we really need to explore these in more detail and evaluate how and why crowd members interact and respond to threatening situations. For example. 
We can see from research and group dynamics. There's very little evidence for contagion, this idea that emotions spur wildly and hurting behavior occurs. Instead, we see how people make delay evacuation while. they seek information from others. This operates within those boundaries of who is trusted. If people are more likely to trust those who sees being a member of the group or acting on behalf of the group, the evidence suggests. 
In a nutshell, social influence is better way for understanding how collective paper emerges and the balance of how much that behavior spreads. So thank you very much for listening, and this is really a whistlestop tour. If you have any questions, we wouldn't talk about it. I'd love to. Here's my email address. In the meantime, I will stop sharing. Thank you. 
Thanks, ann, for the very interesting and let's say spot on presentation on terminology and now it's time for milad, so we will take all questions at the end. So milad, please share your screen and the floor is yours. 


Dr Milad Haghani

Thank you very much. Thank you very. much and for the beautiful presentation. She absolutely covered a lot of very useful grounds in this space. It's very useful for myself as well. 
It is a pleasure to be with you all. I am a little bit conscious of time, so I'm going to quickly get into the main content with not too much introduction. So let's get into the main part. Okay, I have to put some disclaimers first. So the topic is about the use of term controversial terminologies and, as you will see in my thought, that talk itself is a little bit controversial as well. 
My request is that you don't take any of the content that I'm presenting against me in the future. The topic is complicated and in order for me to be able to get to the bottom of it and I take the problem, I have to have a candid. 
Conversation with you, and that requires me getting into a little bit of needy, greedy level of details, and if anybody's work it gets mentioned and if anybody's name as an author or academic gets mentioned, please don't hold it against me. 
It's just purely for the purpose of making and making an academic discussion, and please don't assume that neither and or I are policing the literature or acting as vigilantes, and if you get challenged on your papers, for example, on the use of these terminologies, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is us. That sentiment is shared with you know across a lot of people, and we are just presenting that sentiment and to you today. 
We just happen to be the ones presenting it. So please don't think that hagan is a literature police and if you get challenged for the use of these terminologies, it's. necessarily me okay, let's move on to the main topic. 
The main sources of the presentation talk is these two papers: the first paper that we wrote in 2019 with emiliano christiani, nicole I bought, mike boats and alessandro corbetta, titled panic, irrationality and herding, and a paper and a more recent paper that I published in 2021 in physical, the knowledge domain of crowd dynamics. So predominantly the content is coming from these studies. So what I am covering? I'm mainly covering these issues. 
What are the controversial terms and why do we care about them? How old is this discussion? How prevalent is the problem? What's the origin of the problem? Who are the people who are using these languages? I'm using a little bit of a spicy language here. I hope you don't take it literally. Yeah, and I am also going to have a brief. 
Look at the language of non academic media in relation to the use of these terms. Also at the end, I'm going to summarize what the implications of the use of panic and irrationalities and what my recommendations is and what my recommendations are and what also what are the implications of the term hurting and what are the recommendations in that regard? So this is the scope of the target for today. 
I was trying to come up with an introduction. I could not come up with one better than the one that we wrote on the on the paper panic irrationality, and so, if you don't mind, I'm just going to read it out to you. Here we go. As researchers working in the field of pedestrian dynamics, we have experienced that the presentation of a piece of research on the topic of crowd evacuation whether to an. 
Academic audience or lay audience, barely goes without, barely goes by without researchers being confronted with these questions. How about the effect of panic? How do you model experiment panic? And to a lesser extent, we get these questions from in our review processes, although not recently, unless we go to non specialty journals. 
Another point: we have also observed that these debates are often not resolved in the rigorous argument based on facts and empirical evidence, and are rather addressed in some level of speculation and resorting to intuition. Nevertheless, nevertheless, researchers often concede that these might be limitations of their study. Moving on, the question that arises is why, after so many years of research in the field of crowd dynamics, these terms have remained so interactable. 
And my last point, the issue of panic. I have observed this in the literature. The issue of panic constitutes a. rather frequent disclaimer at the discussion section of publications and corrupt evacuation papers and a common ground for criticizing the modeling and experimentation in this field. Such disclaimers offer appear in wordings such as these experiments were conducted under non panic conditions or the influence of panic has been excluded from the experiment. 
So the fact that researchers have felt the obligation to put these disclaimers so this gives the indication that simulating or modeling panic is going to be a future development or a golden standard or an ultimate goal in this field, something that the research is headed towards, but one that we have not been able to tackle just yet. Okay, so what are the implications of all of these? 
Okay, we get to the bottom of it in this talk: the controversial terms. What are they and why do we care about their use the terms? are panic irrationality, hurting understandably predominantly. The reason we care about them is not just because they are inaccurate terminologies. It's because of the fact that they have significantly altered the course of crowd dynamics research and we think that they have misdirected a lot of research efforts in this space. 
That's why we are talking about the technologies. That's not simply because the terminologies are not necessarily accurate. They have major implications on research and in crowd management practices. How will this discussion? Is this discussion? Well, you might not believe it, but the discussion dates back to many years ago, much older than I thought so in the paper, the knowledge domain of crowd dynamics. 
I have presented an over a historical overview of the pedestrian dynamics and I came across this seminar in human behavior. I can't see the title in emergencies and in that in. 
That webinar, which was held in 1978, essentially there was a meeting dedicated to the notion of panic, where, in the meeting prior to the meeting, all panelists were asked to address themselves in some way to three questions: do you see the concept of panic as a useful one for the study purposes? This is exactly what we are the point that we have been trying to investigate in the paper panicky right personality herding back then. 
I was not aware of this meeting and this conference paper that emerged 10 years before I was born, and it is very interesting to note that those discussions are not really original put forward by us, but rather they have been talking about this issue in back in 1970s. How do you conceptualize? What are the factors responsible for the phenomena and what are both research consequences and practical implications? 
Of thinking about panic in the way that you do, and if you look at the sentiment of these papers, they actually share the same sentiment that we are presenting to today to you, and it is very interesting that since then, the literature has taken a turn and has gone against it. So what has been the fact the motivating factor for that? 
We get into that as well in terms of the implications of the use of these terms in policy. Their implications are crystal clear. It has been used as an excuse for politicians, crowd managers, emergency services, to withhold information from people. 
You might remember that back when trump was in was in office, he mentioned in an interview with bob woodward that the reason that he withheld information about coronavirus from people and its severity was that he didn't want people to panic. 
And that's that way of thinking is actually sure that among many people it's that this way of thinking is kind of entrenched in the in the mind of public, and when they become politicians also, they take that to emergency management practices. So that's the implications of the use of these terms in actual emergency management practice by politicians, by emergency services. 
But our focus today is within academic literature, not necessarily practice so in the paper, panic irrationality. And thirdly, what we looked at was first of all we investigated whether the use of the controversial terms are increasing in the literature or they are gradually disappearing from the literature, and what we observed was that for all three terms, panic irrationality and the use of the terms are actually increasing. 
They are not going anywhere, but not everybody's saying uses this language in the same way. some people use them as they mean it. Some people, you like myself in many of the papers. We use them as we criticize it. So there's a mixture of the mention of these terms. The blue ones are the ones where the person is in support of the theory. 
The red ones are the frequency of the ones where the person uses them in a critical way. But nevertheless, the use of the terms in the in the literature of dynamics seems to be increasing, and I have more recently looked at the entire papers of karat dynamics nearly 7 000 papers and I identified those that have used at least one of these controversial terminologies in their title and abstracts. 
The subset is about 70.670 or something, and as you see, the frequency of the use of the terms has been increasing over the years panic being. the most dominant one, but in to a lesser extent the other three terms as well. 
There is there seems to be a sign of decline in the use of these terms, especially since 2019. I don't want to flatter myself too much and say that it's because of the paper panic, irrationality and building. It might be a contributing factors, but another contributing factors factor could be the fact that the number of crowd players have slightly declined during pandemic. I have covered that in another in another paper. 
Some of you might be reviewing that paper at the moment it's a paper on the review at this stage, but overall it seems that since 2019 the frequency has slowed down to a certain extent. We cannot be too sure what the reason is, but I would like to hope that the 6 000 downloads that the paper. panic, irrationality and herding has had has had some effect on the use of these terms. 
Hopefully, and to the very to this very day, the very recent papers that are emerging interact dynamics, even in the context of pandemic, you can see that the controversial language is being used. For example, this quote from this paper, that I'm not specifying, says numerical simulations with this model revealed that these measures do not prevent the transmission of disease in high density areas, especially when agents move underpants. 
So the language still sticks to the literature and it's very persistent, despite our efforts in criticizing it. I've also looked at the frequency of the use of the terms in relation to other terms in the abstract of those 700 papers that have mentioned these terms and it appears that panic and its variations it's got a lot of variation and i. 
Have combined them all to the term panic and its variations has a central role, meaning that it gets co mentioned with almost every term in front dynamics, whereas in the literature the use of a stampede is more specific and it gets mentioned with a more specific set of commission with a more specific set of terms. And the herd behavior also gets mentioned with an even more specific set of terms. 
So kanek is the central one in the academic literature in terms of the frequency and in terms of diversity of topics that it has penetrated. But what's the origin of the problem? Well, the origin of the problem and the frequency of the use of these terms. I can pinpoint to the paper of kelvin in 2000 in nature, which is probably one of the most the most influential paper of crowd dynamics, where he presented. 
The social force model in the context of fanny, he used the term panic 37 times and he used the term herding ten times in the paper. Well, it's a very influential paper. Once you have a paper in nature. People would follow that pathway of thinking that this is the way forward in the future, and I think this is where our love for using this language started in the literature. 
Helping himself in the paper attributes herding as one of the characteristics of panic behavior. Here, he says, one of the characteristics of panic behavior is that people show a tendency towards mass behavior that is, to do what other people do, which we know as perpetrator. And this is also where our love for discovering counterintuitive phenomena in throughout dynamics started to emerge, for example the fact that we have to take a space away from people. 
In order for their movement to become more efficient. If you put an obstacle in front of them or if you limit space for them, their movement becomes more efficient. 
This is based on the mentality that people show irrational behavior during evacuations during life threatening situations, and if you give them more options, they do things that are to their detriment where, as none of this has been supported by any empirical evidence, but that has set a precedent in the literature that we really like to see counterintuitive drug control measures. 
Put an obstacle, put a block in front of people, take space away from them, ask them not to rush at the exits when there is a life threatening situation, ask them to slow down, because if they rush, it's going to slow down, slow down the process. Well, I can speak about the you know all. aspects of helping's paper for like an hour. 
I was going to present it in the pet conference into 2020, before it got canceled due to chronovirus and then after, because it was the 20th anniversary of the paper. Then after it got answered, I decided not to do it and also didn't participate in pet. So hopefully in next vid there will be an opportunity. If you know alessandro and mohsen, give me and give you an opportunity for an extended fight. 
I will cover all aspects of the paper, but as far as the language goes, I think this has been the reason for the use of controversial terms in current dynamics and on top of that, oh, by the way, this phenomena in the first paragraph of the paper helping mentions one of the most disastrous forms of collective behavior is the kind of crowd stampede induced. 
By panic and he goes on and cites two references, and you look at reference number one. It's actually the paper from cheating which is titled the myth of panic. Well, I cannot help but notice the irony of the situation that this paper, as the title shows, cannot be any support of this statement. The paper is called the myth of panic in the first place. 
So that is a little bit, you know, contradictory to me and I'm confusing the way these references have been put forward. Also, the news and views piece that was releasing the same issue of nature on top of this paper, to you know elaborate a bit on the contribution of the paper, didn't leave any room for speculation that the point panic, the issue of panic, was the selling point of the paper, after all, helping had already presented in a. paper in 1995 in physical review with the principles of social force. 
So now that and along the fact that this news and we use focus on the issue of penny, did not leave any room for doubt that the matter panic was in fact the selling point and was considered the contribution of the paper by the editors and the viewers of nature right. And this has this news envious piece has also had many implications for research in this area. I will go through a few of them. 
For example, this paragraph reads: to decide whether a particular model is an accurate description of real life or to determine which model is the best for the situation under consideration requires real data to compare to compare with each mother's predictions. Beautiful, that's what we say too. But what is what comes next is but such data are scarce. and or non existent and maybe extremely difficult to collect. 
This became a talking point for many papers that came after this, so they decided: okay, we are facing a situation panic. It's not solvable. It's so intractable, there's not no doubt. So we have only two feasible solutions. One is that either we resort to or to our own intuitions for our modeling purposes, to our for our modeling practices. 
Or we do animal experiments, we do experiments with ants, we do experiments with groups of mice instead of doing experiments with humans, simply because of the fact that penny cannot be experimented with humans. So that gave a justification for many of the subsequent papers to go down paths that we do not really see beneficial. Dynamics, modeling without any connection to empirical data, or doing experiments that have no connection to human participants. That's that and also. 
Another element is this picture that entrenched the idea in the mind of the next generations of crowd researchers and phd students, etc. That if you develop a model that does not create this situation, that's not an accurate model. Why, because a graph is in nature came up with this with this image. Well, this is this does not have any connection to any to any empirical evidence. It's just a nice little, nice looking graphics. 
But it had many implications for research in this area and I'm pretty sure that you have seen this image or something equivalent of it in many other papers. So cannot emphasize on the role of these two papers on the in the future, on the development of crowd dynamics since 2000. And also last one is that there is this line saying that the consequences of crushing trampling and panicking panic in. 
Crowds are well known and similar to the origin to the actual paper by building, the author cites two references, and one of them is this paper by johnson, and this paper by johnson is the is the paper that reads in the abstract I report evidence showing that panic did not cause the death and injury of numerous young people prior to concert blah. 
So I cannot see how this reference can be supportive of the statement mentioned in the paper. So that is just to me inaccurate. Referencing okay enough criticizing other people's work, no, not enough. Yet I have one more step, sorry. So if there is any doubt still that the paper of helping in nature had an effect on the use of these terminologies, i'll give you some statistics as well. 
So if you look at all papers of crowd dynamics, helvin's paper gets cited. in almost a quarter of them. In almost one quarter of the whole papers of graph dynamics, you see a reference to help take a helmet's paper in nature 2000. But when you look at the subset of papers that do mention controversial terms in their titles or abstracts or keywords, the in almost 40 percent of them helping speaker is cited. 
So there's a correlation between citing helping's paper and the use of controversial terminologies in crowd dynamics research. So I rest my case about that thing. So that has that has had an effect in the use of these terminologies and probably the most prominent effect in this area. But let's gossip who is using these terms? Who are the authors and crowd dynamics that are using these terms? 
Yours truly is also included in the in the in this in this map. That's right so many people. are using. It's more people than we think, but more. Some people are more frequently using these terms. Some people some of our dear colleagues from china who are contributing to this domain they do use this language. Some of the colleagues that I have co authored with, such as magic survey, they use this language. 
For example, near dr shivakoti did his phd on the topic of panic. So in all of his publications essentially which we used, in which he used ant experiments, he did drop the word panic because the focus of the work was back then it was trendy. 
But back then these discussions probably had not taken effect as much as they have now, and he used a lot of that language in his publications and that reflected in, for example, his co authors publications, magic survey. I have used the term blank in various. papers such as panic, irrationality and hurting, or some of the papers that I that I have in the context of social influence. 
I had to put the term herding in the title so that the paper gets noticed, but I usually put it in quotation marks or I refer to it as hair behavior, or I say the hair type behavior, so I try to moderate it a little bit. 
But I know that if I don't use the term then somebody is working on the topic of social influence might not notice my paper just because I don't use the language that they want me to use. So that there is this conflict that we are facing when we're presenting our paper. Do you, do we want to use our you know punchline to get the attention of other people, or do we want to get to? 
Stick to our principles. So I try to do something in between. A little bit more gossip for you also to show that to show how big a hypocrite I am I when I was doing developing this crowd modeling software. 
Now I'm not sure if you probably know me as a person working in empirical domain, but I've not really noticed that I developed a pedestrian simulation model at the time that I was doing those experiments and as I was developing this model and in collaboration with magic saturday, he really wanted the software to be called throughout panic's modeler and obviously I didn't care enough to challenge that name. 
I thought, as long as the features of the model are consistent with my preferences, I would be happy so I did not care about the terminology that we were using. So if you go to this. paper and if you go to the supplementary material of this paper, you will see this video visualization and in the corner you will see the name crowd panic model. Well, the name of that. 
This software has changed numerous times since then, but back then, obviously, and I didn't care enough to argue against using the term. So how is that for some departments and also the names that I showed, you is not the only people who are using the language. Those were the main stream of people interrupt dynamics that are using this language. 
There are a whole lot of people that have dropped these terms in at least two publications and in their title titan and abstract, not just in the body of the paper, and at least 2.275 authors have mentioned these terms in at least two publications. So I got a little bit. suspicious of that. I thought it cannot be this many. 
I and I started, you know, verifying these notes of authors, and I actually was able to identify the papers where they used the term panic. So it is real. At least 275 people have used this language. But you should also bear in mind that not everybody uses this language with the same sentiment. 
Some people some influential authors in this space, such as john jury versus or his co authors, and they have used this language because they criticize the notion behind the theory of panic, so they have no choice but to use the language. So it's a mixture. Some people who use the language use this in support of the theory. 
Some people are using it more critically, including myself, I would like to see and when you look at the country of origin of these. publications well, obviously, publications coming from china are more representative, but also you should bear in mind that chinese academics are contributing the most to the builder crowd dynamics, so it is expected that their representation in the subset of papers that use controversial language is a bit more noticeable. 
Once you normalize this number based on the number of papers that each country contributes to the field, the proportion of the papers that and you consider the proportion of the papers coming from each country that use the controversial language. Actually, australia stands out so and you know why. 
Now, based on the content that I presented earlier, you know why australia is actually the most contributing to the use of controversial language, proportion wise, based on the number of pages and proportional to the number of papers that are emerging, and this is a little bit about an. upcoming work that you're doing with claudio. 
He's leading this, this effort, and I am I have the pleasure of being part of it and he is looking at the you know media reporting. He has probably covered this in his keynote speech in head. I'm not sure. 
We are looking at the media coverage of all the reports on crowd accidents since 1902. We are talking about some 300 reports of media or 300 accidents, and this is based on the first 100 accidents in which we look at the accidents before 2000, from 1902 to 2000, and when you look at the frequency of the mention of the terms, it's actually the opposite to academic language. 
In academic language, panic is the dominant term, but when you look at the language of the media, this stampede is the language that is predominant. So we are curious to know. if we look at the more contemporary versions of the media, if you see the same effect or if you see a different pattern. We haven't done that yet. 
This is work in progress, but I just wanted to give you a heads up and some brief, you know overview of the work that we are doing in space, led by claudio peliciani. Okay, we are getting to the end points. So what have been the implications of the use of panic? 
One implication has been that it is justified people using of non human entities for their for the evacuation experiments, something that I really do not condone and I don't recommend. so since 2018. You might have noticed that the use of these, sorry, the use of these animal experiments have dropped, and honestly, since 2019. I have not seen a single experiment in using mice or ants for their evacuation experiments. 
So fortunately the language, the conversations that have been going on has had some effect in this space. Another issue about irrationality is that it completely ignores the fact that in a fight and flight situation, we have observed when you increase the stress level, when you increase the urgency level in the event, in the in experimental context, in simulative simulated evacuation scenarios, people actually show behavior that is more efficient compared to low urgency levels. 
So when you increase the level of urgency, the optimality of people's actions become even better, become more they show decisions that are more optimal. So the notion that as people get. into a life threatening situations. They show irrational behavior might not necessarily be supported by empirical evidence. Actually, I have observed a lot of evidence to the contrary of it in a simulated evacuation experiments that I have conducted and analyzed. These are the issues with panic. 
So we do not like to use panic. We instead recommend that the panic be substituted by more miserable and operationalizable language, such as the effect of stress or urgency level on people's behavior and similar to that for rationality or irrationality. We recommend that this does not contribute to the field and it is best if it is substituted by the notion of optimality. 
When you use, rationality has a very specific definition in, for example, in the literature of economics, and when you use it, people get confused that are you using it in relation to the definition of economics until? 
Unless you come up with a clear definition for rationality, I think the use of it is going to be detrimental to your research, and I think that if you use the term optimality, it will be more understandable for an academic audience in this particular field. 
And bear in mind that when we talk about the notion of optimality can be analyzed at the individual level or at the system level, and regardless of that you need to establish a benchmark reference in order to measure optimality against. But that's besides the point. I think the mere use of optimality as a terminology would guide our research efforts in a better direction, because the term is neutral. 
The term allows for people's actions to be optimal or sub optimal, whereas irrationality implies the fact that people's actions are already sub optimal. Similar thing with bernie herding is also a. pre loaded language predisposed with the notion that people tend to imitate in all of their actions during an emergency scenario. 
But in the paper panic, irrationality and learning, we have put together all the empirical evidence related to social influence, and the evidence points out to the fact that not in every scenario people tend to imitate it. There is much nuance involved. It depends on what type of behavior you're looking at. It depends on the context. In some contexts and some in relation to some aspects of behavior. People do not tend to imitate. 
Rather they tend to do the opposite behavior. They tend to avoid the action of majority. But when you use the term herding, it does not leave any space for non imitative behavior. It is already mentioned. It is already loaded with the with the connotation of early with the connotation of immediate. imitation or imitative behavior, and also, when you use the term early, it kind of ignores all other contributing factors in people's decision making. 
Research has shown that people's decision making is not based on a single factor. People use a whole range of factors in their decision making, in their evacuation decision making, and social influence is just one of those, whereas when you use the term herding, it gives the impression that people's decision making is purely based on the action of others and does not leave with the any room for the role of any contributing factor. 
So, as ann mentioned beautifully in her presentation, I think that this term should be substituted by terms such as social influence, peer behavior or peer influence or things to that effect. We are not policing, we are not making rules. These are just recommendations. Right and yes, I just. sum up on the term hurting. Make sure that you differentiate between various aspects of people's behavior when it comes to peer influence. 
Peer influence in the action to initiate evaluation could be different compared to peer influence in exit choice compared to peer influence in exit choice changing behaviors. So the role of peer behavior should be studied in relation to each aspect of behavior separately and also don't forget the role of contextual moderating factors, density level, the level of urgency in the environment, the familiarity of the person with the space, the size of the venue. 
They all tend to modulate the role of behavior and also don't forget the role of individual differences. Not everybody acts the same. Some people tend to imitate, some people tend to not imitate, and the role of individual differences should be considered in this space as well that. wraps up my talk and I really appreciate you listening and really looking forward to your questions. Thank you very much. Thanks milad. 
Thanks for the very nice presentation and interesting content. So we are very short with time. So first I do my homework and I just repeat that if you want to keep yourself updated on these type of events, sign up at the link that I put here in the chat, where you will get information about the next webinars and activities of the umbrella in fires ifss permanent group we have. 
We are over time, but if it's okay with the speakers, we can have just a couple of questions very quickly, and I mean if people have to jump off for the next meeting. I hope it's not a problem. 


Open discussion

I just picked some of the questions because there were a lot of comments. in the chat, which is nice, that this sparked a lot of interest. There was one question from mike kinsey that he mentioned. 
Could this be magnified by the fact that we have non native english speakers? So can this be linked to the fact that non native english speakers do not appreciate their honest use of the word panic, ann or milad? Do you have some comments on this? Oh, would you like me to go both? Okay, go for it you go first, sure, thank you. Well, absolutely, and also social media. Well, we have our own platform, twitter. 
We are connected onto either, and we all, as a result of that we can. We can share all these ideas, and you should bear in mind that authors from some other countries they are not necessarily on these social media platforms typically and they do not use absolutely. english language as a first language as well, so the combination, I think, is effective. I think social media is a bigger factor. 
For example, how many of our top authors, our internal dynamics, are present on twitter? How many of them are involved in these conversations and how many of them can be put these things on twitter? When we share these sentiments on twitter in our tweets, how many of them get exposed to it? Probably not many. I think that's a that's a factor that makes our message not get across to. 
You know certain areas of the world and do you want to comment as well? Yeah, I would echo that. I do think that panic is. I called it a catch all term, and I call it a catch all term because we tend to say panic when we see any kind of fleeing behavior. or anything that we think looks like people acting a crowdflight in a kind of extreme way. 
So it's very easy to just say: oh that's panic, and I think that's why it's so important that we actually dissect. What do we mean by panic? It's actually people are alarmed that they're uncertain. Are they fearful? But panic has. The problem with using panic. Is that casual term? Is that it has these connotations of irrational, individualistic panic, and actually the evidence doesn't hold up. 
That's what happens most of the time, and also as malad touched on his presentation as well. When we talk about panic as an explanation for behavior, it's often used to say this is why there was an accident and the evidence doesn't hold up for that. Either there is very little evidence that irrational panic occurs or that is what is responsible for crushes. for example looking at that systematic review mentioned. 
So I guess in a nutshell, yeah, I think it's easy to say this is because of panic, because panic can explain so many different types of behaviors. If we're changing language, we want to be more specific, which we should be. If we really want to understand why and how people are feeling my behavior is happening, we need to come up with better, more nuanced terms for explaining it. 
And I just have one last follow up question. We had a lot of interesting comments in the chat and also good references. I saw, I think a few, let's say, very known papers and references about the use of the word panic and so on. But there is one general question that we have from reno, from mass university: how can we stop median people using the p word so? how can we get this not to happen? 
So what are the actions that we should do concretely? Because I mean milad, you talk about social media and so on. Well, what else could we do as authors in this field? Only people like john dory can do that. They can write letters to the editors of journals and newspapers and they publish those letters only. 
So yeah, I we can't, john, truly can I mean one follow up on this is that maybe we should have a more collective effort from the field, like the fire field, pedestrian vacation dynamics field. If we put together a letter with the 300 or 400 signatures and we send it to nature, maybe we have hope that it gets published and this stops, but one individual is. You know it's much harder when you have a collective. 
It's much better. I don't. know and any other idea. No, I think that's exactly right, and I've saw so many comments in the chat that are fantastic, including about you know critiquing those ideas and peer review and I talk. When I talk to the media, I get asked about panic quite a lot. You know, if something like astroworld happens, get called to explain it. 
I get asked about panic and I think it's just being very clear about the issues with using the terminology, but unfortunately we're up against journalists who are trying to get the articles out there and panic sells right. That sensationalist approach sells. That's what was getting in the headlines, and so I think really a collective effort is a good idea if we all start saying: well, when you say panic, what do you mean? 
Is it this and giving the alternative more nuanced explanations hopefully are. still attractive and selling the papers, or more accurate. I think it's important we do that, especially if you want to understand you know why behavior is actually happening. Thanks and thanks for the nice comments and thanks milad as well. 
I think we have to wrap up because we're already five minutes over time, so I thank anyone for joining in today and it's very nice to see that these events are well attended, and we will also post this on our youtube channel. So I put the link to keep updated on the next events. Me and erica. 
We are already having a lot of ideas about the next event, so stay tuned and thank everyone and thank again the speakers. So bye everyone. Thank you all. Hi, thank you, thanks so much everyone.
