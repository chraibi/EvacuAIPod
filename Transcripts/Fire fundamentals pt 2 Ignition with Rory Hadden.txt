 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Some weeks ago I've had an episode with Dr. Rory Haddon of University of Edinburgh, where we've discussed some basics of flaming combustion and flames. And it has been a very popular episode, and many of you have asked to bring more fundamentals into the Fire Science Show. So we did and I've invited Rory once again. Today we are discussing the concepts related to ignition, which are also quite fundamental to understand the flame spread, the flammability of materials, what makes some materials more flammable than others and what are the physical mechanisms that lead to ignition, what are the ignition sources, so a lot of interesting things, things that may not necessarily be directly applied to fire safety engineering, but definitely useful concepts to understand as a fire safety engineer. So I really hope you will enjoy this episode. I guess there's no need to introduce this anymore. Last episode was really wildly popular, so I really hope this one is up to your liking as well. So yeah, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host.

OFR, thank you for being a patron of this show. And thanks to you being able to make this content for everyone. And now back to your Fundamentals with Rory. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Fire Fundamentals Part 2, again with Rory Hadden from University of Edinburgh. Hey, Rory. Hey, Rory. How's it going? Very good. Very good. Thank you. I'm not sure if we should call it Fire Fundamentals now. It's going to be Advanced Fire Science. Let's not say that. Maybe someone will turn off. It Let's not say that. Maybe someone will turn off. It's fundamentals. It's going to be great. We're going to talk about how astonishingly fireproofed materials can ignite and ignition in general. How do you like the topic? I think that sounds fantastic, Bartek. Let's do that. Rory, so ignition is a huge chunk of combustion science, and it seems like something that should be very important or even critical to fire safety engineering. Yet, me as a trained fire safety engineer, I don't know that much about the concepts regarding ignition. Of course, we did some laboratories during the school and we did learn some fundamental methods. And I understand some basics behind ignition. But it's not a part of our everyday work. I rarely work on removing or preventing ignition. I'm usually working on stuff that's already burning. How do you feel this concept is positioned in the fire safety engineering world? I think that's a really interesting observation. I think it's one that I've made myself around. Most fire engineers start from the idea that there has been a fire, the fire's already going, and now you have to do something about it. It's kind of taken for granted that a fire will occur. And personally, I think, of course, that is a logical approach. The probability of a building during its lifetime having a fire start, a fire being ignited in that building, is probably quite high. It could be a small fire. It could be a big fire. But the probability of ignition within a building is maybe not 100%, but it's probably quite high that at some point something will ignite. Now, this might be dealt with, you know, by somebody who's in the building. It might be that the ignition occurs and, you know, the intrinsic safety systems and consumer goods or whatever take care of it but the chances of ignition happening within a building is a real chance so most time engineers i think i don't really spend too much time thinking about it but you know if you are a fire investigator you probably will spend quite a lot of time thinking about how a fire started and what the materials first ignited were and figuring out, you know, what is most probable in terms of ignition or indeed trying to make some kind of assessment of the most likely thing to have ignited. So ignition is really at the heart, I would say, of that kind of investigation. But just because fire engineers don't need to worry about how the fire starts, they are generally very interested in how the fire is going to grow and how the fire will spread and the types of materials that will spread flame and how fast they will spread flame. And the logic and the framework that we use to discuss fire spread and flame spread is basically almost exactly the same as the framework that we need to discuss ignition. So there are some very strong links of the concepts in those two phenomena. So by understanding ignition, I think it gives you a really good way to get into understanding flame spread and fire growth, but also understanding materials. There's a lot you can learn from a simple ignition study about how a material will burn and what kind of risk it poses. So in my opinion, anybody working in the fire space should have some solid grasp of the processes that underpin ignition. And I think preventing ignition is at the core of fire safety. We are living in a very flammable world. And the fact it has not burned down, like last time I've checked, is because we're pretty good at preventing accidental ignition. I mean, it happens, of course, but how often it does not happen, and it could have happened, we have absolutely no idea because it's not happening. So it's kind of hidden there. Yeah, it's like many things in fire science, fire engineering, or any safety-based discipline, which is, you know, success is that nothing happens. So it's a little bit difficult to count this easily. But you're right, you know, we are quite good at stopping things catching fire. You know, it's in the interests of product manufacturers and whoever to make sure that their products are as reliable as possible and aren't going to be unduly catching fire. Of course, we live in a world that's powered by energy and energy always brings a risk of ignition. So we really need to manage that somehow. And consumer goods are designed in a pretty good way, I think, to manage that risk. The classic examples of the faulty tumble dryers and these sorts of things that we see a lot, but they're not usually the concern of a fire engineer that kind of comes into the fire investigation world. So understanding how ignition happens, hopefully we'll be able to do that in a relatively simple way here that gives enough of the, some of the fundamentals to show that not only is it kind of cool to understand, but it's really fascinating and it sheds some light on the complexity of a lot of fire problems. And I think, you know, as an academic, somebody whose job it is to find problems, ignition is a great thing to study. But also as somebody who's practicing as an engineer, what you can learn from understanding ignition, I think, is really, really powerful. And my last thought for the introduction, when a large fire happens, like when Grenfell happened, everyone was talking about the initial item that triggered the fire because it ignited. When a large car park burns down, everyone is thinking about, okay, did the electric vehicle ignite it, right? So if you're an engineer working on the fire safety on a building, you do not really have good means affecting the ignition outside of designing the parts of the building that can trigger the ignition. You still have to understand how it can happen to work around it. It's a part of the whole design fire, right? Yeah, I mean, the ignition is a key part of understanding material flammability the ease with which something ignites is a key part of material flammability of course with you know how much energy is released whilst it's burning and all these other aspects but ease of ignition is one of the simplest ways of determining the hazard that is posed by a material or by an object or a product or whatever so um i think it's really I think it really goes to the heart of fire science and fire safety engineering. Okay, let's go there. So what's the easiest one? I guess gases. Yeah, sure. Let's start with gases. Then we can maybe move up to liquids, and then what most fire engineers will deal with, which will, of course, be solid materials, will end up there. Fantastic. And from the last Fire Fundamentals episode, I hope listeners have a good grasp of the combustion processes and the flames. And we've already discussed some aspects of ignition in there. We've discussed how it is the gaseous phase that is undergoing the combustion. So essentially, to burn, you have to turn something into gas in one way or another, at least if we're talking about flaming combustion. So how does a cloud of gases ignite? Like, what's happening there? So when we're talking about clouds of gases, that is perhaps the simplest form of ignition. And the ignition of a gas is really all about getting the right mixture of that flammable gas with air. And these flammable mixtures have been pretty well studied over the last hundred years or so. And there are huge databases that explore the flammability of gases. And most of the work is done using standardized apparatuses, where you introduce a known concentration of gas into an oxidizing atmosphere, usually for fires, it's air that we're interested in. The concentration of fuel is varied. You start off with no fuel, but of course, it won't ignite. You add a little bit of fuel, and then you introduce a spark, and you try to create an ignition of that mixture, which is usually measured by the propagation of a pressure wave or a flame through that mixture. If your mixture doesn't ignite, you increase the concentration and you try again. Right. And you do this kind of incremental approach until you get ignition and a big bang, usually. until you get ignition and a big bang, usually. And then you keep introducing more and more fuel until you get to the point where you no longer get a bang and you no longer have ignition. What you've done there is you've found what we would call the lower flammability limit and the upper flammability limit for that gaseous species. And these are critical, right? The idea of flammability limits, sometimes they're called explosive limits, is really powerful in terms of understanding the hazards posed by materials. Usually, the flammability limits for gases are actually quite low, surprisingly low. For natural gas, for methane, the flammable range is between about 5% of concentration in air by volume up to about 15%. So if you have less than 5% methane in your air mixture, it won't ignite. There's not enough energy released to sustain an ignition. And if you have more than 15% concentration of methane in air, then it also won't ignite. You've not got enough air to allow that chemical reaction to go to completion. So this idea of flammability limits is pretty well established. And you can go to the SFP handbook or Drysdale's textbook, and you can find tables of this data. And you can use that to look at hazards. Is it any way related to the energy of the source? Like if I have more powerful source, can I ignite it beyond the flammability limits? That's a really good question. The flammability limits are sensitive to what we can call the ignition energy. So there's usually also presented in these tables something called the minimum ignition energy. And that is the energy that you need in a spark in order to ignite the mixture. And that can vary quite a lot. But usually once you have enough energy from the spark, it doesn't matter if you make the spark bigger, right? Ignition is kind of a yes or a no. That becomes really interesting when, if you were, for example, doing a fire investigation and looking at types of ignition sources, and if you were assigning it to an electrical fault or something, you know, is it possible to actually get enough energy in a spark to ignite some mixtures? to actually get enough energy in a spark to ignite some mixtures. So I think the minimum ignition energy thing is really interesting. The other thing, though, is if you have a flame, then more or less a flame is capable of igniting any flammable mixture. And that's because within the flame, you've got all of the radicals and all of the intermediate species that are formed that are super reactive that will react straight away. So going back to the energy of the ignition source, I always found it interesting why it is defined in energy. Like why not like in some sort of energy density or temperature? Like if I have a given amount of joules, but they're in a large volume, will they cause an ignition? I guess, yeah, you're right. So this is one of these ideas about what causes ignition. Is it simply energy or is there some other kind of metric in there as well? And you're right, there is usually some other kind of metric in there as well. But these are energies of sparks, and that is quite a different... So I guess this comes down to the way how it's being tested. Like any method, you know, the result is dependent on the test. So in the spark, of course, you would have a huge energy density inside the spark because it's an arc that was powerful enough to make a piece of air glow. So that's... Exactly. If you think about what the spark is there to do, basically, the spark, the reason you get that flow of electricity through the air, which is normally an insulator, is because the spark breaks down the air molecules and ionizes them and it creates a conductive path, basically. So when you do that, you also create all those weird intermediate species, the radicals, and you provide energy also into the fuel molecules to help pyrolyze and break them down as well. So the spark is doing all of that work for you in that gaseous mixture. And what if I just keep warming my gases? How will they ignite? Yeah, sure. So, okay, that's a good one. First of all, she mentioned the flammability limits are, of course, functions of temperature and pressure. Usually higher temperatures and higher pressures widen the flammability limits. So the numbers I quoted before for methane would be at standard temperatures and standard pressures. Fair enough. So if you heat it up, the chances of getting a flammable mixture are higher. If you keep heating it, you can, of course, get to auto-ignition of the mixture. And kind of a canonical problem from the first half of the 20th century, where it was a very important part of understanding combustion systems, was to understand these sorts of auto-ignition phenomena. And the work of Semenov, for example, is one of those really fundamental, classical, foundational pieces of work, the ignition of well-stirred mixtures. So if you heat it up, you will eventually get to that auto-ignition, because instead of the spark breaking the molecules down, simply there's enough thermal energy there to start the chemical reaction, because all chemical reactions have an activation energy associated with them. And really to get the reaction going, you've got to overcome that activation energy. You've got to raise the energy state of the... So once this energy is passed, the reaction begins and it's like, then it's exothermic, so it produces more heat and it's going on, right? Yeah, if you have the right conditions, the exothermic reaction allows it to propagate through the mixture. Yeah, absolutely. That's cool. And the same effort can be achieved by just squeezing it, like introducing additional pressure, and here we discover diesel engine, I guess. Absolutely. The diesel engine or, I guess, getting some engine knock on your petrol engine. If you compress it whilst everything's hot, you can get the ignition to happen basically at the wrong time. So, I mean, a lot of the work we understand on ignition comes from that space. It comes from optimizing internal combustion engines to make sure you get as much power for the fuel that you're using. And really, a lot of that literature is where we understand most about ignition. It's from that context. I wonder also in terms of gases, you said about this minimum energy of the ignition source. I wonder, for example, does a static electricity have sufficient amount of energy inside to trigger gaseous ignition? I mean, can do. It's possible. There are some videos I've seen, I mean, of course, you also take with a grain of salt, where you can see ignition of gas clouds from static discharge. Of course, it depends. A static can be a lot for a lift as well. So it depends on the magnitude of that discharge. But it's not as simple as any spark will ignite any mixture. But, you know, we know, for example, that it's much harder to ignite a dust cloud than it is to ignite a vapor cloud. We know that, for example. But beyond that, I mean, I think it's quite tricky. There's still perhaps some work to be done in that area for application to a fire context. I mean, in terms of very clean mixtures of gases and air, there's some very nice relationships about ignition energy and the species that you have present. But for, let's say, real-world applications, it's not so clean. I also think that a purely gaseous setting would be something not very, very common for the fire safety engineer point of view, because it's quite challenging. I would agree to her point. I mean, I think, you know, if you're working in petrochemicals or anything like that, of course, that's going to be a problem. But also, I mean, the energy transition is happening. People are talking about hydrogen as an energy vector. We're going to be having to deal with hydrogen systems, and fire engineering needs to figure out how it wants to do that. And when you talk about hydrogen, I mean, the flammability limits of hydrogen are something like 4% to 75%. They're enormous. Not to mention the fact that hydrogen flame is invisible. There's all sorts of problems with this. So, again, understanding, having some appreciation of the additional hazard. I mean, if you look at the flammability range of methane, 5 to 15, and then you go 4 to 75, well, that's a whole different challenge, potentially, of managing that hazard than fire engineers are used to. So, I think, again, just being aware of this so that you can play a part in those discussions around the energy transition is super important. Actually, I take that back. I now recall we had a very strong engineering discussion on the liquid propane gas fuel vehicles in Poland, which are very, very popular in Poland. And all the sorts of discussions we see now on electric vehicles, banning them from car parks. We in Poland did that 15 years ago on LPG vehicles. The exact same type of discussion, the same type of issue in a way. Is it safe to introduce pressurized vessel with liquid gas into a car park? This is, I think, again why it's important to be familiar with all these terms, because what are are hazards how do you define the hazards and so on um so yeah ignition of of hydrogen systems is is for me super interesting uh what happens with those uh so yeah but i mean you talked about liquids lpg yeah uh so maybe we can go yeah maybe not to cryogenic liquid that's a little bit different but if we go to regular liquids and talk about the ignition there, because I think many people will have seen these classifications of flammable or highly flammable or combustible liquids. And those are all definitions of different levels of hazard, effectively. But I mean, how does a liquid burn? Well, or ignite, I should say, it ignites in exactly the same way as a gas. It's the vapor phase, it's the gas phase of that liquid that ignites. And that's an important concept, I think, to understand, which is, you know, if you have a liquid, an open pool of liquid, then that liquid is always exchanging molecules of that liquid with the atmosphere around it. The fancy name for that is the vapor pressure. We don't really need to understand that too much. We just need to recognize that a pool of liquid will always be exchanging molecules of that liquid, whether it's octane or hexane or heptane, acetone, whatever it might be. There will be molecules that will escape from the surface of the liquid and enter the atmosphere. And this is the way that it might be a little bit confusing to think of at first first, but I mean, if you think of how a puddle evaporates, in Scotland it rains a lot, but we don't have to boil the puddles to make them evaporate. They eventually just go on their own. And the reason that they go is because those molecules leave the surface of the liquid and normally are blown away by the wind, which means that more molecules can leave the surface of the liquid and normally are blown away by the wind, which means that more molecules can leave the surface of the liquid and be blown away. If we close that system, and if you're a lid, when you close the lid of your water bottle, the level stays the same, right? It doesn't evaporate. If you have a glass of water, eventually that glass of water will evaporate. In the world of fire science, that's exactly what firefighting foams are doing to pool fires. That's how you extinguish them. You make a layer that separates fluids, liquids that's burning from the atmosphere, right? You create a, I think the fancy term might usually be a mass transfer barrier, right? You prevent the transfer from the liquid, the flammable liquid into the paper. I would say you make it astonishingly fireproof. Somehow, yes. So, yeah, so when you have a liquid, I mean, that exchange of atoms, sorry, exchange of molecules is really what's governing the whole process because, as we know, flames are gas phase phenomena. So we have to get things into the vapor phase or into the gas phase in order for the combustion reaction to occur. And really after that, it's exactly the same problem as with the gases. It's getting enough of the vapor to the vapor phase so that you reach the lower flammability limit again in order to get ignition. And most of the time with looking at hazardous liquid fuels, the upper flammability limit is not so relevant because you're going to get ignition at the lower flammability limit or near that. And then, you know, you've got the flame there, you're going to be consuming the fuel. So you'll never really get to that point. Well, if your liquid vaporizes in a way that fuels the whole compartment, you're pretty much dealing with a gas problem again. Absolutely. It's interesting when it's like a pool and it's constantly producing this fuel or or your liquid fuel is constantly producing the gas phase at the rate that allows for the flame to sustain. I guess that's the challenge. Right. And that's there's a subtle distinction there because what we will often measure and people might be familiar with the concept of a flashpoint, defining the hazard associated to a liquid fuel. And in general, you know, a lower flashpoint is a higher risk material, easier to ignite that material. One example is hexane has a flashpoint of minus 22 degrees Celsius. So that's pretty low. Methanol, methylated spirits, it's about 12 degrees Celsius. So even for quite common fuels, we can have quite big ranges in the flammability in the flashpoint data. But the flashpoint is really defined as when the vapor phase concentration is equal to the lower flammability limit. So when you're running the test and there are closed cup flashpoint tests, different apparatuses for that, they're standardized in various ways. What you normally do is you heat a small volume of liquid and then you introduce a flame or a spark into the headspace on that liquid. And what you normally see at the flash point is, well, a flash, right? You see a flash of flames propagating through the vapor phase. But then it goes out, right? The rate of vaporization is not sufficient to sustain the flame. And the energy feedback from the flame back to the surface of the liquid is not so high in that context. What's the difference between open cup and closed cup? And don't tell me it's the openness of the cup. I mean, that's exactly what the difference is. The open cup and the closed cup flashpoint are two different ways of measuring it. The closed cup, the real difference with the closed cup method is you have a much closer, almost perfect equilibrium between the vapor phase and the gas phase. And not wanting to get too much into the thermodynamics of things, that gives you probably a more repeatable test because your vapor phase and your liquid phase are in equilibrium. You can hold it at that temperature for as long as you like to do the test that you're doing. And the open cup, you don't have that equilibrium. The vapor phase can diffuse away from the surface of the liquid. So you have a concentration gradient from the surface of the liquid to wherever your ignition source is, which is absent in the closed cup. In the closed cup, you've got a uniform vapor concentration. In the open cup, you've got this concentration gradient. So different test methods, and of course, it will give different results, right? Typically, the flashpoint temperature is higher in an open cup than in a closed cup test because of that diffusion away and the dilution, if you like, of the gases for a fixed temperature of the liquid. The nice thing about the open cup test, though, is it allows you to also determine the fire point of the liquid and the fire point is different from the flash point usually by a few degrees um the fire point allows you to have sustained burning so you introduce your pilot flame and you get sustained burning of the liquid and and that's because you've heated the liquid sufficiently that the rate of vaporization is enough to continuously feed a flame uh and that's a distinction that, you know, isn't used too much because, you know, let's be a little bit conservative and we'll use the flashpoint number to make sure that we are going to be in a conservative place. But, you know, these things are also important. poured lots of gasoline around in a building to try and set a fire, waited too long, struck a match, put it in there and basically created a vapor cloud explosion, which has usually caught them by surprise one way or another. So this idea of flammable vapors and liquids, I think is really interesting. But, you know, again, probably not too everyday, let's say for a fire engineer, because most fire engineers will be working with solid materials. But guess what? We can also apply the same logic that we've just applied to gases and liquids to solids. Okay. So when we're igniting a solid, what are we trying to do? Well, we're trying to heat that solid up so that we force it to undergo pyrolysis. force it to undergo pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is basically a fancy word to say breaking down of the molecular chain that forms that solid material into short chunks. The short chunks are usually volatile. They're usually going to be in the vapor phase or in the gas phase, and then we can ignite that. And there are loads of standardized methods for doing this, the cone calorimeter, the fire propagation apparatus, whatever. And you can take a sample, expose it to some kind of heating, and then you will be able to, with a pilot flame or a pilot spark, depending on your apparatus, achieve ignition when you have pyrolyzed enough material. And so it's exactly the same concept, right? It's this idea of getting the material pyrolyzed at a sufficient rate that you can get sustained ignition on the material. But it's not about just igniting the phase. It's about getting to that equilibrium with sufficient energy that can initiate the process. In a way, the process is ongoing on its own, right? So this is quite an interesting thing about how we do ignition in this in the solid phase is anybody who's run a cone calorimeter test um or even somebody who's you know really paid attention while starting a campfire or barbecue you'll quite often see flashes on a solid surface or near the salt surface before you get you know a strong sustained ignition um and what those flashes are it's kind of similar to the flash point of a liquid fuel, which is you're producing flammable gases, but not really at enough rate to sustain a flame at a given position on the surface. So that process is quite complicated, right? I think you can probably see when you've got gases or vapors being evolved from the surface of a solid and then burning in the gas phase with a pilot flame there to get that ignition going so actually what fire science has done when it comes to understanding ignition is to like cancel the gas phase right we've decided that actually coupling solid phase and gas phase and ignition is too complicated um so what we're going to do is just get rid of the gas phase and turn ignition of solid fuels into a solid only problem. Okay. And I think that's really useful because what that allows us to do is to come up with the idea of the critical heat flux for ignition, which is the minimum heat flux that you need to supply to the surface of a solid fuel to get it to ignite. The number most people are familiar with is 12.5 or whatever, something in the order for building separation calculations, 12.5 kilowatts per square meter. The interesting thing about that is that doesn't really account for the gas phase, that's piloted ignition. So in this case, we're forcing the experiment or the test to give us ignition. But 12.5 kilowatts, I mean, many things have a critical heat flux around that, whether they're synthetic polymers or natural polymers. And the reason for that is because we test it in a standardized apparatus. You know, the sample dimensions are prescribed. The way you heat it is prescribed. The boundary conditions are all prescribed. So this is, let's be clear, these results, just like the flash point, just like the flammability limits, are situation and test dependent. Well, what we've done, let's go back to solid ignition, and we've got the idea of the critical heat flux. The other thing that people will be familiar with is, I suppose, an ignition temperature. Wait, I'm going to stop you before we go into that. But then I do my experiments with timber structures, and I see the surface after the char is formed. I can see flames on the surface. I understand what my heat flux is on this surface, and I know it's astonishingly high, even though it's astonishingly fireproof material. It ignited and burned and then I'm having very large heat fluxes and the flaming combustion stops on the surface. Does this mean I run out of the phase that could go into gas phase and I'm left only with basically cold and must smolder? No. So that's how materials burn and how they ignite. It's not so simple to draw straight lines between those two concepts. But back to the idea of sustaining a flame requires that you produce pyrolysis gases at a sufficient rate. And when you have a charring solid, in the beginning, you have pure solid and no char. As it burns, you start to turn the solid into gases and also the char that is left behind as a solid residue. But the material properties of the char are very different from the timber. And that changes the whole energy balance around how something will burn. And eventually the energy balance is tipped into the favor that not enough energy is being conducted into the material in order to sustain sufficient rate of pyrolysis. And as soon as you don't have enough pyrolysis, the concentration near the surface of the solid drops below the flammable limit, and then it can't sustain a flame anymore. So again, the concepts of ignition and flammable limits and that kind of thing can help you understand even the burning of materials. That was exactly the point of the question. It's not just like 12 kilowatts, it's burning and will, because it's more complicated than that. It's a balance of many, many things, production of the gas phase and the availability of oxygen, the heat transfer that's coming and all changing in time and space. Absolutely. And I mean, I think burning and flame spread, very happy to have another one of these on those topics as well, because that's a whole level of interesting stuff, I think, going on under those categories as well. But the idea of producing enough pyrolysis gases is key. And I think, you know, people often forget about that when we talk about the burning or the ignition of solids, because of the way we've constructed the problem as fire engineers, because of the way we've tried to cancel the connection between the gas phase and the solid phase. For good reason, right? Because it's really hard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So how do we do it? So we get rid of that because we put a pilot flame so we can be sure as soon as we get that flammable mixture, it will ignite. So we have this energy density we need to start. We have something that will trigger that as soon as the conditions around are okay. So you can put a heat flux onto the surface of the solid and you can when you find a critical heat flux which is the minimum level of heating that you can put and still get ignition you can do some fancy maths and from that you can calculate an ignition temperature but that ignition temperature is truly a construct a mathematical construct it doesn't really have any physical meaning, in my opinion. Potentially other people have different opinions on this, but for me, the ignition problem isn't defined by the surface temperature reaching some threshold. It's defined by creating a flammable mixture in the gas phase, right? Because we decided to cancel the gas phase, it was too complicated. You end up having these surrogate variables like ignition temperature or critical heat flux for ignition. Now, I think that what would be more sensible to talk about if we want to keep things focused on the solid phase would be a kind of critical mass loss rate for ignition instead of heat flux or instead of a temperature. How would you define that? You would define it in exactly the same way. You would weigh the sample as you heat it. And then when you get ignition, you would take that data point of the mass loss rate. Now, we've been trying that and it's not actually so straightforward. There are one or two problems with doing that measurement. But that is a more fundamental approach, in my opinion. And of course, the other part here that I've always found a little bit interesting, I suppose, is the idea that if you run some thermogravimetric analysis, you can identify a pyrolysis temperature for your solid. But if you run a comb calorimeter study and you calculate the ignition temperature, you get a different answer. And, of course, pyrolysis is a key process, right? We have to have pyrolysis before we can have ignition. You know, why is there this difference between pyrolysis temperature or the onset of pyrolysis in a TGA and the ignition temperature in a cone calorimeter or a fire propagation apparatus? And the reality is it's because the latter is a complete construct. And of course, there's problems with the former as well around the scale of the sample and whatever. But for me, the ignition temperature for a solid is when the surface reaches the pyrolysis temperature or actually when sufficient volume of the material is heated. Because again, we relate everything to the surface because mathematically that's easier. But actually, we have to recognize that it's a volume that's always being heated when it comes to ignition. So, I mean, all of this can get quite complicated, right, in terms of ignition. But at the end of the day, whether it's a gas, a liquid, or a solid, you're always looking at creating a flammable mixture in the vapor phase near a competent pilot source. Going back to the construct of the ignition temperature, to what extent I make an error putting that as a trigger to my framing to start if I do FDS simulations, for example? To be honest, I have no idea what level of error you get on that. It might probably depend on many of the other assumptions that you make. But I've seen, for example, if you run TGA on some materials, you will find an ignition or pyrolysis temperature, an ignition or pyrolysis temperature, the onset of pyrolysis around 300 degrees Celsius. But if you run a cone calorimeter study, you might find an ignition temperature of 400, 450 degrees Celsius. So that can vary quite a lot. Now, whether that matters or not for any given application, I think is probably a little bit more nuanced than just those two numbers. But I think, nevertheless, what's important is simply to recognize what we mean when we say ignition temperature and where that comes from, right? It's not an inherent material property, quite the opposite. It's a material property that is entirely dependent on the test setup and the boundary conditions that we're using. And at some point, I was exposed to some other way to positioning that, and that was highly relevant to simulations. And that was the concept of flux time product. Are you familiar with that? Yes. This is something that, if I understand correctly what you mean, basically you have a a heat flux applied for a certain duration and the product of those two things gives you whatever and i think i would call that like a dose response approach to mission and it doesn't work yeah it doesn't work um it's it's very simplified way of doing it it's something that i've seen a few times in in a wildfire context looking at tree mortality and whatever the issue is is that heat transfer problems don't work like that that is not it's not an accumulation it's like right i mean it could work if what people were measuring instead of the incident heat flux uh was the net heat flux so that the actual energy absorbed by the solid then perhaps that kind of product would work but usually people are referring to as an incident heat flux multiplied by a time, and it just doesn't work. It's one of the myths of fire science I would quite like to dispel if I had a magic wand. So, yeah, I think that that's, in terms of good application of science for engineering, I think that's not a good way to go. But if you apply it with a net heat flux, you say it could have worked? Because there is a transient component to that. If you have a certain heat flux, even at a cone, some stuff ignites at 50 at 25 kilowatts. In 25, it will just take longer to ignite. At 50, it will take shorter, right? Yeah, but if you plot those data, you see it's highly nonlinear. You know, it's, so it's not, it's just not as simple as that. Because when you, the longer you heat something, the more time you have for energy to be conducted through the solid. So, you know, you're losing energy, potentially more energy out of the back of the solid, on the face opposite the heated face, I guess. And then if you heat something very quickly with a high heat flux. So your whole energy balance changes completely. And that actually leads us quite nicely into some of the other important concepts for a solid ignition that you don't see in liquids or gases, which is the idea of thermally thick and thermally thin solids. So anybody who's built a campfire knows this stuff, right? It's very easy to ignite thin materials. Pieces of paper are quite easy to ignite. And a big log will stand in the middle of a campfire until the next day. The big log will stay for the next day. You know, how you ignite something, where you ignite something really matters. And I would encourage people, you know, go to a safe place and try and ignite a piece of paper in the middle of that piece of paper. Hold a match underneath. Try and do that. And you'll find it's actually surprisingly difficult to ignite a piece of paper in the middle. But of course, if you ignite the edge of the sheet of paper, I mean, it ignites immediately, right? And you have really rapid flame spread. So be careful if you are going to try that. But that, again, just shows how the way you try to ignite something, how you try to ignite it, where you apply the ignition source, all of that really, really matters, even if you just have a thin material. Edges, corners are great places to ignite stuff. And I think intuitively we all know that. You try and start a fire. But the concept of thermally thick and thermally thin is really important in ignition. And, you know, you have completely different relationships on the heat transfer as a result of this definition. And for ignition, you know, mostly things that are thin on the order of a millimeter or less. And what do we mean by that? We mean that you can describe the temperature of the solid basically as one number. The surface is the same temperature. So one side has the same as the other. More or less, yeah, exactly. Those things will ignite really easily. But most solids that we deal with in fire engineering applications are thermally thick solids. And they're much more complex to deal with because you have a fully transient problem. You know, you heat the surface and energy is conducted from the surface into the body of the material. And you're always kind of having a fight between the energy that's arriving at the surface and heating up the surface, driving the pyrolysis and the energy that's lost out through the back. So, again, I mean, if you're looking around for what materials are present, might be hazardous, you know, the thickness of the material is important. But all that means is it's going to take longer. So to go back to the log analogy, you know, of course, it's very easy to ignite small logs and small branches and twigs. But it's also pretty easy to ignite a big log or a big branch if you have enough time. All you've got to do is have a bit more time to heat up that material to basically overcome the conductive losses. So I think that's, you know, when you see, as often you do, somebody applying a blowtorch onto the surface of a material to say, look how fire resistant it is. Astonishing. How fire resistant it is or how not ignitable it is. A very localized heat source, even if it's a massive low-torch flame, putting that on a small area isn't really an ignition test at all, right? Because the ability for a material to conduct energy away from the surface is enormous. Everybody, I think, underestimates how much energy you can move around by conduction. It's huge amounts of energy you can move by conduction. So I think these sorts of tests, and again, just as a fire engineer, recognizing that that's not a great test to look at the ignition of a material or to look at the fire performance of a material. So, yeah, so when it comes to, you know, defining the hazard of ignition in solids, of course, it all comes back to creating this flammable mixture in the gas phase as it does for liquids and as it does for gases but because of the coupling between the solid and the gas phase is not very easy to do with liquids it's great we rely on the vapor pressure very nice and we can calculate that we can work with that quite easily with solids not so easy because this whole pyrolysis phenomena gets in the way and makes things a little bit complicated. So instead, we remove the gas phase and we have this concept of critical heat flux and the concept of the ignition temperature. But the one thing that we haven't really spoken about is the time to ignition. And the time to ignition is also a function of the heat. And probably some of the most famous plots in material flammability are, you know, you plot one over the square root of time to ignition as a function of the instant heat flux, and you get this beautiful straight line as predicted by the mathematical theory. And from that, you can calculate the effective thermal inertia. The thermal inertia is, again, a really good way of understanding the hazard posed by a material, even if you know nothing of the chemistry of the material, provided it's combustible. A material with a low thermal inertia, so something that has a low conductivity, a low density or a low heat capacity, product of those three terms, the thermal inertia will determine to a great extent the speed with which something will ignite. And so low thermal inertia will ignite quickly. Materials with a higher thermal inertia will ignite more slowly. So low thermal inertia things are commonly foams or products, you know, expanded products, one for another. Higher thermal inertia, you know, if you've got sheets of PMMA or if you have, you know, sheets of polycarbonate or those sorts of polymers, they will be of a higher thermal inertia. And it's a very good way of understanding the hazard. I mean, thermal inertia will control the rate of heating of the solid surface, and therefore it will determine how quickly you reach the pyrolysis temperature, how quickly you can produce those flammable gases. So even knowing nothing of the chemical composition of the material, just knowing the thermal conductivity, the density, and the heat capacity, you can get a handle on the time to ignition. So by understanding this fundamental physics that you've been describing, these are essentially the tools that the industry of improving materials in terms of fire resistance can work with. Either dissipating heat, increasing these thresholds at which certain things happen, changing the thermal inertia. Yep. I mean, certainly for reaction to fire or material flammability classifications, manipulating these things is all what you're trying to do in order to improve the fire performance in air quotes of your material. in order to improve the fire performance in air quotes of your material. And, you know, in the end, it's not so many variables that you have to manipulate. And normally the optimization process fire is only a tiny part of that. So, you know, it's unlikely that you're going to be allowed to double the density of your material in order to reduce the time to ignition. So you might have to take other means. You might have to start adding things in. And here we get to the debate of fire retardants and how they work. But basically, a fire retardant is going to do one of a small number of tasks. It's either going to decompose in such a way that it will dilute the pyrolysis gases that are produced, make it harder to reach a flammable mixture. They will absorb a lot of energy. So basically, you put something in there that's just a big heat sink, gets them to absorb lots of energy and basically keep the material cooler for longer. Or the third way that it's going to act is actually chemically, in either the gas phase or the solid phase, perhaps promoting char formation or inhibiting gas phase reactions. So you can start manipulating the chemistry. Manipulating the physical properties is really not so easy phase reactions. So, you know, you can start manipulating the chemistry, manipulating the physical properties is really not so easy because a piece of wood has a density within a very small range. A piece of polycarbonate has a density in a very small range. So, yeah, so, you know, understanding those things and how they come into being in the ignition problem, I think is really powerful for fire engineers, especially when it comes to understanding the hazards posed by materials. I mean, it's almost impossible to understand, you know, from first principles, the hazard of every single material or product that you can come across. But by asking, you know, what is the thermal inertia of material A compared to material B, you might be able to make some informed decisions about, you know, the relative risks of each material. For the end, we need to talk about more things that happen in a solid space that are specific to that type of materials and very interesting as well. That is self-ignition and the ignition that leads to smoldering, not flaming. Yeah, absolutely. Pick one. It's one of my favorite things to talk about because it is a slightly mind-blowing concept and that if you under the right conditions many materials and it's quite a big list of materials will actually spontaneously ignite and now it's important to say that this is not spontaneous human combustion that is complete bs to be honest but you know spontaneous ignition of solids is a thing that can happen. Usually what happens there is you have large quantities of material. That's kind of the underlying theme for spontaneous ignition. So either large accumulations of material being stored somewhere or during transport, bulk transport on ships, spontaneous ignition is a big problem. What is the process of spontaneous ignition is quite straightforward, really. It's basically a feedback. All the time, chemical reactions are happening around us. So oxidation is happening everywhere. Oxygen from the atmosphere is reacting with things. And if you cut an apple, it goes brown because of oxidation. That's a chemical reaction. If you ride a bike and the chain will go rusty, that's a chemical reaction with oxygen as well. The same thing happens with lots of carbon-based materials, you know, grain, biochar, activated carbon, a huge list of things. They will start to oxidize. Now, oxidation reactions are generally exothermic. So the bike chain is oxidizing, but it's not producing a lot of heat and all that heat is lost to the atmosphere almost immediately. But if you've got a large mass of material, then if it starts oxidizing in the middle, it's going to release some energy, but the thermal conductivity of that pile of stuff is going to be quite low. So that energy can't really move anywhere. It can't escape from the region where it was generated. And so it kind of stays there and it heats up the material. But hotter material is going to then be able to undergo more reaction. And all chemical reactions are temperature dependent. So if you heat up the material, the reaction goes faster. So my material oxidizes, releases a small amount of energy. The energy can't be dissipated, so it heats up the material. So that means that the material is hotter, so the chemical reaction can go faster. So in the next time step, if you want to think of it like that, more energy is released more quickly, and that heats up the material even more. And eventually, you get this feedback process that keeps going, keeps going, and you get ignition of the material. And because you've ignited this in the middle of a massive, usually porous material, you can't have a flame. A flame can't exist in that context. So you have a smoldering fire. And a smoldering fire is one that you've talked about before on the podcast. But basically, it's a fire that is heterogeneous. So the oxygen from the air reacts directly on the solid surface. It releases quite a lot of energy, or it can do under the right conditions. But that smoldering fire that's in the middle of your mass of material will propagate in all directions in a kind of a spherical way until it reaches the surface. And then you will potentially get ignition. We do this in our undergraduate labs. We use milk powder. It's a very nice one for doing this. It smells of like burnt sugar afterwards. But we can do that and we do it in the lab. And the reason we can do it in the lab is because we heat it up. So instead of doing spontaneous ignition at ambient temperature, we do spontaneous ignition at elevated temperature. And there's some beautiful theories out there, again, developed, I guess, in the first half of the 20th century, the Frank Kamenetsky theory that allows you to do small-scale temperature, small-scale high-temperature tests and extrapolate back down to room temperature kind of conditions. And, I mean, it's a really fascinating mechanism of ignition because it leads us to all sorts of interesting things, like the transition from smoldering to flaming combustion, and all these kind of unknown parts of fire science that are still on the periphery to be explored. So I think the idea of spontaneous ignition is one that is super interesting and actually quite relevant. There's a lot of fire start in manufacturing plants. Food processing is another one at high risk of spontaneous ignition. Hotel laundries, hospital laundries, where you've got big sacks of towels and bed linens and that kind of thing. You know, these are all places where that is a real threat. And, you know, we have ways of dealing with it. Sometimes you'll see if you are near power stations, you'll see huge machinery deconstructing a pile of coal and like moving it, you know, two or three hundred meters away. The reason they're doing that is to stop the material from spontaneously igniting. You break down the pile, you let everything cool down in the middle and then you reconstruct the pile because spontaneous ignition, although it sounds terrifying, takes a long time to happen. That feedback process starts off very, very, very slow. So, you know, you've usually got days, weeks, months sometimes in order to catch a spontaneous ignition before it goes into what we call thermal runaway. So that's a really important part of ignition of solids, but not one, I guess, that's really related directly to most fire engineers' day-to-day work, which is much more around material classification, reaction to fire, flammability, and that sort of thing. But yes, it's a fascinating topic, that one. Absolutely. Especially if you have a pile of coal to secure. And actually, securing large volumes of materials is something many fire safety engineers do. And it is a huge challenge to deliver the safety when you basically have huge amounts of material that is difficult to control. And you don't really have any good action to mitigate that because you basically have just a pile of material. One of the things I remember reading, and I don't know if it actually came into fruition or not, maybe somebody can write into the podcast to let you know, but when they were converting one of the huge coal-fired power stations in the UK, when they were converting it from coal to biomass, they had to store loads of biomass. So they built these huge domes, filled it with biomass, but to avoid the hazard of spontaneous ignition, they constantly flow nitrogen through this. So there's a huge cost, a huge overhead associated to doing that. But I guess it works out economically for them. But yeah, it just shows that this hazard is everywhere when you look for it. And you just cannot pour water through it because then you will promote biological processes that will make it challenging. Well, absolutely. I mean, once these things have ignited, I mean, one of the most common applications for this is in bulk transport on ships. And actually extinguishing one of these spontaneously ignited fires in a ship's hold is really hard because, you know, you can pump in carbon dioxide, but the carbon dioxide has got to get to the right place. You know, there's no good just having it randomly in the hold. You've got to get enough in to really flood the whole fuel carbon dioxide. You might slow things down, but the chances of stopping it, because once you remove the carbon dioxide and you let oxygen back in, it would restart. Flooding the cargo hold, well, you can't normally do that on a ship because you lose the stability of the vessel and you run all sorts of other risks. So actually fighting these fires is really, really difficult. Really, the only thing you can do in the end, I think, is remove the fuel, you know, start excavating. But then, of course, that has its own problems because you're excavating burning material, and I don't want to write that risk assessment. Well, understanding how ignition happens and the chain of events that leads to that, especially if it takes weeks or months to ignite, is a pretty decent strategy for fire safety. And here we made a full circle why fire safety engineers should learn about ignition, because sometimes you reach a problem in fire safety that can be solved only by reducing ignition. And if with whole certainty you are able to remove the ignition from the equation, your solution is fire safe. Absolutely. I think we have gone full circle. It's very nice. I mean, I always caution against relying on removing the risk of ignition because there's always the risk of the unknown. So it's good to have more than one level in your fire safety strategy around that. But certainly if you can remove ignition, that's the easiest point to prevent your fire becoming a big problem. Rory, thank you so much. That was another not a very introductory lecture. I guess, well, maybe one day we need to do like introduction to introductions or something. But I really enjoyed these fundamentals episodes. And it's really nice to learn these important and challenging concepts that really, in the end, help you do the engineering. Like understanding fire is the first step to prevent fire and prevent fire damage. And that's what most of us would do for a living. So, yeah, thank you for sharing that. No, thank you very much, Wojciech, for having us on. I think I fully agree. You know, if you're in this business, I think, you know, the more you know about this stuff, it can only be helpful. So hopefully it has been helpful. Indeed. So thanks a lot. And I hope to see you here next time with some another interesting. I can actually give you a part of the show. We did this. I really enjoyed this. It's brilliant and the audience loves it. So let's do it again. Thanks so much, Rory, for coming to the show and see you again. No worries, Vasek. Thank you very much. Take care. And that's it. I hope you've enjoyed the Fundamentals with Rory. Perhaps I owe you an explanation for the running joke in the episode about the astonishingly fireproof materials. Just before we recorded this session with Rory, like a day before, some journalist has published a piece on LinkedIn about timber being astonishingly fireproof. And we have literally went on a crusade in social media with Rory against that guy. It was quite funny and, well, funny and sad at the same time because journalism dumbens down some facts of fire science and that's potentially dangerous and something we would not like to see. But I just could not resist calling stuff astonishingly fireproof in the podcast episode, so please excuse me, my bad jokes. Anyway, regarding the fire fundamentals, once again, if you want more of those, please let me know. I'll try to ask him. He seems to be enjoying this and I am certainly enjoying this. If you are enjoying this, then why not make more of those episodes? It's brilliant to learn fire science from some of the world's best educators. Not many people have the privilege to be able to do that. At least if you're not living in Edinburgh, you probably have a much worse access to those academics. So by the means of this podcast, I'm trying to democratize it and bring access to brilliant minds like Rory to everyone. I hope it's a thing we can achieve in the Fire Science Show. I certainly enjoy learning the basics from guys like Rory. It's always nice to refresh and sharpen your mind and talk about basics. And basics are, once you go very deep on them, they are not basic at all. There's always something hiding behind the corner that you did not know. Great experience for me and I hope enjoyable experience for all of you. Not much to add in here. Ignition is certainly an important part of fire science. Not a huge part of fire engineering, I guess, but it's a mean to understand fire spread, flammability and other concepts that are fundamentals for engineers. So, a very important skill to have the knowledge of how things ignite. That would be it for today's episode. Thank you for being here with me and see you here next Wednesday. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
