 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. Summer is rolling out slowly and warmly, but the Fire Science Show is not slowing down. Last week I took you on a trip to fire safety marine vessels. Today we're back on the land and we're touching an important subject of how changes in fire environment change the fire itself, and all that based on an enormous collection of fire experiments, full-scale fire experiments, conducted by the Fire Safety Research Institute. My guest today is Dr. Craig Veshing, who you may recall from a previous episode about the mission of FSRI. And today I talk with Craig about his experience in running multiple full-scale fire experiments, and especially on how the ventilation conditions in those experiments have influenced the outcomes of these fires. And this impact of ventilation includes opening doors, windows, establishing flow paths in your rooms, having stack effect, and also having wind effects and other flow phenomena that can happen if your structure is of a great volume. We also delve into the experiments with e-scooters, e-bikes as targets and as sources of fire. So if you're interested in this body, perhaps you need to listen almost to the end of the episode, but I promise it's good, it's worth it. This is as much fire science as it can be, and I really hope you will enjoy this one. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Fire Science Show.

And now, back to the episode about ventilation in fires. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm today with Craig Vesink from Fire Safety Research Institute. Hello, Craig. Great to see you. How's it going? Thanks for having me back. You're very welcome. You've invited me to a very secret stream of extremely interesting fire experiment. And if you think that secretfully inviting me to witness a fire experiment is what gets you into the show, then you're goddamn right. It actually does. But you've built my curiosity, and we're going to discuss those experiments, those recent experiments as well in the show. But I've known you for years, and I've studied your work for years, and you've been researching something that's very interesting for me, which is smoke flows and how the smoke behaves in the fire. And as a smoke control engineer, this is something very close to me, though you deal mostly with different types of structures than I do. So maybe let's start with why for so many years at your time at NIST, now at ULFSRI, what still gives you the ideas to research how flows behave in compartment settings? Where's the merit for this type of research? Certainly. I'll start by saying that the next wave of this means you have to come out and do a fire science show live with us. Oh, man. Get the full experience. I'll put the plug in for those listening to stay tuned. We're going to work on something even more fun in the near future. You know it doesn't take much of convincing me to go and burn something down. Exactly. Yeah, cool. So to answer your question, a lot of this work is driven by the fire service. We've always had a strong working relationship with the fire service. And when we say with, we mean with. I mean, we've always had technical panels. We have an advisory board made up of active, you know, and recently retired fire service professionals to make sure that the work we're doing is relevant to them. And as the fire environment continues to evolve with new construction, with, you know, new fuels, recognizing how their actions interact with that fire environment are important. So we've been doing this work, you know, going on a little over a decade now, at least for me, in terms of how do we understand what's going on. And if you look back kind of the history of, we'll say, just with FSRI's work, you know, we've been stacking kind of complexity of experiments. And so originally it was, let's just look at ventilation. As much as we can isolate ventilation from everything else, what we'll do is we'll do a series of ventilation. The first is let's ventilate on plane. So it'll be horizontal ventilation, so same plane as the fire. And how does changing those ventilation tactics change the flows within the structure? By ventilation in here, you mean like openings, doors, windows, stack effect, winds, this type of, not like... Absolutely. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so we started, you know, we started in the lab, so we didn't have wind, and we were doing single-story structures, so we didn't have stack-to-stack concerns. And so let's start simply, and then what we'll do is we'll take windows, we'll take doors, and initially the windows were all like we'll call plug windows. So we hardened them. They were things that we could repeatedly open or close at a fixed time. They were non-combustible. So it allowed us to just look at the true effect of changing openings structure. Then we got a little more complex and we said, well, now what if we vent off plane? So what if we start taking ceilings and roofs on single and multi-story structures? How does that start to change the fire behavior? And so we looked at all the different ventilation tactics when it comes to now horizontal and vertical ventilation. And we did see that as we changed that vertical ventilation component, timing became critical. We can open that vertical vent. You know, it does get a little bit of relief, so to speak, for the firefighters because you drop the pressure locally because it's going to expand and travel vertically. However, you've created a really efficient flow path. And by this, you've got, you know, mostly unidirectional exhaust through that vertical vent and then mostly unidirectional inlet through that corresponding horizontal ventilation. And so if you don't have suppression closely tied, you're going to result in larger fire growth because basically made a chimney. But if we take advantage of that initial unidirectional intake, the firefighters now have a cleaner path towards the fire. They can leverage some of that to their advantage, but that time when it was fixed can be very, very short. People would very underestimate, and I would also be within this group of people, we would underestimate the effects of the flow and ventilation on the fire on its own. You know, in our engineering, if you use design tools such as CFD simulations or zone models, you very often prescribe a very specific environment in your building in which the fire reaction is happening. And very rarely you would connect the size, how big the fire is with your ventilation, because you would go back to the concept of a design fire, which is related to occupancy, not related to ventilation conditions in that case, usually. And even if you did try to like merge them, join them a bit, you would very rarely simulate any transient changes. Perhaps you would if you simulate, let's say, a JetFun system because you have to start the system at some point. But that's your transient change. I start the system, that's it. But here, the window can break, the doors can be opened. You've used the phrase that there are actions in the fire response that changed it completely in understanding those actions. Can you give me like some sort of visual difference of really huge change in the fire dynamics or in fire behavior when the flow path has changed that justifies this type of research? Oh, absolutely. So as we move forward and image in our own experiments in terms of complexity, when we moved out of the lab, we moved into acquired structures. So in 2018, 2019, we burned some acquired homes, some single-family homes, single-story, multi-story, some garden apartments, so three-story within the closing to your stairwell, and then also in a strip mall. So we burn somewhere, I'll speak in English, units, I apologize for being in feet, you know, units that are 60, 70 feet wide by 70, 80 feet deep, so very, very large structures. And what's fascinating with all of these is each time we increase our scale, the volatility or the response kind of also increases with it, right? And it's not something we would expect differently. But when we talk about it, it is still kind of, you know, interesting. When we did our strip mall units, we were in a, we'll say, 50 by 70 square foot structure. And we had a front door open and we had eventually 64 square feet of vertical ventilation. And when we popped that vertical ventilation, so simulating the firefighter tactic of vertical ventilation, in this scenario, it was uncoordinated. So we vented just to see what would happen, independent of suppression. And we had north of 30 miles an hour and 2000 degrees Fahrenheit come down at that vertical vent. So you had the strip mall, you had the fire that was like building up, and then you suddenly start the venting action, and then the fire accelerates to this type of velocities. This is something I would not have in my assumptions. I would probably go below 8, 10 miles per hour, you know, for my inlet. I would not like to cross that boundary. And 30 is definitely way above that. Yeah, so it's, you know, it's like they're performing this tactic to aid suppression. And so we need to recognize, you know, as we design structures, what is the structure supposed to handle to as part of, there is an emergency then in addition, you know, what is the fire department going to, too, as part of it? There is an emergency then, in addition, you know, what is the fire department going to do when they arrive, especially in single-family homes where life safety is the priority. So we saw in our search and rescue study, you know, we moved away from plug windows to real glass, so we were failing windows. This was built basically like a real house. We had full HVAC systems. And now when you start taking windows, it's, hey, we're taking this window to potentially rescue an occupant. So we've got fire in a bedroom or we've got fire in a kitchen. Break those windows for entry to simulate firefighters going to search for occupants. What does that do in terms of changing the fire dynamics on the structure? So what might have been a single room fire in a bedroom, now we've got a second low pressure vent across the hallway. And if they're not isolating that room, we're driving fire across the whole of the 1600 square foot house in first flames at the window in 30 seconds and flash over in under 90, you know, that second room ignited. But this is complicated fire dynamics. And I guess what you need to process that knowledge into is, say, simple first considerations for firefighters to have some type of a decision process and perhaps also in a statistical way, you know, how often this happens or is it on average better to break a window or not? Absolutely. So, you know, when we talk about how we work with the fire service, when we're putting out outputs directed for the fire service, we meet them where they are. So we generate what we call tactical considerations. And that's the outputs that help them make decisions on the fire ground. They're not absolutes, they're recommendations, right? It's not you shall do this. You can consider this as an option as part of many tactics you might consider as part of your fire response. And so when we talk about, you know, search and rescue, and the study that's ongoing is, all right, if we're going to break a window for entry to search for an occupant, what happens when we break that window in terms of the fire response? And then what can we do as firefighters to minimize those negative outcomes? And the first one is go and isolate that door. So if there is a bedroom door in place, close it because, you know, shutting off that, you know, disconnecting that from the primary slow path, right, being you're no longer in the exhaust portion of a flow path from that high pressure fire department, that does a tremendous amount of good for either keeping conditions as they were or actually sometimes improving them, especially if you've got now this local exterior ventilation, right? You just made this vent. Take advantage of that vent. Close the door, and now your flow path is just that room, and you've got bidirectional flow at the window, your smoke layer is lifting, fresh air is coming in, and things are improving. window, your smoke layer is lifting, fresh air is coming in, and things are improving. When you don't close that door, now we've got a low-pressure exhaust in a room full with volatile fuels, and so all of those hot fire gases coming out of the original fire compartment will continue to move down towards that window, and you've got the heat, you've got the fuel, and now you've provided oxygen. And so we've shown time and time again how that time window continues to shrink, especially when that gent location is closer and closer to the fire group. So basically, the actions must be complete. Otherwise, they perhaps create an environment that's more onerous than what you had before, right? Exactly. And we started looking at our tactics and our response and the data as relative to the point of our intervention. And so as opposed to saying, oh, well, this is the total cumulative impact prior to their arrival. What we found in working with the fire services, they just want to know, hey, if I perform action A or action B, which one's going to have a net positive impact? Because there's only so much we can tell about a fire scene from the outside. And so we have to suppress the fire. We have to go in and occupy the space to determine if there are occupants, you know, their shields under a bed or behind a closed bathroom door. There's multiple instances of that occurring, you know, kind of every month here in the States, how do we provide them the best possible information to make the safest decisions? And we've been preaching this, you know, fire safety message, close before you doze for a long time now, of occupants are more likely to have a bedroom door closed. Well, then we need to make sure that our tactics reflect that, give them the confidence that, you know, if you can identify that the door is closed from the outside, whether it's opening the window instead of taking it or just visually inspecting, hey, I've got high visibility when I look in this window and I can see the door's closed, that becomes a safe point to enter and also a place of refuge because if you search beyond that room, you can re-isolate it and keep that room disconnected, you know, from the high pressure sources. That's only part of the story. Some of the challenges now with, you know, HVAC systems, right, we've got this duct network of supplies and returns in the house. So how does that impact it? And yet we see some additional flow, but not significant. Eventually the pressure balances out. And then at the same time, you know, in the states we see, you know, some HVAC systems will have supplies and returns. Some of them will have just a supply in the room and then what we call a transfer event. So they basically pass through above the door and then a common return in the hallway or a living room. And so we've now started to run all of the different scenarios to reflect all of the different types. What if the supply is high versus low? What if the return is high versus low, all those different things are now stacked to better understand the complexities of having a system. So in this case, would this go back to some design recommendations or it still is for firefighters? I don't think firefighters can attack HVC channels in the building that much. But the designer can point a cut of damper inside and perhaps create an impenetrable pathway, right? Yep. So, you know, when we talked a couple of years ago now, I think, right, for our first episode, we talked about how FSRI was evolving from Firefighter Safety Research Institute to Fire Safety Research Institute. So that's part of our larger mission is, yes, we're still at our core, you know, doing work with the fire service because at the end of the day, when fire happens, right, we're calling them to come help. But if we could do things on the prevention side, on the building code side, on the standards side, that's part of our larger mission is all of fire safety. And so we're running these experiments and then we'll publish our papers like we do in either journals, you know, open accents or self-publish, especially when it comes to the fire service to ensure that people have better information so that when these things are up for reviewing the building code and other standards, there's more data now when it comes to fire. Because oftentimes, right, fire is kind of the secondary or tertiary point in the conversation. Unless we force our way through the door to say, hey, you know, we've got fire concerns here. And, you know, we're trying to do that more and more. It's going to work out in all avenues to ensure that we have a safe public and fire service response. Okay. So you've done so many of those experiments. I love talking to you because you have seen so many fires, as controlled as possible space. I'm a designer. I have my building. I use a design fire in that building. Let's say I have a closed compartment in which I have my design fire. It starts burning. People escape. But I have this underpinning assumption that the doors to this compartment are self-closing. And what notoriously happens, in Poland at least, and I would envisage this happening all over the world, someone will block these doors because they annoy them to hell. And in Poland, they usually block them with fire extinguishers to make it more interesting. Anyway, this person has, in their mind, just blocked the door. But from perspective of what we're touching in this talk, they perhaps changed the complete flow path behavior in the building. So let's say it's a compartment at some story of a larger building. How big that changes the fire behavior or the fire itself in this compartmentalized setting. Maybe you can give me some examples. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the door plays a tremendous role. Doors are very efficient vents, being that we have no sill and pretty high soffit when it comes to, at least in the residential compartment relative to the ceiling. So they're very good at exchanging fresh air in and combustion gases out. So it facilitates a lot of fire spread. So when we've done some experiments in kind of your typical residential compartment, so like 11 by 12, 11 by 10, with windows closed, door closed, a lot of times that fire will self-extinguish. Even with an HVAC system, you might get some moldering if you've got the right ignition fuel. But once that door's open, that fire now has access to all of that air, even if the rest of the building is closed. And so what we've seen then is now that fire is getting large enough that it can either self-vent the windows in the room, which now allows you to have post-flashover fire because those windows are going to be more than enough to supply oxygen to that compartment. But we also get a lot of flame spread into the hallway. And so now we're spreading along our carpets. And our carpets are very good at spreading fuel. They're synthetic plastic materials, basically. And so we get this flame spread either down the hallway towards other bedrooms or into this larger common space. And now if you were going to make entry to the structure as part of your fire support, your suppression actions, well now you've got a fire that's meeting kind of where you are because it's traveled down that carpet and into the next room. All it needs now is that additional burst of oxygen. So these open doors facilitate a ton of flame spread. They also facilitate a ton of smoke movement. And so now, you know, when that door is closed initially, the rest of the rooms are pretty clean. I mean, you have some transport through the duct network if there's an HVAC system. But if that door is open, I mean, you'll start to see smoke. You know, the smoke layer will bank down to basically the floor of almost every room in the house. And we know that that smoke is filled with a lot of toxic gases, especially as we transition to synthetics. And now if you have anything with a battery, you know, your room might transition to post-flash. You've got a cell phone battery, a laptop battery. Who else? What else could it be, right? Like now the combination of that toxic soup is far worse. And if you do go further and further underventilated, we know that there's a direct correlation with toxicity and underventilation. So yeah, it's a compounding factor when you've less compartmentation. And that would be my common understanding from years ago that allowing the doors to be open is the main action would be letting smoke out. But I think the much harder concept to grasp is as much about letting the air in to allow the fire. And you've previously mentioned also the acceleration. To what extent this effect of acceleration is changing the fire scene? We've seen a change. You know, I first started doing this, the prevalence of, you know, sofas and chairs and beds that were constructed differently, well more common. And so we had some what we call our grandmothers, your great grandmother sofas that were, you know, might still be cotton. And you'd have, you know, 10, 15, 20 minutes, and before that, that sofa gets full involved, and the velocity of the fire coming off of it, the smoke production's far less. You know, now everything is basically, you know, polyurethane foam, polyester batting, polyester microfiber. Those things will transition and flame and produce flame heights that are much different. We've also now got a pool fire burning under the sofa as well. Two factors simultaneously. And that drops your time to about three minutes or so before that might flash over. And then what's even more difficult to comprehend when you think about the timeline we had is we recently wrapped up a series of e-scooter experiments, a small electric moped. And when those got going, you know, we went from smoke showing to peak heat release rate in about 19 seconds. Okay. And that's about 1.2 to 1.3 megawatts. And that's also with, you know, a jet flame coming out now. So if you tail your ceiling, you also come with a little bit of a pressure weight from these gases get going. So about 0.2 PSI overpressure. So you can break some windows, things like that. But if you start to fail your drywall or you're living in an environment where some of your passive fire protection is already compromised, in addition to the rest of the things igniting because you've ejected cells, you've got this flame shard, you've got a jet flame that's probably eight to ten feet hot. And so you think about velocity in that aspect, right? Like not only are we spreading fire faster, our actual outcome is a little bit of a jet fire coming off this bike. It peaks, and then while you might be able to handle that first wave from the energy dissipation, the bike itself is filled with a whole bunch of plastics and foams. And so the bike can get a second peak of another 1.2 to 1.5 megawatts. So these things store anywhere between one to three megawatts of energy in this really compact form factor. And our timeline has shrunk again. So we've got the velocity of we need to either isolate ourselves or evacuate the structure, combined with just the straight fire behavior and fire dynamics aspect of this. It's a two-fold problem. But imagine you have the same fire and you have the same fuel arrangement, and the only difference is your flow path. It exists in this way or in another way. In one, you have 10 miles per hour. In another one, you have 25 miles per hour inside of your flow path. I'd love to see to what extent this flow path is really the defining element in a potential fire. I mean, think about it just from a convective heat transfer coefficient problem, right? We go from our natural to forced ventilation. Our H is going up potentially by an order of magnitude. Even if we're keeping that delta T the same, these higher velocity flows are just transferring that much more energy. The more energy we're transferring, we're failing things faster. Right now, imagine if you're a firefighter or an occupant, and even if we kept delta T the same and we put them in the exhaust portion of the flow path, right, their inability to survive that, it skyrockets because we can't, we're transferring energy so much more efficiently. We've got these high velocity flows. So all of these things are, we're talking ambient conditions, right? Now we add wind to the equation, as you kind of alluded to earlier, and your fire can generate between a single-story, single-family residential environment, probably about five miles per hour of velocity just from fire approach. Now, we add another five to 10 miles per hour from wind engine's equation, and you've got a much more hazardous situation way quicker than you probably anticipated. Now, to move forward, I'm going to be persistent on my engineering approach. Again, I design my spaces having a design fire in mind. Another thing that actually struck me when I was watching the streams that you sent me, you had a fire in some sort of a bedroom. And it's a multi-compartment house, a corridor that connected to multiple rooms. You had a lot of cameras. And you've set a fire in a bedroom. It was like a nicely growing fire. I don't even remember. Was it armchair or was it the mattress itself? Yeah, just an armchair immediately adjacent to the mattress. So it was technically a single item that was burning. It was quite a large fire on the camera. You could see, like, tall flames. You could eventually see the smoke going into the corridor, into adjacent rooms. You could see some smoke layer going down in the corridor. That was interesting. I wouldn't say it was very dense, but you could see smoke. Now, eventually this room transitioned into a flash over. And from that point in time, it was ridiculous. Like in like, I don't know, 20, 30 seconds, the corridor was full of smoke, not a smoke layer anymore. It was literally full of smoke. And you could see this layer, literally full of smoke. And you can see this layer, dense, black layer to which you cannot see within seconds going down. So this transition, like, of course everyone knows a flashover is a brutal transition in fire dynamics. Of course every fire engineer knows that the fire after flashover and before flashover will be two different animals. That's why we distinguish them by the fact if they went through flashover and before flashover will be two different animals. That's why we distinguish them by the fact if they went through flashover or not. But damn, this was intense. Like this transition was insane. And now if I take this knowledge, this observation into my project, and let's say I'm designing an office space anywhere, and my assumption is there's a one megawatt fire in there, which perhaps would be fiddling at the flashover limit of that compartment. And a flashover happened in that compartment. All my other assumptions of this design fire, they're pretty much worthless because the fire is so much different at that point. It is something that I, as an engineer, I mean, I understood it happens, but boy, you have to witness it to really appreciate this transition. Absolutely. So what's interesting in the experiments that you've been watching, you know, we have real windows of all these structures. And so a lot of times when we see a change in literature now and some of the general communication is the ability to predict flashover. In a fixed ventilation world, we kind of have a decent idea that we can start to model that, right? We've got some feedback, all these kind of things. But in our real-world experiments, those windows start to crack and fail kind of in an unknown time. It depends on, you know, were screens in place to start or were there no screens? Were we single-pane, dual-pane windows? We've got a concurred study looking at that from the wildland exposure from the outside in. All of that stuff plays a role. And so what we think could be a well-contained fire because, hey, we've only got a partial window open or something like that, it's kind of limiting our fire growth. As soon as we've got that change in behavior in the structure, right, that's the window breaking or, say, the occupant escaping or reading the door open, the transition of flashover goes from, yeah, we've got some fire on the bed or the mattress or this chair, and it's kind of contained there for two, three, four minutes. But from window break to flash over then, right, we see probably within the next 15 to 20 seconds that take off. And it's hard to describe when you try to model that or design curves. Oh, yeah, our heat release rate is going to go from maybe a couple hundred kilowatts to a couple megawatts in 15 seconds. You're like, no way, that's not possible. That's, that doesn't seem right. Why would we, why would, you know, we, we have that, that historic fire growth curve, right? It's this nice, clean, parabolic shape. And we've simplified it down to that. We see that in all the textbooks, especially when we first teach where an underventilated fire is in compartment fire dynamics. And that, that's all with this fixed ventilation kind of profile. But when we go under-ventilated prior to flashover, now we've got this change in ventilation. You know, this ventilation-induced flashover is much more volatile. And it happens, you know, we see it in the bedroom really quickly. You know, we flashover somewhere around five to five and a half minutes. But it's that last 30 seconds that really takes off. I think you also saw a kitchen experiment. So now we've gone from an 11 by 14 room to something that's probably, you know, 20, 40 by 30. It's an open floor clean kitchen living room. And so we ignite with a small pan of canola oil, basically to simulate an unintended cooking fire. We let that reach its auto-ignition temperature. So now we've got this kind of oil burning on a pan. And we've got some adjacent bags of chips and paper towels. And we've got a full kitchen, so cabinets and everything. But we're on the lean side when it comes to fuel in that kitchen. I mean, we've got some cups in the cabinets and stuff. But a typical kitchen might have a lot more fuel in the cabinets and things like that. And what's interesting there is, you know, the timeline, it follows a similar ish timeline, right? We've got this slow growth for a long time, especially getting those wood fuels going versus some of the polyurethane in our bedroom. But we've got it contained to the kitchen probably 10 minutes after oil ignition, 12 minutes after oil ignition. We've got some flames that begin to roll the ceiling, but it's still kind of a kitchen fire. I mean, we've set off the smoke launch probably within 30 seconds of that oil going to ignition. And then we're still kind of a kitchen fire for quite some time. And then it goes from kitchen to living room to post-flashover. That final minute again is, hey, we've either failed the kitchen window or the top pane of one of the living room windows cracked and started to fail. And now we've got a little more ventilation. And then we're off to the races. And that part is predictable once we see that glass fail. But the time to glass failures is not necessarily that repeatable. So that's the challenge when you're looking at your design curve is, okay, well, when is this going? When is this next piece, this next domino going to fall in this scenario? Because that's what we have to plan for is the unintended ventilation on the ground. Because that's going to happen at some point down the line is something else is going to fail in the system. I think you're touching on something very important in here for designers, because here we literally touch the boundaries of to what extent the design fire approach is even usable. And as soon as some of those triggers are broken, the design is no longer usable. Because if the size of the fire depends on the fact if the glass breaks or not, and if it happens in 17th or 19th minute on which we have no power over and i also think in a design space perhaps underestimate the threats of very quickly developing fires because if the fire can develop in two three minutes in a confined space and reach a flashover state at which it fills a corridor with smoke within literally 30 seconds. If this happens in a large floor of a complicated building, and I often would go to office as an example, if you put that on the timeline of a building, how long does it take to detect? How long does it take for a fire alarm to pass? Because it's not just sensor detecting. It has to go through a control panel. There is a person that perhaps can be obligated to verify the fire or not. It is automated, but not immediately. It's not like the second you detect, the second people know. It takes time, sometimes minutes. If your timeline shrinks to minutes and you have to add the uncertainty of the egress process on top of that, decision-making, the movement itself. You suddenly enter quite a dangerous timeline because in your design fire scenario, when it is medium growth and you can keep it like that for a few minutes and then it slowly spreads the smoke, the fire doesn't spread, you perhaps are okay. spread you perhaps are okay but if in a scenario where your armature is put against a cabinet with paper and you have some loose paper on your on your desk and perhaps the window is slightly opened fire dynamics of that compartment will be completely different than than the ones you could assume and and this really scares the hell out of them yeah and and so the the the complement to that right is so we've got on the design side and recognizing all these challenges. And at the same time, that's why we do so much work with the fire service is so that they can recognize if they're going to create a ventilation opening as part of their suppression or search and rescue operations, what are the consequences of said action? And so if we've got two points to open, one near the fire, one far from the fire, recognizing that distance is buying them time for a negative, a potential negative outcome, right? If we can vent further, that allows us to get into that room to isolate it first, you know, because we might not be able to search past that living room kitchen that's on fire, right? If the rescue operations are getting there before the suppression, well, how do we get to those rooms? Well, we've got to get from the outside in. So the front door may no longer be the natural point of entry. And so if we choose an alternative point of entry, recognizing what the consequences of that is, and if we break those windows and don't isolate, we're going to bring the fire down the hole towards that ventilation. There's more than enough fuel in any residential structure these days to facilitate that flame spread. And so we have consciously been working with the fire service for the last decade to kind of put all these pieces together, whether it's the suppression actions timing with ventilations, ventilation timing with surge, surge timing with suppression, so that all of these things can be independently recognized, but then also recognizes how the system operates together. And now let's put some variability on that with external conditions. I remember before you said the building on fire, you said that these are good conditions, let's burn it now. We have very low wind. So I assume in your long career, you've perhaps witnessed a lot of wind-driven fires in buildings. And I've read your papers with Dan about wind-driven fires. So now, let's say we've done everything correct in your building design or the decisions are correct, but there's this external factor. How does that play in the grand equation of the fire in the compartment? As an experimentalist, there's times when I absolutely hate wind because it has, you know, it's like, well, we want to make sure that, you know, if we're lighting this particular room on fire, we've got wind blowing into that potential vent, then it's going to change our entire experiment. We're counting on that vent being a low-pressure exhaust. You know, wind will completely reroute those fire gases within the compartment. So what would be a natural bidirectional flow and potentially unidirectional exhaust, heading up where other vents might be open, the wind can turn that to unidirectional in. And that becomes a huge concern for us because it's a different scenario. Put that into the real world now, and, world now and firefighters might be breaking that window and they put firefighters in now what they thought would be the intake portion of the flow path and it's in the exhaust portion of the flow path. And we talked earlier about velocity, right? Now they're exposed to much higher convective heat flux, which is really, really bad for them in the environment. We were doing an experiment a few months ago now, and we had a living room fire with an open floor plan kitchen living room, and we had two windows on the kitchen side and two windows on the living room side, so they're kind of connected, but open floor plan. And right inside the front door, which connected to the living room, we had an e-scooter, so that moped e-bike. And we lit the sofa on fire, and the fire started to spread. And we got flashed over in our living room, eventually our kitchen, because of the vents. But we had about 10 to 12 mile per hour wind coming from the kitchen side. So the living room side now becomes the low-pressure exhaust, and the kitchen's a high pressure supply. So we basically had unidirectional in on our kitchen windows. And when we ignited, eventually ignited this e-bike, we didn't even know we did it visually. You know, our instrumentation told us, hey, this thing probably failed because the cell temperatures got up to a critical value. We had so much fire coming out of our vents at such magnitude that we didn't know we set an e-bike on fire. And so that's what wind can do. You know, we had quite the wind-driven fire. And I mean, suppression became, okay, well, then we'll attack from that side and put water in that window and knock the whole thing down. In that regard, you know, we took advantage of the wind. But at the same time, like that definitely changed our entire experiment. And fortunately for us, you know, it's an experiment, but now imagine that being someone's house or someone's building and you take that wind side vent and it's going to be much harder to fire to control, especially if you can't get suppression where it needs to be. So it plays a huge role. And then at times it can play a much, much less noticeable aspect. So we were doing some in our search and rescue houses, and we had a slight wind, probably a couple miles per hour. And so you couldn't necessarily see it visually in the windows. So, like, I mean, there's still enough pressure in the structure that we're having some exhaust, you know, come out early in fire group before that room kind of reached flashover. The wind played a role where we had much more fire in our hallway than we expected. Okay. So while it didn't necessarily meet the true conditions of a wind-driven fire in the sense that we had this well-defined change in gas flows within our flow path, it was subtle enough that those gases that would normally have flown out the window because that was the nearest vent to our ignition, you know, a lot of the, it kept enough pressure at that window such that we had a lot more fire in the hallway. So when the firefighters came down to suppress the fire, you know, they turned the corner and the entire hallway flashed over. And they're like, what happened? Why isn't this different than every other fire we had? And so while, you know, as experimenters, we obviously instrument the whole structure, but we also have wind sensors and weather stations up, so we could actually see the wind change to the point where we had several mile-an-hour gusts, and the gusts were enough. You don't notice it in the time because of the microscopic impact on the macroscopic problem. It was enough so that we started to bring to our subfloor and things in the hallway we were you know damaging some of the other doors because you know the door directly across the fire department was closed but we actually started to burn it through because we had so much more of a thermal insult in that hallway and so when you when we watch the videos back you know we have this good one that we need to release at some point. Side by side from the exterior, you have no idea the difference. And then we have the helmet cams and the interior cams, you know, for the suppression crew. They turn, you're like, these are drastically different fires inside. And so not only is it a problem for designers, right, in the fire protection community, but also for the responding firefighters is they might not know that that size up from the exterior tells them a lot, but it doesn't tell them everything. And that was one of the more fascinating ones was that subtle. So we lined up, you know, here's our wind and then here's our heat flux in the floor, in the hallway. And you can start to see, oh yeah, this is why these two things are different. And then once it got going, the wind died down a little bit, but also there was enough fire in this interior hallway that the wind was no longer going to impact. It was just spreading down the hall towards the other bedrooms and also towards our kitchen and living room. So we had a much different fire for one of the unknown exterior factors. I wouldn't say that designers are taking that into account. I think we would usually consider our buildings somehow safe from wind, especially if we talk about modern tall buildings. But then again, there's this change in how buildings are being designed today because today you score additional points for having actually natural openings in your building. So if you want to have very high EAM or LEED certificate for your building, you may actually have some sort of natural openings in your building, which can be randomly opened by the people inside your office. And what you've said here, you probably won't have significant flow paths, suddenly a stream, a jet stream of air in your, you might if the wind is strong enough. But this little nudging of the fire towards like one direction or another can cause a very interesting outcome. You've also mentioned something that captured my attention. You said that you had a scooter. You were not actually setting the scooter on fire. It was just there. And as I understood from my interview with Adam Barovi, UL does a lot of these tests where the lithium ion batteries or electronical devices would just be present in the fire to just see what happens to the fire scene by their presence. So not necessarily it serving as the trigger for the fire or the first item ignited, but just being there. So what are your experiences so far with these types of devices? To what extent it changes the outcomes? That's an interesting question. I've only done a few, so not relative to everything else that we've set on fire, at least me personally. I've only done a handful where the battery's been kind of the victim and not initiator. And for one, you know, we had our wind-driven incident. and for one you know we had our wind-driven incident it it struck me so odd because came in we looked like we would normally for any kind of fire patterns on the wall or the floor or anything that would indicate that hey this this ignited differently than than everything else or there's a pre-flashover pattern things like that and there was nothing i granted the wind-driven case you know obviously magnifies all of that and so we're hopeful the next time we get to completely destroy a building that we can do it again because that was one of those ones where we learned a lot from the wind-driven case, but we really wish it wasn't a wind-driven experiment. But we were locked in a timeline, so you kind of have to go for it sometimes. When we've gone to some of the smaller batteries, it always depends. A lot of our experiments, we tend to go to a post-flashover state. And so you don't necessarily see a lot of the impact because that fire is just overwhelming some of these things. But other colleagues have done more. So it's kind of out of my scope a little bit in terms of what I'm usually setting on fire, at least the fire sizes I've been dealing with recently. And batteries as the first item ignited, as you saw, any experiences with that in residential settings? Yeah, so I've done probably now six or eight e-scooter experiments where we've initiated failure of the battery packs there. And what's fascinating to me is, you know, initially I thought it was going to be more repeatable. I thought, you know, we're going to fail this, whether it's an overcharge. So we removed the BMS from the equation and we're going to send it, you know, some current and voltage to allow this battery pack to go to thermal only. One, the timing is so wide. As a terminalist, it's very frustrating when you're like three and a half hours into overcharging this thing and you're still not getting ignition but the failure mode is what was kind of fascinating to me is that sometimes we would get this kind of the definition of an explosion is kind of always one of those which definition we're going to choose but this over pressure event where we actually you know broke some windows and doors where we had this kind of more uniform type, you know, fire behavior. And then there's times where we get this jet flame. Okay. And it just shoots a flame 8, 10, 12 feet straight up or straight out the side. And when it's straight up, it's not as hazardous, at least in my opinion, because you're going up to drywall ceilings and stuff and it pulls the ceiling but the fuel isn't there when we failed it and shot it sideways you know we shot it straight into a couch okay and so that was like okay well this is bad and then we did some overheating experiments as well so we just took like a pipe heater or bucket heater and slapped it right on the side of the cells and overheated it that way and sometimes we got this explosive type behavior and sometimes we got this jet flame. So that was kind of interesting when we started to look at that in terms of, well, how predictable really is this? Our time windows were all over the place as short as 30 minutes or even less in a couple of overheating experiments to four and a half hours. And so when we talk about design aspects, right, is how do you control for that such large variability? Is the bike damaged? Is it brand new? What's the charging? What all happened that's kind of a little bit of a black box at the moment, you know, in terms of the fire protection community? And so the type of hazard and the failure mechanism was all over the place in terms of then what it did to the rest of the structure. I mean, we broke some walls, we broke some windows, we broke drawers. And then we did run some experiments with the sprinkler system that had some very encouraging, very positive results. And so we're currently writing that up for both the fire spread side and the toxicity side. So hopefully we should have that paper done by the end of the year to share with everyone in terms of what that looks like with a residential 13D system and some of these electric vehicles inside. So we're electric scooters, right? The e-mobility type stuff. That's exciting. I'm not yet ready to share it because there's still some stuff we need to analyze from the inside. Craig, to close the episode, I think the theme of the episode could be the variability of fires. You've seen, my guess would be, more than a few hundred fires in your life. Do they still surprise you? How is it in the eyes of someone who burns so much? Absolutely. Burn days are the best days. What's difficult these days is as you get older, the rehab days, the instrumentation days, you feel a little bit more each time. But it's still fascinating. I mean, the environment continues to change. We're continuing to push boundaries. I mean, when we did our strip model experiments, those still strike me as some of the most exciting experiments we've ever done, at least me personally. I mean, when we had a double-wide unit that was like about 70 by 80, or maybe even 80 by a little bit larger, we were using like group A plastic commodity boxes, so 125 polystyrene cups and cardboard boxes. We had them stacked, I think, four high, and five polystyrene cups and cardboard boxes. We had them stacked, I think, four high, and I treated them almost like aisles, like you would see in a typical strip mall-type occupancy. And we ignited in the far corner from the open front door. And we started to get fire spread across these boxes, and so we went from kind of one group to the next group. So we had a little bit of a, depending on your definition, I might, you know, some of the audience might not agree with a traveling fire, so to speak, but we had this flame front moving, and we had temperatures, you know, in these localized areas that were, you know, floor to ceiling 1100 degrees Celsius. So whether you call that, you know, a flashover or not, I had a good conversation with Guillermo recently about that, but we had this flame front move across and what was so wild to me is that we put, we basically had a unidirectional exhaust blow at this front door this entire time. So smoke was shooting out like a jet 75 feet from the front door while the door was unidirectional exhaust as this fire was building because with the open floor plan strip mall unit, there's more than enough oxygen to support this fire before it actually started to become truly underventilated. So the flame front moves to the front door. And as soon as they get to the front door, the exhaust stops or we get a nice bidirectional flow. And it looks like anything you'd ever seen before. So this, you know, if your, if your fire department's arriving three, four, five minutes afterwards, they can arrive as we've got this unidirectional smoke coming out, thinking that we've got a smoke explosion going on or some other effect when it's really just fire dynamics in this large volume. Could combine with a very specific fuel that you had because that's a very, let's say, dangerous type of commodity that you had. Exactly. There's a really fascinating case in New York, and I think it's in Troy, New York, the Alpha Lane bowling alley. If you ever get a chance to look up that video, a ton of smoke coming out of the bowling alley. And then all of a sudden it ignites off as a unidirectional exhaust, basically all self-driven. And we've seen these kind of things happen more and more recently with these larger volume structures and these highly volatile fuels. And they're fire dynamics driven, not necessarily we're taking windows, changing the ventilation pattern, things like that. It's purely, hey, we've got this large volume that can support this large fire growth. So we're going to be doing some townhouse fires in the next few years. Looking at now, what does it look like when you have three stories stacked with an open stairwell? Can you replicate some of this behavior in a residential fire ground ground we saw it somewhat in some of our fire investigation work where we had a kind of a two-story great room where we could get this unidirectional exhaust out the front door and so that's still one of those fire dynamics things it's fascinating to me that that's still kind of you know i'm very interested to continue to see and then as we go to this building to building fire spread stuff, you know, looking at the different glass types, whether we, you know, the ordering of the panes and how that works and how the different gases between the panes all play a role. But we get the best glass in the world. But if we don't have the proper frames, we don't have the proper side, you know, it's this fire protection system that is still so fascinating to me and how all of these pieces and how we can identify some of these things by looking at the full scale. You know, we've done a lot of small scale stuff. We have a materials database now with over 70 materials for their ignition properties. And, you know, we're going to be adding their kinetics now. We've got thermal conductivity and density and all that stuff. That's wonderful for a fire modeling perspective, right? How can we start to improve our baseline capabilities? But sometimes you don't necessarily see all of the challenges until you burn it to full scale and see, oh, wow, here's this big flaw in the system that we didn't consider because all these systems are developed by people with different expertise. And once one put together, it's kind of like, oh, I didn't think about that one. So for me, that part never gets old. And it's still fun setting big things on fire. And I hope with your research, we will have less and less moments of, oh, we didn't think about that. I hope we eventually will have that as a very rare occurrence. That would be a nice world. Craig, there's a lot of resources from your group where people should seek them. Because we've, okay, people, we've talked about some interesting fire experiments, interesting fire dynamics, flow paths and everything. It's sometimes very difficult to imagine that and understand. But there are videos, there's materials, there are online courses produced by FSRI that you can go and see in details, slow-paced, what actually happened and what's the learning from that particular fire. And where should people go to find those? So the first are LMS, so the Fire Safety Academy. That's our free online training. And that's at training.fsri.org. And the latest course we just put out is on this search and rescue study. So we had run 21 experiments a couple of years ago. What we're doing is kind of running 10 more to fill in some gap. But the course is really cool because we've incorporated a lot, a lot of our video, a lot of the data kind of in a very interactive way that we haven't done before. And we also have a lot of our tech panel members as part of the course. So you can hear from the firefighters that are responding to these scenarios, what they feel, how they interpret our results. So training.fsri.org. And then on the other scale of things, a plug for our materials database, materials.fstride.org has a wealth of information about how all of these materials burn at the small scale to medium scale. So everything from an MCC to a colon. And then soon we'll be adding a lot of our full-scale data as well. So that's going to be a home for lots of material properties. When we think about why this cabinet earth earns different than that chair or that sofa, we can look at those material properties now and see first class what that looks like. All in open access. Yes, everything's free. Everything's absolutely free and open source. So the database is cool because we have the front end that you guys can interact with, with interactive graphs and tables. But then all of the data is available on GitHub. So you can go to the ULFSRite GitHub and see a handful of experimental data sets that are open, including the materials database. Fantastic. Craig, that was a pleasure as usual. And I hope to have you here again, this time perhaps talking about your super secret project with not touched at all in years. Absolutely. Anytime. I'm always happy to chat. And like we said at the start of the call, next time you've got to come to our house and do one of these last. I'll try to do that. That's fantastic. And that's it. Thank you for listening. I must tell you, we were a little stressed with Craig to describing fire experiments when you only have voice and you have no visual component is sometimes a challenge. But as I listen to this, I hope we've done a good job providing you a voice illustration of what changing the flow paths and flows in buildings cause to the fires. what changing the flow paths and flows in buildings caused to the fires. And the impact is immense, especially when Craig mentioned this, some would say, non-important impact of slow wind. That was literally just nudging the fire towards one opening versus another, but that was enough to change the complete fire physics in the compartment. So, well, this impact may be considerable. If you would like some visual cues, Craig just listed a lot of interesting resources provided by FSRI, and this includes a lot of videos from their experiments as well. So, you probably would like to check that out, because that database is literally goldmine for any fire safety engineer. So, I absolutely recommend you checking out these resources. And for today's talk, yeah, that would be it. Thank you very much for being here with me this Wednesday. And the next Wednesday, I see you here once again. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
