 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. When I started this podcast, I've made it a part of my mission to build a bridge between the firefighters and fire engineers. And when I heard that my friend Shimon, who you may remember from episode 51, is organizing a very nice workshop for fire instructors, and he actually brought to Poland some legends of this field, Sean Raphael and CFBT Roy. I thought I have to grab my microphone, drive 400 kilometers and interview these guys on what they're up to. I hope to learn about the training itself and how is it built and what they're doing. But I've got much more from this discussion. I've received three independent success stories, one coming from Sweden, where Roy tells me about how this new approach into training was developed and how it led to amazing improvements in decrease of firefighter deaths on duty. Sean told me about how this was introduced in Australia and how he developed a framework, Be Safe, that he used to read fires and how this became the skeleton of a new curriculum that was taught to new instructors. And Shimon told me how for 10 years he'd been implementing this in Poland. These three stories converge not just on fire science and understanding how they read fires, but also on the soft character traits that you would expect from a fire instructor or from a firefighter. How to take immediate decisions based on limited knowledge that you have. How to obtain knowledge. How to not be afraid of making mistakes and just fixing them, how to implement critical thinking, a lot of uncommon ideas to teaching quite uncommon people, the firefighting instructors. I hope everyone can get a lot from this talk, both from understanding the world of firefighting a bit better, but also on how to actually spread the knowledge in such a complex, multifaceted discipline as fire science is. I think these guys had found some really neat ways how to spread this knowledge in a way that people understand it. So yeah, it was absolutely worth to try 400 kilometers for that. So let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojcie's leading fire risk consultancy.

Welcome to the Fire Science Show. Today, we have some sort of discussion panel, I guess, because I'm joined here by three gentlemen who came to Poland to teach fire safety instructors, firefighters, on how to act in fires. I'm joined by Mr. Sean Raffel. Nice to meet you, sir. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. Fantastic. CFBT Roy. Hi, nice to be here. Fantastic. CFBT Roy. Hi. Nice to be here. Yeah, we're going to have to figure out what CFBT means in just a second. And my good friend, Szymon Kokan. Hi, Szymon. Hi, Wojciech. Pleasure to be here again and to be joined with my friends as well. Thanks. Thanks for bringing those nice people to Poland. And as I understand, you are here to train our Polish instructors who will then pick up the torch and teach firefighters in Poland how to act in fires. I see opportunity in here that fire engineers don't really know what you guys are up to. Like we are using as fire engineers, if I can be the voice of fire engineering here, we are using these big words, we design systems for firefighters, we design buildings to assist firefighters. I recently gave a webinar in one country where they told me explicitly they do design systems only for firefighters. The question is do we really do that? And then we really lack, you know, seeking the voice of the other side as engineers. So I'm grateful for you taking the invite to do this recording. And let's see, what do you teach? What do you look for? So, Sean, like, what's your up to? Okay, so this is my third time, I think, in Poland. The first time was about 10 years ago when Shimon invited me over. And we had some very detailed discussions about the new direction in fire training, which was compartment fire behavior training, as opposed to the old way of alighting really big fires and pushing people in there to make them tough and learn what heat feels like. So you added building to the equation, not just fire as a fire itself, but fire in a setting, which is the building, the compartment. So we say compartment fire behavior training. So compartment can mean in a room, in a large structure. It could be in an aircraft. It could be in a marine environment. So it's generally the principles of how fire develops and behaves in modern compartments and understanding that. Yeah, cool. Roy, I know a lot of that comes from Sweden, and that Sweden was some sort of one of the first places where it started. Yes, so the term CFPT actually comes from the UK. Okay. But that became a thing after UK. Actually, I think it was, if I'm not mistaken, it was John Taylor. John Taylor was one of the pioneers. Yes, certainly. He wrote I think four articles in the IFE journal. I think it was around 1994 and they really sparked my interest and created my connections into Sweden. It's a whole story. I mean, I don't talk just about the story. That's about like two hours, you know. So I'm trying to summarize this in a few seconds. So we have two fires in Sweden where we have then casualties. Okay. And there are these two guys who are then the old-style fire engineers, fire officers. That's Mats Rosander and Kristi Giselsson. So they look into this and they say, we have to study this, what happened. Because, you know, we were talking in terms that some people even today talked about, like, oh, it was like some unexpected event, you know. And I just said, no, no, no, no, there is something here. They realized, well, smoke contains fuel. Okay. I would like to say it like that, because not all smoke is fuel, but smoke contains fuel. So it's actually going to ignite. That's one thing. And ventilation has an impact, of course. And then we have the third factor, which was the time to reaching flashover. There was nothing there that wasn't being said. I think you can go 100 years before that or even more. And ventilation had an impact. That was being said by... 1920s or something, yeah. It was even before then, I think. James Bradford, 1886. Exactly. But it's like the fire risk has this tendency to forget. And we don't like that other people find out stuff. You have to find this out by yourself. So these guys then, they start training people. And yeah, well, maybe the use of terminology at the time was not scientifically based, but they were telling a story of that. So this happens, the fire develops this way. And suddenly for everyone there in Sweden, it made sense. They can understand, you can predict, because if you understand what needs to, for a backdrop to happen, for a flash off to happen, then you say, well, I can do this, I can do this. Together with that, Max and Christopher, especially Max, can develop the technique called gas cooling technique, which is to deal with the gases, not create an overpressure with steam, and to allow you to enter the corridor, walk through the corridor in a safe way, and then actually reach the fire, instead of just, as he was saying at the time, what he was taught. And he was even in Toronto and he was in L.A. And what he was being taught there was like, you know, you crawl, you don't put water in the smoke. And that dramatically changed then the safety because now you have knowledge. So instead of being reactive, you can be proactive. Krista is a really amazing character. He looked at what was happening today in his time, in mid-1970s, and the world was changing at that time because we were going from natural products, which have between 15 and 18 megajoules per kilogram, into plastics proliferating through our built environment, which is between 35 and 45 megajoules per kilogram, and they're noticing a different fire behavior. And Krista was a really amazing fellow because he said, right, the current textbook is not matching the current environment. We need to do something. So basically, he rewrote the textbook. He went back, did extensive research, did hundreds of burns in acquired structures in older villages. And he really rewrote the entire procedures, I think, for firefighting based on the modern built environment. But it wasn't actually appreciated by the management at the time. It took several years. The generation he trained several years later were in a position of authority, and they were the ones that sort of put it into the common use. You call it fire behavior, and you told me, like, you don't use the term fire science. You use the term fire behavior. Fire dynamics. Fire dynamics. Okay, sorry. Yeah, fire dynamics. I wonder, was there any connection to the fire science of that time, like Philip Thomas, Howard Morgan, James Quintieri? Yeah, so what they did then, they described fire behavior in a way. It was based on science as much as they could, but the terminology maybe was not the best. They used actually, for a backdrop, it was called something like delayed flashover. Everything was based on flashover and the limits of flammability. So to make the story then continue, what happens then is that Sweden, then in 86 after the Armenia earthquake, established the four colleges. So we have four national colleges in Sweden, and then all the education that was being done was implemented. It was a good balance. Well, the rule in Sweden is like it it's a 50 theory and it's 50 practical okay you have to understand what you're doing and you have chosen to feel it like to yeah more than feeling i was rehearsed and you know you don't want just academics there nothing wrong with that but you don't want just people good at practice but not understanding the problem so you need to combine so then then what happens then? Suddenly Sweden as the only country in the world, I think, that can say that. I'm not quite sure about that, but I think that for 26 years there hasn't been any death on a firefighter due to fire. Okay. It's not fire related. And then everyone else knows what's going on. So that's when John Taylor then decides to come to Sweden. At that point, the training was already something that every firefighter in Sweden went. It was like widespread. It was a national curriculum. Which year was that? 86. 86 is when the colleges were established. And what happened then was, so John Taylor comes. He goes to the northern college, which is in Sando, in an island by itself, and he does, you know, he talks to people, they do some burns, they do some burns, and it's like, the Swiss are doing it. What's going on? What's going on here? Because there was never been an intention from Sweden, like, we're going to export this as a product, you know, we're just doing our stuff, we want to protect... And we're talking 86. That's about the time Drysdale puts his first book on compartment fire dynamics. I think 83, I think. That's even before the first S&P handbook. We're talking about the golden era in NIST in the U.S. in fire research. Yeah. But it's hardcore research. It's not necessarily reaching the fire departments, right? Krista's research was done on a very slim budget. They had 100 houses to burn. Okay. So apparently it was a big textile industry in Sweden before the Chinese invented rayon and synthetic fabrics, and so they had a lot of buildings, villages that were basically empty. And so there was a dedicated group of people, Mats Rosander, Marcos Domingos, another one, that really had a lot of respect for Christa. He was a very hard man, but he was, you know, what you says, what you got. So he did a lot of that research. And the Swedes are very modest. They don't go around saying, oh, look at us, you know, we're doing something special. And John Taylor actually went over there on a scholarship, I think it was 94. I think it was 94, I think it was Road Grass Rescue. The English, they came there in the 90s. Okay. So this is well established in Sweden then by then. Okay, okay. Yeah. So John was one of the ones that wrote articles for the IFE, and that's what really put me on the map. That's what got me inspired to find out. Another time you were in Australia? Yes, so I joined in 83. Okay. in Australia? Yes, so I joined in 83 and our training back in 83 for fire behaviour consisted of six weeks of dragging dry hose and doing hose and coupling drills, another six weeks of doing hose and coupling drills with breathing apparatus and water and then a visit to the Ampol Refinery where we would fire a range of petrochemical fires. That was our fire behaviour training, so virtually we had nothing. Roy, fast forward to 2023 in Poland. You are here with Szymon. Szymon's organizing the training for the Polish guys. So Szymon, a question to you. This, I guess, is available online. I know there are courses. Sean has a course. I know there are materials, you wrote a book for Polish firefight, why are you here today burning a fire in a container, taking your 10 best guys through that container and then sending them to Poland to train, don't we know that already? Okay, so just a comment that I wanted to make before is firefighting is a very practical job, but you are in an environment that is governed by a lot of scientific knowledge. Basically, the laws of physics, they rule the Philippines, in the US, it doesn't matter. From the great minds that have been creating this over hundreds of years, like Faraday, we were mentioning the candle experiments or demonstrations. You can explain a lot of things just by burning a candle inside a classroom in a very safe manner. And before mentioned, James Braidwood had a rule that he followed. He didn't only want to make people understand what they have to do, but how, and most importantly, why. We're here talking 19th century Edinburgh. Yes, yes. Yeah, the origins of the first professional fire brigade in Edinburgh. And in the late 90s, a lot of Polish people also visited Sweden. Okay. But the thing was that what I was able to understand i entered the fire service in 1999 i was a cadet student until 2004 like 27 yeah i know you know they say smoke preserves you know anyway so i went to the training center and i followed whatever i saw and i didn't question it you know there was a lot of stupid stuff that we did, unhealthy, unsafe. And it was all because whenever the guys went, they saw some model and they wanted to imitate that, but they were not trained in the pedagogics. Okay. Pedagogics, yeah. So what are we actually delivering here? So they just copied a broken telephone game. So 2010, the era of social media, I'm watching all the guys travel everywhere. The Legends, Shan already co-authored 3D Firefighting with John McDonough, Ed Hartin. another chap from Australia, Ed Hartin, a guy from the United States, and Paul Grimwood, a guy from obviously UK. And it became a great read for a lot of people because it was finally something that was available in English and from the different countries that speak English. So it already made an impression that it's something quite universal. And it was because it translated a lot of what people needed to understand about the fire into the probably, let's say, most popular language. And that was 11 years ago. And they said, yeah, we can come next year. That's 10 years ago. So first, John and Shan came 10 years ago. And then now they're here again. John is currently in Warsaw. We're doing a conference next week. That's the beginning of October that we're recording this. And they showed us their way of doing things, which they learned in Sweden. And they not only learned, but they understood the model. They enhanced the model to their own needs. And then they continued to deliver it with great success. Let us jump into the model. Let us jump into the exercises. And another reason I've invited you here, because you represent the people who inspire instructors. Instructors inspire firefighters. Firefighters battle fires. So if I understand your mindset, there's a good chance I understand how you wish to shape the firefighters on all levels. I really would love, like, if I had to define myself as a scientist, I would love to say about myself that I'm specializing in compartment fires. The fire dynamics is something very close to me. And you also touch fire dynamics in a very different way. And I'm fascinated by the way that you discover it and, in a way, how similar and how different at the same time it is from the way how me and other fire researchers who do the academic side of fire do that. We come from different backgrounds, you know. You guys come from firefight training. You touched this on the ground. You've been burned. You know how it smells. We've been doing combustion mechanical engineering, civil engineering, we know how building works. We know it from different sides, it all merges, you know, in the flames. So I would love to know how such a training is planned and how actually you try to teach people this compartment of fire behavior. So there's some interesting points you raised, and I've got to mention Professor Stefan Svensson, because he was one of the guys that started the IFIW 2008. So we had this crazy idea about bringing together scientists and fire instructors, so we could get in the same room and talk about the same stuff and try to build a bridge between the you know like it's not a silo but it was somewhat siloed of course we are separated you know like we're connected by fire but everything else differs us in a way different objectives it's not a perfect environment to to share the experiences however i i know a lot of people i know a lot of fire engineers. I had in my podcast David Stacy, he's a fire engineer for USA, who's a volunteer firefighter, and he just says, I love to walk into the fire station and talk to the guys. And they usually pick up the discussion and they love it, you know. I had Professor Albert Simone, who used to be a volunteer firefighter. That's a shared story. There are many of those academics with some firefighting background. It's just you cannot take it for granted. Not every fire engineer has a background on that. Stefan's an example of that. He's also a volunteer firefighter, which he's wanted for a long time. So he's got his leg in both camps, so to speak. But he said something interesting to me years ago, and I said, Stefan, how dumb are firefighters? You know, we know nothing about fire behavior, and we've been fighting fires, and, you know, whereas electricians, they go back and they learn about electricity, and then they start wiring up houses. Well, we just start wiring up houses. You know, we start just going to fires. He said, well, don't be too hard on yourself. He said, because the first textbook about fire dynamics from a structural fire environment, not an industrial environment, was 1983, Dougal Drysdale. And I said, that's not right. It goes back to Faraday. He says, that was industrial combustion. They're trying to work out how to make combustion more efficient for industrial purposes. It wasn't until Dougal Drysdale, 83, was the first one who said, hmm, let's have a look at what's happening in a typical structure fire. So really, it's almost a new science for firefighting. The foundation was built on history of, well, let's see if this works and what doesn't. Where professional firefighting has already been going for 100 years at least. Yeah, but without that foundational scientific knowledge that other professions had. So how do we do it? So we follow in the model of Krista, really. He was a brilliant man, a very clever man. So I cannot confirm this. I've been told this by my mentor. No, it's true. My mentor was a direct student of Krista. So, there is this thing about where is the line between being a genius and a madman. Okay. That's a very thin line there. Okay. So, there is this story. So, Krista has this appearance, you know, he will come in, you know, he will come with like half of the shirt outside with half of the belly, you know. It was like, the students were like, what's going on here? You know, they look like, you know, like either that the proper officer, you know, we were visiting today, or the professor, you know, he's looking like this is the mechanic just came from having a beer or something. So here's the thing. He found out that he needed to wash his clothes. Okay. And he's using some both electricity to do that at home and time, et cetera. And he found out like, well, I can put all clothes in this wash. He will put it in a plastic bag that like the garbage, the black ones and the thick ones. He will then put the water in and he will put the washing, and he will just tape that, and he will put that in the trunk of his car. As he's driving, the clothes are washing. That's crazy. But as much as that is like a funny, you know, to tell, we use today, we call it the aquarium. I don't know what you call it. The bang bongs, the whatever it is called, which is basically, it looks like an aquarium. If you put gas in, you can show plumbability range, and you can show a lot of the stuff there. That's a decent invention, you know. Another funny story about, Krista, there's a beautiful video. I think I've got a copy of it somewhere. It's very old. And he's up the front. He's in the classroom environment. He's got a shirt on and he's got a tie on. And he's got a Bunsen burner there and he's showing the combustibility of steel wool. And he wants to stick the wool up and his tie catches fire. So he gets a pair of scissors and he cuts the end off the tie. And he's bending over again and his tie catches fire again. So he reaches out and he cuts it. So by the time he finishes his presentation, his tie is about half as long as it was originally. But he never was to beat. He just carried on like nothing had ever happened. I wonder where did he have the scissors. So just let me tell you one more thing, because I understood from these guys mainly, and I appreciated that he came up with some of the original concepts that are being used over decades to teach firefighters about basic yet fundamental principles of firefighting, like flammability range. I made sure because I was responsible for it in Poland that it is properly called in the Polish CVT curriculum signed by the National Fire Chief that you are supposed to give students a demonstration of flammability range using Gieselsons Aquarium. So that's our Polish tribute to the gentleman. Fantastic. Okay, Szymon, but what about today? What about today's training? What's the point of doing this today? Okay, so trying to make a long story short. So I've met Shan 10 years ago. In the course of things, I started corresponding with Roy because, you know, I noticed that there are critical thinkers. Because, you know, I noticed that there are critical thinkers. And if you wanted to look into the minds of the people who shape the minds of the firefighters, these people are really critical thinkers. They don't take things for granted. They really question themselves, the usual methods. They never say, we've always done this this way and so on. So Roy was one person like that. And I guess to become friends, there's more than just professional discussions. We also have probably some similar mindsets and so on. I think one of the components I can surely say about these guys is modesty. You know, they've achieved a lot. They've done great things. Sean just shared that he's been around 30 countries, learning, teaching, and so on around the world. That's also great opportunities, you know, to create a global network. So we invited Roy over for instructors workshop, just the best guys in Poland five years ago. And since we're having an anniversary, 10-year anniversary of the first visit of the Australian guys, and they set some course of the first visit of the Australian guys. And they set some course of things to happen at the time. And then we continued with the training program, the investment in infrastructure, learning materials, and so on. So we've created the system. But definitely, I can say that they gave the initial impulse. So we were able to go from trying to imitate something, monkey see, monkey do kind of thing. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to offend anyone, but that's exactly what happened. And it's a story shared by many countries, imitating a model you don't understand by just putting in place things you can visibly see, but you're not understanding. Why are they squirting pulses into the smoke? Why are they using a baffle inside a container? Why are they closing the doors, opening the doors? What's actually happening? And as teachers, we understand that we're driven by some learning objectives. We have to teach them guys something. So first we identify the catalog of competencies and then we work around this with training programs, infrastructure, tools, techniques, methods and so on. So you know that I've been approximately the same time I've been gathering a group of engaged people, really involved people, also people with great personal characteristics, Also people with great personal characteristics, you know, modest, hardworking, honest and so on. And so I've created this group CFB TPL, Compartment Fire Behavior Training. Just a short side note. Roy mentioned it was created in the UK. It's a bit misleading because we're actually structural firefighting, not compartment fire behavior training, not limited to one compartment. That's one of the problems with the training. The term CFT, that's something that the UK created, and it just spread. If you talk to a Swedish firefighter, you know, what's CFT, they will know. Because we don't call it. We just say fire behavior training, or structural firefighting. I think that's a good point. But if you say, well, we do structural firefighting, well, so does everybody in the world. And so what's the difference? Well, we focus on behavior in a compartment, not lighting really big fires with six or seven fires and three dummies and pushing people in the front and making men out of them. The methodology. The methodology. Yeah, the focus is on fire behavior and that's the foundation for everything else. If you don't understand fire behavior, there's no point talking about strategies and tactics or anything advanced. You've got to go back to the basics. Yeah, I love this because this brings me to the question I wanted to ask. You have limited amount of time and there is infinite amount of fires. I've already learned from my life as a fire engineer that every fire will be different. I had interviews, for example, with Professor Guillermo Reyn and Wolfram Jan about the Dalmarnock fires, where they were expecting a certain course of fire. And because there was a rug on a chair somewhere, it kind of changed, you know, the fire behavior there. Like such a tiny detail as a piece of cloth on a piece of furniture and it made the fire different. So given that there is infinite amount of ways how fire can develop, how can one train in infinite amount of time the investigators on what to expect from the fires? How do you approach this variability? Well, basically, it's impossible. Okay. So first you have to acknowledge that it's impossible and then you find a way. If you focus on the fundamentals of fire behavior and then you touch on the main variables on how it can behave, that provides you a foundation. And then that foundation, we then build into what I call reading the fire, something that developed in 1999 and it's gone on and been accepted in many parts of the world. And it's trying to get a model that helps firefighters to arrive at a critical incident where people having the worst day of their lives, they're losing their property, possibly even their family, and unbelievable stress. I think it's the most incredible stress that any civilian will ever have to experience. And as an officer in charge of a firefighting appliance, when you arrive at their job, there's an expectation you're going to get off, give orders, and things are going to start to improve. So we don't even have seconds. I mean, the truck has just come to a stop. You open the door and there's an expectation, I'm going to solve all their problems. So how do you stop time? Yeah, you can't. It's absolutely impossible. So I developed a system that worked for me. You know, I'm not the brightest person on the planet. Under stress, we fall back to very, very simplistic models. So I developed this model of smoke, air, heat, flame. And, you know, you put them in combination, then you've got fire. Smoke, air, heat, flame. Smoke, air, heat, flame. Okay. So not fire. Smoke, air, heat, flame. Okay. So if you look at the triangle of fire, you've got oxygen, which is air. You've got smoke, which is your fuel in our case. Heat is heat. And you put them all together and you've got flame. So I use that as a foundation and I try to develop a model that would allow me to make rapid decisions on the fire ground. When I'd learned all this stuff and I'd applied it 97 to 99 in the training center, went back operationally, I found myself with two shopping lists. I was looking at a fire and said, I say, the shopping list for flashover is this, the shopping list for back shaft is this, what have I got? And it wasn't working for me, it was too complex. So I tried to simplify a system and develop a system that was progressive, and that order is very important, smoke, air, heat, and flame. And it was logical. It worked for me. I put it out to the rest of the world. People made comments on it, and it's pretty well stood the test of time. We've added building an environment as the context in front of that. So my objective with teaching fire behavior is to give these guys an understanding of the typical fire behavior and the variables, and then we focus on the visual patterns. So if we see certain patterns, it suggests certain things. So the thing is that with reading the fire, it's not black and white. It's not, I saw this, therefore this is happening. Most of the indicators are soft indicators. So by themselves, they have limited value. They're suggesting this stage of development. They're suggesting this is happening. When you start to do a 360 and you get more of these visual patterns. What was a 360? So that's arriving at the front of the fire. So you arrive at the front door, and then you go around the building. I do a 360, go around and look at what's happening. Yeah, what's happening at the back, what's happening on each side, and everything else. And I say it's like a jigsaw puzzle. So imagine that somebody's given you 250 pieces of a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and they've said, I want you to tell me immediately what this is. Well, you could put the pieces together and you start to develop a picture, but you're not sure about it. So as the firefighter arrives at the alpha side, the front side, we get a few more pieces of the picture. And the Bravo side, so as we do our 360, we gather a few more pieces of this puzzle. And mostly it's soft information, but that's all we have. And they've questioned, what if you're wrong? You know, well, what if I'm wrong? So the alternative is just to be a robot. And that's what I was the first 14 years of my career. I was a robot. So what we did... No matter what you see, you did this because this is a procedure. The same action. And you'd get certain officers. You know, if you're on with this officer, he was going to go case one. This guy would go case two, double back. This guy would... So they had their favorite approaches. And in defense of that, you'll find that those approaches worked probably 80% of the time. Okay. But it didn't work 100% of the time. So that's what you, if you're wrong, so you have to look at it. Things can work. So you can either just be a robot and do what works most of the time and hope it works all the time, or you can sort of say, no, I'm not going to just go into a robotic mechanical action. I'm going to pause. I'm going to pause. I'm going to make an assessment, and then I might adjust my tactics based on several pieces of soft information I've gathered. And you know what? That's the best we can do. So it's also an ongoing thing. It's not just USS1. Exactly. You apply the cure and it's done. Exactly. It's dynamic. So when I do my initial arrival and my 360, I get certain pieces of information and I start to form opinions. I think, I think this is happening or that's happening. When I look at it a minute later, I might change my mind because I'm seeing something else and thinking, no, I was wrong. My initial assessment was wrong. Now I think it's this. But you're always working on soft information. You have seconds, not minutes, to make decisions that affect people's life and death and their property. It's the most difficult job on the planet to do. And some people say, oh, it's impossible. We tried it. It can't be done. Well, no, it can't be done 100% reliably every time. It's impossible. Anyone who says that if you follow my method, you're going to roll up at a fire, you're going to assess everything that's going on, and you're going to make the right decisions. But what I hope to do is give firefighters simple models that give them indicators. Some of the indicators are screaming at you if you understand fire behavior. What's the depth you want to do the reconnaissance at? Like, you want to know if it's pre-flashover, post-flashover, or you want to know that the temperature in this room is perhaps 1,000 degrees and the corridor next door is 600. How much you need to know to act efficiently? Great question. So I think one of the first things you need to know is where the fire is. And this sounds like a stupid statement. Yeah. But as an engineer, I would assume you know. Like if I call you to my building because I have automation in it, I assume you would know that. So this is maybe a topic that will interest your engineering listeners. So if I tell you, well, what do you use to design a building? You're saying, well, we use the ISO fire. Design fire or something. The same load, the same room, the same size, et cetera. And you use that to design everything. But when you're designing a building, I know you've done it. You have the plans. You're also making the decisions about what the structure is going to be, the size. You know everything. So let's look at Sean's example here. So we are arriving at the fire here. We might have the plans. They might be there, where the fire alarms and main entrance, you know. But it's not telling you where the fire started. Well, you might have a detector, but it's not telling you what did it spread. In most cases, not. In most cases, not. And then, you know, did the window break? Not. The things that the fire engineer is doing is just trying to prevent it and say, well, we have this, we have this. We're going to make this last for this time. We're going to make the section. In my interview with Sean, I said it already that in most of fire engineers' work, you would assume that the moment that firefighters come to the building, my job is done. It's your job now. You're saying like, so what do you need to know? Well, I would love to know exactly where the fire is and how it's spreading. It's just that we don't have that information. So you can use models like Sean has developed in a way. We're doing basically, without calling it that, we're basically doing the same in Sweden. It's the two genesis of the same thing. You develop because you need it, and you need to understand. So you need to understand, you need to understand the basics. You need to understand what is fire behavior, what happens, how does fire behavior, if you have access to air. If it lacks access to air, what happens if it has lacked access to air, and then it gets air? There are phenomenons that are there and they're defined scientifically. And you need to, for us, understand that. But this is the question that an engineer doesn't ask, is that what will I see from the outside if you get to that place at a certain stage in the fire? And that's what Sean is aiming to get. It's interesting now because we're talking about context. And I'm talking about my context, which is generally most of the fires I'm going to are residential fires. Their kids are inside, et cetera, et cetera. This is very important because also a lot of fire engineering would be focused on those, you know, very expensive big buildings, tall skyscrapers, large industrial buildings, complex buildings. Because those are the ones that need fire engineering. Where most of the fires that you attend would be residential. These are the ones that give me the most grief. You arrive at a house on fire, there's smoke coming out from several sides, and there's no fire showing. They are the crappiest fires on the planet. If I've got a window broken and I've got flames coming out of one of the corners, then I'm happy because I know I've got some place to start. But trying to take it back to a fire engineer's perspective, and I'll talk about my experience in fire engineered buildings and the quality of engineering and design in Australia is actually quite good. But you do get times when you arrive at particularly the smaller industrial complexes, the tilt slabs, you don't get a chance to get to the fire alarm panel because it's well involved or it's just not possible to get in. I mean, in a high-rise context, you've got a chance to get into the lobby, you've got a fire control room, which is fire isolated. So you've got all those isolations and that gives you some time. But when you get into a commercial building that doesn't have that, you may not be able to get inside to access the fire alarm panel and get that intel about where exactly the fire is located. It might be beyond your capacity to make entry in there. I'd like to just add something on Shan's model. So he's already far away from it. In terms of noticing how brilliant it is. We are still appreciating it. So be safe, it's called. So this building environment, that's B, and smoke, air, actually air track, heat and flames. So it's safe, we would say in Polish, but safe. Be safe. Be safe. So it tells you something. It's a Australian English. So what do we want to understand from the first letter B? A building. So what's it made of? Where are the windows? Where are the doors? Where's the fire? Or possibly where's the fire? What's the main use of the building? You know? So what's the time of the day versus the current possibility of people being in there? And so on and so forth. Environment was added recently. That's one of the major components. I think it's wind. We so not appreciate wind-driven fires. And I'm really trying to hammer this into the head of Polish firefighters. And as so many people around the world are doing this. So smoke. Smoke tells you a lot of things. Well, you cannot be sure about certain things from its color, but you can have some good guesses. We call this an educated guess. It's not a certainty. It's an educated guess. The velocity of gases, the buoyancy, the hotter they are, the faster they go up. That means they're either very hot or very close to the seat of the fire. One of these things, yeah? Okay, air track. Air track is super important because we know already that what happened in the 70s and 80s in Sweden, that there's a lot of plastics. They burn faster. I just recently had Craig Wessing talking about flow paths, and this is a very popular episode. So this is interchangeable. I understand it's critical, yeah. So air track, we want to go do this 360 to understand B, building, but also air track. See the smoke and understand what is the air track now and what is possible, because we cannot predict which window will fail at what point but we have to but we are responsible for the safety of both citizens inside that building and the firefighters we are committing to that building so the possible air track is one of the major concerns and then heat you know how heat acts flame is kind of one of the most obvious things easy if you can flames, you've got a starting point. Yes, yeah. But I showed a couple years ago, I showed at the conference in Olsztyn that we're going to next week, two pictures, you know, fully engulfed, windows full of flames, and just smoke issuing from a lot of windows. And I said, which one of these you would prefer to fight? Or a lot of windows. And I said, which one of these you would prefer to fight? Or which one of these is more dangerous? You know, in a way, you tend to say that more fire, more danger. No, not at all. You'll not commit firefighters inside a burning inferno. They have to make their way into it. But when it's full of smoke, it's actually full of combustible gases. So, I can actually make the analogy here that my mentor used to do. He would put two buildings and say, well, we have a building here. We have a fire. We have full of smoke. We know that smoke contains funnels. And then we have the other one, and we have a gas leak there, propane. Okay, so which one of these two is more dangerous? We have propane, but it's burning? Well, he will actually give them the alternative. Would you commit if we have a leak of propane? I can just ask you your argument. No, why? I'm not doing it. Of course, you're not committing people there. Basically, because if you can stop the leak... Because it's uncertain. Well, if I have a building and I have a leak to propane, you know, and I really don't know how much has leaked, you know, propane has a certain flammability range, etc. If that ignites, that can happen very slowly or it can have a very explosive. So that means you're not really worried about the flame or the heat exposure. Well, this can actually become a dynamic event. You can have structural damage, and the body doesn't really tolerate that much pressure. But if you tell the students, you know, well, here we have full flame and we have smoke, which means there's more fire, more flames, and that's dangerous. It's really not because you will not commit to that fire. But to the fire where the smoke is, which is unburned fuel that doesn't have no visibility. It's there. You don't really know how much of it is pilots, gas, etc. One of the things I'm most passionate about is educating firefighters about what we call fire gas ignition. We've got everyone everyone reasonably understands flash over and back draft. These occur in the room of origin or just outside the room of origin. But what Roy's talking about there was this perceived danger. We've got an LPG leak. No way I'm going in there. But what firefighters fail to realize is that pyrolysis, smoke. So when products are pyrolyzing, it's at much lower temperature. In the modern plastics, as low as 150 to 250. With wood, it was 350. So the neighboring products in that fire compartment are pyrolyzing, and that is extremely fuel-rich, unburned hydrocarbons. That is extremely fuel-rich, unburned hydrocarbons. And so the scenario that I often quote is, you've got a house fire, which is my primary context, but imagine you're at the front door and you have to go down a long corridor and the fire's up the back on the left-hand side. So when you open the door, you encounter smoke that's not very hot and you think it's not very hot. And you think it's not dangerous because something in our brain says hot, black, rich smoke, danger Will Robinson. But it flows out of that room. As it moves down the corridor, it's pre-mixing to some extent. So it's cooling. So by the time it gets 10 meters down the corridor, it's no longer extremely hot. It's no longer black. It's been diluted. And you could probably walk in with a t-shirt and shorts on at that environment. And so your perception of danger is zero. And the reality is the danger is extreme because now not only do you have the unburned fuel from the smoke, like in the smoke layer, it's mostly fuel, and below the smoke layer, it's mostly air. It's diffusion. As this stuff rolls down the corridor and through the building, there's a certain level of premixing. And when we premix fuel, unburned fuel, with air, we can get a burning velocity 10 times greater than a diffusion mixture. And this is what's catching firefighters. This is what's killing our colleagues around the world, is this lack of understanding that just because the smoke is cold, just because it's grey, that it's safe. It's extremely dangerous. It's more dangerous than the black smoke you can see. And it's just such an area that's lacking in understanding. So, you know, my passion is to educate firefighters about fire, gas, ignition, and the dangers of cumulative smoke in ceiling boards or remote areas. So I start feeling a bit better what you try to teach those guys in here in your training, try to teach those guys in here in your training? Because I believe you try to replicate these observations that you just made from years and years of experience as a firefighter into a controlled environment where you can just repeat this and showcase this. So it's difficult to show all of these indicators. So it's been my journey started in 1997 and it's still continuing today. And everywhere I go, I'm picking up more information from people. My quest is to make one of the most complex chemical reactions on the planet with an enormous number of variables into something that can be recognized in seconds and responded to. It's impossible. But, you know, we have to try to be able to do that. So we use different methodologies. We use small scale. We use theory. We use multimedia. We use larger scale. And it's still a journey. There's so many things that I understand. But passing that knowledge on, and I'm always trying to make what's complex more simple so that it can be absorbed. It's stuff that's taken me over 20 years to absorb and understand. And I've got one week with these guys, and I'm trying to pass on what took me 20 years to work out in one week. Luckily, they all understand a little bit of this already. Well, they're instructors. If I were to just take what you're saying, Sean, and just go one step back, you know, the higher. So what you're saying, so what's the goal? And I think, so I have to go back to Sweden. So what's the goal with the training there? The goal is like, we don't want to train robots. We want firefighters. So here's the most stupidest of all things. If you ask any firefighter anywhere on the world, I think most of them, if not all, will tell you, have you heard the term, no fire is like another? Like the no fires are the same. And at the same time, we want one tool, one procedure, standard operations procedures to do this. We will do everything the same way. He says, show me what you do. We will do this. It doesn't matter. So it's kind of like a double morality today where you're saying, of course, all the fires are different, but we will solve them the same way every time. I don't want to train something. I don't want a firefighter that just will do what he was trained to do and he will do that all the time. What I want is that someone that comes to a fire, assess the situation, and then applies the best tactic, the best method for that specific situation or particular fire. But there is an issue here that requires what that requires understanding and then it requires thinking so some people like it some look like most well you know how many times i've heard you know i'm talking about water i'm talking about extinguishing techniques and they say i'm talking about the bollocks and i'm talking about the energy and i'm talking about direct indirect i'm talking about fire bollocks, I'm talking about the energy, I'm talking about direct, indirect, I'm talking about fire gas cooling. And the guy said, yeah, it's all nice and well, but what do I have to do with a nozzle? How long do I have to open it? What cone should I have? And I said, well, what you're asking me is the equivalent of you asking me, I'm going to drive from northern Sweden to southern Italy. How many degrees do I need to turn the wheel of my car in order to get there? And then I have to ask, you know, that's where the famous, it depends, basic concepts. It's not. It's not. It's true. But here's the thing. So I will then say, well, what car or what vehicle are you going to drive? Are you going to drive a tractor or Lamborghini? What vehicle are you going to drive? Are you going to drive a tractor or a Lamborghini? What road are you going to drive on? Are you going to drive on pavement? Are you going to on the highway or just the smaller roads? Are you going to do dirt road? Daytime, nighttime? What time of the year are you going to drive on the snow? Are you going to drive on the... So that makes sense to you, everything I'm saying. Because you don't even question, of course, you will adapt your driving to the road and to the road conditions and stuff like that, and the vehicle you're driving. So why is that not controversial in any way? But then I have to tell the students, no, you know, just use, just open for two seconds in a 43 degree angle and a 60 degree angle, and that will work. And I'll say, well, guys, what are we trying to achieve? Well, if I'm doing gas cooling, well, I want to cool the gases in this room. That's this room. The room we are in now, it's just a few meters, so that doesn't take. But if it's 10 by 10 or 20 by 20 or whatever, so that changes stuff. So you need to adapt. They don't like it because it means I cannot give them, I cannot quantify specifically what they need to understand, so they need to adapt. They want a simple way to react that's going to work every time. Because it's damn stressful. Okay. You arrive and people have the worst days. I don't think any force engineer is going to appreciate actually the stress component. So I've spent, you know, the most of my career, 38 years as an officer, and the guy in the front seat, and everyone's looking to me, the driver, the two guys in the back, the people whose house is burning down. They're looking for me to make rapid decisions, and it's extremely difficult. And Roy's sort of leading to a bit of a paradox here, isn't he? Because ideally, we'd have firefighters. The simplest method is, I'm a robot, I do the same thing every time, and it probably works 80% of the time in your context. What we're trying to do is move beyond that robotic approach, and we're trying to develop at least officers, at least the decision makers, to be able to take a deep breath and say, okay, guys, lay out those lines, get your breathing apparatus ready. Don't go inside, but be prepared. I'm going to do an assessment. I'm going to do a 360. It takes about 60 seconds. The time you come back is sort of say, right, plan A is we're going in through here. We're trying to go beyond one tool, one tactic, and one technique. And it's not easy to do. And I think there's a good point for simplifying things. A great example today was door entry technique. Okay. So we talked about how do we do door entry technique? Well, how do we do it? Well, there's many different opinions about how we do it. So I don't even ask the question, how do we do it? I say, what do we want to achieve? You are in a hallway. You've got smoke over your head. You don't know what's behind the door. What do we want to achieve? Oh, we want to do this. No, we want to cool the gases. We want to cool the linings. We want to do everything in our favor. So that's my approach is not to sort of say, I could have said today, okay, guys, this is how you do door entry, X, Y, Z, and off you go and everything's okay. And a lot of people, they become robots. And some firefighters say, this is too complicated. Just tell me what to do. And we're trying to move beyond that. And we had this wonderful discussion today. It went on for 45 minutes or an hour. CFPTPL. It went on for 45 minutes or an hour. C-E-T-P-L. It went on for 45 minutes an hour. Everyone had different opinions. Should we leave the door open? Should we close the door? Yes, we should. No, we shouldn't. And I said, well, what's the advantages of closing? What's the advantages of opening? And there's pros and cons to all these. We were going to a place where this is better than that. And I remember that we had to step in a couple of times and say, well, what if you have this scenario? What you are saying makes sense. But what if you have this other scenario? When you open the door, there's something else happening there. So we come back to this. You need to adapt to the situation. You know, that's the thing. You know, and I'd love to say, okay, always close the door. Always open the door. Set the cone to 38.5 degrees. Open it. I'd love to be able to say it's that simple, but it's not that simple. So it's like, I feel like when there was a fire in Notre Dame Cathedral, Donald Trump was tweeting, just send the fire planes. Water bomb has dropped. What could possibly go wrong? Actually, that was probably the method to fight fires everywhere in the world for some time, just to drown it. But the water damage that you're doing, you know, it's like in every place in the world that people are starting actually to look at the hands of the firefighters and question them. It's on trial right now in Poland after the five teen girls died in the, what's it called, escape room in Poland because the linings were made out of chipboard and they were locked inside, you know. Like everybody's on scrutiny. The medical, the EMTs, the firefighters, not to mention the owners. What I'd like to say is that, of course, first of all, advertise episode 51, because I already said it on the Fire Science Show. Secondly, everybody listening to it has to give a five-star review. High five. Yeah. Five-star review on all the platforms that you're listening to, because I'm sure you're having such fun as we are having right now, sitting in the school tender room in Gdansk. But my friends will surely admit and agree that one thing, you have to be very knowledgeable in fire science, to a degree, of course. But secondly, it takes a lot to become a great teacher. You know, that's something else. That's another field that you have to really be great at. An open mind is a good start. Yes, open mind. It's modesty. You have to be able to talk to people, interact with them, not create barriers, engage them into conversation, you know, treat them as professionals, and at the same time be modest enough to offer them something that will probably put them on another path in their career, but not to create a barrier between yourself and them. And so many other things. That's also something that, for example, if you want to be a great teacher, you have to study it or learn it by doing it or or reading about it but not only you have to have some personal qualities characteristics you know so there's only so many uh great teachers around the world and i'm i'm happy to sit with at least two of them in this room when it comes to cfbt not to mention yourself. You're doing a great job, Wojciech. Well, I'm listening to this and thinking, so you, Sean, you have the displeasure to work with me in a couple of times, and you have heard my lesson, etc. So, well, you see, here's the big issue. I'm spoiled. You know, I come from the country that developed a lot of the stuff that's been done around the world. It's put a lot of time and resources into both the educational system, the facilities, and Sweden, I think, is the only country that has a two-year education today for the firefighters. So I have time, and I have that time, and I use it, of course. But more than that, I just want to talk a little about instructor and instructors courses what i've seen a lot of is you are taken into an instructor's course and and i'll see okay what's the plan what are you going to when are you going to be presented that and if the instructor maybe giving you a deeper knowledge into something maybe running some exercises where you are the student etc you're learning that so this is what my mentor discovered years ago was that that's not enough because there's a human side of this so there is a what i tell you and what you perceive that's not necessarily the same thing yeah pedagogy so you need to understand that people what i say what the words I choose is one thing, what you perceive that day, specifically that day, maybe you didn't have sleep, maybe you're having some issues at home or at work or wherever. It's one thing that two people can hear the same thing, but they can interpret it differently. So that's why repetition and your assurance. So it comes to the point, if you're going to teach instructors, you also have to evaluate their instructor ability, their ability to instruct. And I don't see that many places. So Sean has that, you know, and some other places that you need to evaluate them. So it's not just deliver them. Here's the knowledge and go home and teach them. And then what are they teaching? How are they teaching it? So I was running a course, I think it was 2009 in Valencia with a colleague and we were evaluating every single word choice they were doing, how they were presenting, not just the concept of the actual subject matter, but it's also the way of delivery. And the students had the first week of that course to compare to what we delivered the knowledge and then it would be delivered by the instructors for their, you know. So that's an important part of us as well because I'm just thinking about what the qualities of an instructor should be but also what the requirements for calling something an instructor course should be. I just want to say something about where Poland is now. And I think that I want to make it very clear that it's 2023 and Poland's starting off on CFBT. These two guys have come over and they're going to tell them how to do it properly. That is not the case. Poland has done something extraordinary. So Shimon has been a fire service leader. He's looked around the world. He's brought various experts over 10 years ago. Yeah. And 10 years ago, CFBT wasn't on the radar. But he put it on the radar. He introduced us to the right people. We made connections. And through the efforts he made and the networking, we were able to convince the senior management that, hey, we need to go this way. What I find absolutely mind-blowing is you've gone from, well, what is CFBT 10 years ago to what a year later you're calling tenders or this most amazing multi-compartment, multi-level dollhouse, as I've learned you call them today. It's a pretty sophisticated dollhouse. I mean, there's a standard prop that was designed by Chimon, and it's just amazing. You can do absolutely everything, multi-compartment, tactical ventilation, you name it, if your imagination's the limit. So this prop was designed. Well, that's been done before. Chimon might, you know, it's a very good prop. It may be better. It may not be. But what is absolutely amazing is that became a national model. You see them everywhere. That's the, so that's not, the amazing thing is not that it became a national model, but there's 23 of them? 22. 22 of them across the country. So what we've got is this national fire service with a national direction, that when the space of a year and a half has gone from what is CFBT to this mind-blowing practical prop in 22 locations across the country. It's not just a prop. It's called system. Exactly. It's books. Exactly. The prop, the hardware is useless without software. Exactly. The hardware is useless without software. So what Shimon, he's taken in, he's able to take in information, and not just from me, but other people. He's taken the best of what he's got internationally. And so not only has he developed the hardware, that's only half the battle, probably less than half the battle. Mind you, it's pretty impressive. You already have millions to do that. And you have 22 of them across the country. No one has ever done that. I think that's historic. It's never been achieved anywhere. But then to link it up with the software. And so here we are 10 years later. And why am I here? Because I've been doing this for 25 years or more in 28 different countries and et cetera, et cetera. But what I wanted several years ago was to have something more than saying, come on, it's a Shandorff, of course, it's the best in the world. I wanted to have external validation. So I chose the Institution of Fire Engineers. Not an easy process. I started in 2017. By 2018, I jumped through all the hoops and I was able to satisfy the requirements of the Institution of Fire Engineers recognised training course. So basically, I'm able to put their logo on it. They value their logo. They don't want to give it to anybody. So when I issue a certificate, if they've been assessed and they've all passed, that's a criteria. I give them a certificate with this logo on it. So it's more than me. It's an external validation of an independent organization with credibility that says, yeah, we looked at this. We're confident we can do that. And I must say that I've trained all over the world, and this is the first group I've thrown some questions, fundamental questions at people, and they get them wrong. This is the first group that has the right answers. So this is like a walk in the park because I'm trying to trick these guys. I'm saying, because there's a certain number of things that are counterintuitive. What is white smoke? What is this? And they always give the wrong answer. These guys are giving the right answer every time. They've been changed. So exactly right. So this is just putting the icing on the cake. This is great. This is quality assessment of the instructors. Yeah. If your instructors are good, there's a good chance the trainees will be good. So with all the luck and fortune that I had to meet the right people, probably some of the courage to ask them simple questions that would reveal my ignorance as well in the process. I would like to think that my grandmother taught me modesty, you know, my late grandmother. I did a TEDx on that. Modesty got me into CERN. Modesty got me into many places. There's still more. I'm attempting to identify proper people. And I'm so fortunate to have these guys over there in the PSP Florian site that we rented for the course that are such great guys. I would say that probably I'm an activist. I have all the kind of things going inside my mind. A lot of them know a lot of things more than I do on many subjects. And then I'm trying to connect them with the network of friends that I have because I care. In the long run, I care that we produce firefighters that rescue people from fires. And the quality of life is satisfying. So we want efficiency and we want to do it safely. It's actually fantastic to work with people that are so professionally minded and focused and prepared to make changes. An interesting thing happened today. We were talking about door entry and, you know, I kept asking questions about what do we need to achieve and they kept telling me how we think we should achieve it. And I said, well, I want to know that. I want to know what we need to achieve. Then we got to how can we achieve it. It was a fascinating discussion from one of your students, Machen, and he challenged me. And, you know, I said, well, I'd start here at the door, and I'd cool progressively. Yeah, you know, and I'm thinking, I don't think you're right. But then he started telling me things. I'm thinking, gee, you may be right. So I never stop learning. And there's so many things that I think I know really well. And then every now and then someone challenges me and gets me thinking. So I'm not saying he's right and I'm wrong. But I tell you what, he's got me wondering and I want to find out. I think I share this with you every day. I'm especially being blessed with the podcast and having these great critical thinkers come here and change my mind. I'm truly blessed learning every day and that's the journey I try to take. The listener with me and with us. It's not easy for someone to tell you you're wrong. The trouble is that you have a responsibility. So if what Marcin is saying is true, then I need to say, consider it and sort of say, right, well, what's the best thing? Well, the best thing for me in the future is to teach it as well. If I had to summarize, like, what do you want from the firefighters? Like, what do you want to implant in their ass? It's the ability to critically think and take the best decision, given the information you have, and not be scared to reassess, re-evaluate, and adjust to the best of your knowledge every time. Challenge everything. I think it's a healthy thing to be able to challenge what the traditional teaching is. I'll give you an example. I was doing a tactical ventilation course in Italy, and one of my students was from the USA. And I gave my talk about negative pressure ventilation. I think I got two slides saying that was originally when we did mechanical ventilation, it was negative pressure ventilation. And then we worked out it wasn't any good, and we went to positive. And this guy said, well, hang on, we use negative pressure ventilation a lot. So I'm thinking, I think you're wrong because everything I've ever been taught says you're wrong. PPV is better. So I said, okay, well, let's try. Let's do an exercise where we do the exercise with PPV and you can lead the negative pressure ventilation one. And I was rather surprised how effective the negative pressure ventilation was. So now I've got to totally rethink my thoughts on negative pressure ventilation, because he challenged me, and when we put it to the test, he showed me that it has some advantages. It's that the role of the instructor is not to be right and just to tell people what to do. I think without getting too philosophical on this one, the role of the instructor is to convey, I mean, like every other education, is to make you think and to make you evaluate and to teach you how to think and what to evaluate and etc. And then you have to get to a point when the students actually i'm very happy when the students are they know more than me in a topic you know they develop it yeah but you know roy since the course we did this and this and because i always tell them well if you go to a course today this is a lot of stuff is happening all the time so in five years in years, that might not be correct. And I had discussions with students that said, well, Roy, but we were here at this college 10 years ago, five years ago. And I said, yeah, but what do you work with? And they said, well, can you use the knowledge to learn when you started? And I said, no, no, no, no, because the relations have changed and everything. So why are you asking me then that things have changed? And they have to change because we were learning. Otherwise, we're not evolving. The world is always changing and knowledge is increasing. Another classic example would be the UL research into transitional attack and putting water in from outside survivability. So they did this incredible amount of research, mind-blowing quality. And prior to that research coming out, I had this policy, well, good firefighters always attack from the inside. They don't stick hose lines in from outside because that kills people. And that's what I've been teaching all of my life. And then when I sat down and looked at the research they've done, I had to admit that I was wrong. And I've been teaching this for a long time. And it's not easy to do, but I wasn't the only one. You know, I think there was almost everybody in the world had the same opinion that external attack footpath firefighters, the lowest form of firefighting, the real heroes get inside from attack from the unburned portion. But they showed that if you use the right nozzle techniques, you can actually improve conditions and increase survivability for people inside the building. And limit exposure to carcinogenic agents. Exactly. Gentlemen, I feel horrible because I have to stop you. We're like one and a half hour of a one-hour podcast. So time for final words. Roy. Final words. There is no one technique. Yeah. There is no one method. There is no one tool. Listen, if there were, someone would be very rich right now. The problem that I see, so if any FIFO artists are listening to this, or, you know. I hope they are. So there is no one technique. There isn't. What you need to do is you need to have a certain amount of tools, certain methods, and you need to have the understanding to know when do I use what. That will be my final words on that topic. Shimon, yours? Oh That will be my final words on that. Shimon, yours? Oh, gee. Never stop learning. Never be afraid to ask questions. That will get you to meet the most fantastic people in the world that we're having in this room right now. And hopefully you'll be able to also make friends with them. Be modest. Yeah. I really welcome people that challenge me. And I think that we're frightened of critics. Criticism is seen as a negative thing. It's not a negative thing. If Shimon is challenging me because he has an open mind and he really wants to say, I don't agree with this. He's got an open mind and he's saying, prove to me that you're right. And if I'm prepared to accept him as being genuine, I'm able to look at what he's saying and adapt to it. So I think criticism has a negative connotation and it needs to be changed. A true critic is somebody who's open to change. They're challenging you to improve their understanding. Once again, my passion is're challenging you to improve their understanding. Once again, my passion is teaching firefighters how to do the impossible, arriving at a structure fire when lives and property are on the line and you have seconds to make decisions. We're not talking minutes. We're talking seconds. When the pump stops rolling and you open the door, the public is expecting you to take action immediately. And you don't have enough information to do that. It's a fact. And so what you've got to do is start something, do size-ups, and continually reassess what's going on there, because things do change. And by comparing the initial time frame of arrival with a minute later and two minutes later, you start to gather more information. Thank you very much. Thank you. And that's it. Thank you for listening. This episode was really long so I'm not going to add much besides saying thank you very much, Shimon, for inviting me for your very nice workshop. Very happy to meet Sean and Romy. I've learned today a lot about firefighting craft and firefighters mentality and your charisma. Inspiring, interesting. Thanks once again. And for all the listeners, I hope to see you here again next Wednesday. If everything goes well, I'm going to have something really, really nice to share with you. I'm building a resource base that's going to be very helpful for especially ones that are just starting their journey in the fire. So look forward for the next week. See you here again. Thank you. Bye. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
