 Hello everybody and welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 46. Today, a little different than usual, we have a crossover episode with Gus Gagliardi of the Fire Code Tech Podcast. For Gus, it's his second anniversary of podcasting, so all the best Gus, excellent achievement, and I wish you all the best in your future journeys in fire podcasting. And for myself, well, when i have started this project i was certainly not the first fire podcaster out there and i have found gus i was very into podcasting anyway and i found a fire podcast which was very interesting and for quite a long time i comprehended maybe i could do a thing like that on my own actually Actually, Gus was quite nice and invited me to participate in one of his show episodes. And for me, that was like the final test if I can do it. And it worked out quite well, I think. And I thought, well, fire science show project may actually be a reality and within the reach. So here we are today. So I definitely owe to Gus for inviting me and sharing his podcasting passion with me. And that was another reason to pursue my own goals. So thank you very much, Gus. Fire Code Tech podcast is all about engineering, fire safety engineering, and career development. So there's a lot of interesting things, a little different than we do here in Fire Science Show, but still very interesting points of view, very interesting people, really great resource for all the professionals in the world. So I would highly recommend it. And in today's episode, we try to merge the best of the two podcasts. So a really nice conversation about what it is to be a fire safety engineering, how one develops into what they are in the later of their career, how your perspective changes as your career evolves, going from very to not lose sight on the bigger image of the fire science and fire safety, because as you probably noticed in many of the episodes of the podcast, the main problem mentioned was that we don't think holistically. We don't look at the bigger image. So I think it's necessary to understand the implications of the decisions taken while designing fire safety. And this is what we've tried to discuss in here. It's especially valuable for the young engineers who are just starting their pathways. But I think also to all of you dinosaurs in charge, you're the ones creating the spaces for the young people. So maybe you should give it a chance as well. I think everyone should give it a chance. It's a good episode. So I hope you enjoy this crossover fire science co-tech show. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the fire science show. My name is'm here with my friend and co-host, Gus Gagliardi. Hey, Gus. Hey, thanks for having me on the podcast, Wojciech. Excited to be speaking with you. joined your show some time ago that was my first experience speaking and it was on the radio and it was pretty cool that was like a year ago a lot has changed for me but how's the time going for you how was the experience building a podcast oriented around fire engineering for you man it's been so fun and yeah it's been really fun for me to watch you get some success and just like people viewing and getting to see what you're doing. But for me, it's been I've been having so much fun professionally and with Fire Code Tech. The last year has been a lot of career building, just started a new role for a new fire protection engineering firm. protection engineering firm. And yeah, so working on building the podcast and still trying to get great guests and dream big about what kind of content and different pieces of media that I can produce for the field. For me, I'm always excited. I think I'm easily excitable, but yeah, it's been fun, been building. Yeah. I think for myself, when I make this, I make it as much for my audience as for myself and try to learn as much as I can go. That was the thing that made me start the show in the first thing, to learn as much from the best people I can find around. And for you, the twist in your career, you've developed a lot in the last year. I guess it was as valuable to learn while sharing right yeah i mean yeah same for me wojcik i started the podcast because i was early in my career and i'd kind of reached a plateau where i wanted to learn more and there was like kind of a set track of how I could develop. And that wasn't fast enough for me. And so I wanted to reach out to people selfishly and pick their brain on different technical topics and professional development topics and really kind of grow as a professional. And for me, it was just like when it worked 10 times better than I thought it would, honestly, for the social part of it and for the professional and technical part of it. So, yeah, similar, similar thing. Wojciech? Fantastic. I think the important part of our job in running our shows is to infect the mind of young engineers with some really solid engineering. And we're both a similar age. We both have joined commercial activities, engineering activities. And I must tell you, when I joined engineering, my view over the world of fire engineering and the problems in the world of fire engineering was so different than what I see today after the year of doing this show. And you're doing it for more than a year. And by the way, you've always asked people to tell their story in your show. What's your story, man? I don't think I've heard that one. Yeah, so I started and got my degree at Oklahoma State University. Grew up in Edmond, Oklahoma. That's in the center of the country, just right above Texas. I always tell people when I'm out of the country because Oklahoma is much less known. Grew up in Edmond. Went to school at Oklahoma State, got a degree in fire protection and safety technology. So I went to school for fire protection. Some people are surprised by that. Graduated with my degree and went to work for a fire suppression contracting company. So I got to see, yeah, I got to see the nuts and bolts of how sprinkler systems are put together and do hydraulic calculations and design just north of Oklahoma in Nebraska. So I was in Omaha for about a year. I learned a lot and it's been a big impact to this day on the hydraulics and kind of the fine-tuned. Some engineers, they always stay high-level systems and they never get down into the nuts and bolts. So for me, that's a valuable piece of my puzzle in figuring out how those systems work. Moved back to Oklahoma City where I got a job in fire protection engineering. And yeah, worked for a firm, FSB, for about four and a half years. And yeah, really saw a wide variety of projects, aviation projects. I worked on a lot of aircraft hangars and Department of Defense jobs. I probably, you know, I was involved in about six or seven or eight flight simulators for a variety of aircrafts, local jobs, national jobs. I did work across the country, everywhere from San Diego all the way to LaGuardia. So I got to see a wide variety of fire protection across the nation in that role. And really everything from high expansion foam systems to hazardous materials and their storage and high industrial use cases. So that was where I really cut my teeth as an engineer and learned what does it mean to problem solve and to really be code compliant and to solve problems on a national level and with a variety of authorities having jurisdiction. And so, yeah, started the podcast in 2020, April 2020, so almost two years now. So was at kind of a two, three year step into my career and really just gained enough competency to realize how much I didn't know. And then got this new role with just working with a couple other fire protection engineers at a really small firm. There's only three of us and we're in Edmond again, close to where I grew up. So now working on hangars still, working on a variety of DOD and commercial projects and getting to learn a lot more about the business side of things and project management and a wider variety of fire protection engineering. So that's really my story. of fire protection engineering. So that's really my story. That's a proper engineering career. And I think a lot of the people can relate to that in both of our audiences, that that's what you do. You finish your course where you probably have received quite wide knowledge from the fire safety. And I assume in many places it will be different in my school we were strongly experiencing the firefighter tactics and stuff like that because it was firefighters academy and actually almost non-smoke control which kind of ended up hilarious because i became a smoke control expert but that that was a twist in the career but you mentioned like you go down when you exit this school when you exit this wide world of learning from every side of fire and engineering you suddenly find yourself in the this hole of doing nuts and bolts of your systems and oh man i've been there as well. I've started learning about smoke control. Then I started designing them. Then I started doing CFD for them. And three years into my professional career, I knew everything about shopping more smoke control. That was my bread and butter. But then if I look from that experience, from my today's eyes, from my today's knowledge, experience from my today's eyes from my today's knowledge even just taking my academic career aside even just from the podcast view where again i am exploring the broad ocean of fire i i start wondering like how do we sustain you know this connection for young engineers with the broad context of fire are we in a wrong way building them as silos where they just go down the rabbit hole of designing one type of system they become super expert like in hydraulic calculations but maybe they don't know that much about evacuation and then in 10 years they will forget everything they've learned at the school like how we preserve this environment where people are exposed to white fire science well obviously don't tell me you start the podcast because i will not take that answer yeah well i was going to start off with the self-congratulating answer of uh we're doing something here to help promote but you know i think it's interesting to me when you speak to technicians or people who are more involved of installation, it's very siloed. But like you're saying, engineering can also be very siloed, you know, constricted to the whatever occupancies that you commonly deal with or whatever system types that you commonly deal with. I think for one of the ways that I always like to keep knowledgeable about these things is, you know, whatever professional sized societies or technical resources that you can find to really stay intact with these subjects. Pick up a SFPE magazine or a blog article about data centers. If you don't ever work on data centers and you want to learn about common protection features and asset protection and life safety for these structures, how we promote it for the youth or like I think about a lot the idea of how to bring people even into fire protection, which is a struggle as well. In the States, I think that like, and maybe globally as well, I'm not as sure, but in the States, it's a really hard education piece to like even make students aware that fire protection exists. They might know that being a mechanical engineer or a civil engineer or structural engineer is a thing, but they might not never understand that fire protection is a thing. So I think it's a struggle on a lot of levels. Don't know if that answers your questions. I recall I've met once a girl who just finished her architectural studies in Poland, and I've asked her, so what did you learn about fire safety as a newly trained architect? And she was like, yeah, if I put sprinklers in my building, I can do one-hour walls instead of two-hour walls, and that's pretty much it. And I'm like, wow, that's not a very thorough explanation on what the profession of fire protection engineering is. And I think a lot of that comes also from us, the engineers of the community, because we also sometimes lose the grasp on what the important topics are or what the important issues are. In my podcast, I very rarely had people who tell me that the roughness of the pipe is critical for fire safety or that some specific nuance of designing smoke control makes all the difference. They were rather that we are not talking with each other, we are designing in silos, we are not looking at the bigger picture, we do not have defined goals of our analysis. Doesn't such a similar image come from your show? You have more engineers like people working on these big projects. So what's the collective mind of Firecotech say about the big issues in fire and are we really addressing them? Yeah, I think that this new firm that I've been working at, Rated Engineering, they are really concerned with this idea. This idea that the contractor is not speaking with the engineer and the engineer has a varying level of competency and the project team has a varying level of competency. But how do we make this engineering team, as I've heard people describe it before, I had a whole episode about that, but how do we make this engineering team function better? And, you know, I've talked to people recently at conferences and really trying to needle this idea, what kind of things can we do as a team better? What's lacking in our documents? The one issue that I found is that water supply seems to be a big issue in the States, and maybe this is everywhere. ensuring that you have data about the water supply and correct data and calibrated data and data that is acquired using the right methods. So that seems to be a really big issue in my local community. And I can also speak a little bit on a national scale as well. But that's something I see for sure, Wojciech,, in making the engineering team better. I usually struggle crossing lines between different groups of interest on the project. Jumping on architects because I need a new shaft and it's impossible. Jumping on electricians because I will need more power, it's impossible. I need a fan in this location. It's very hard. We need to cut costs. We need to make it more economically feasible. And then again, you fight for safety. You want to design the safest building you can that's feasible to build, obviously, but it's a really safe one. I don't want to design unsafe systems and unsafe buildings, and that's probably the goal of us all. And then you meet the expectations on the other side that are not very well defined. Like, okay, you want a safe building, but tell me what safety is for you, like how we define it, what's the goal of the project. And we're really lacking in this discussion. I think the.S. may be slightly different because in U.S. the authority having jurisdiction is this strong party. I assume, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Am I wrong? It depends on where. It depends on the population size, honestly, and how much money that enforcing entity has in order to fund these professionals that review these drawings. So if you're talking about L.A., then yes, it's a very strong authority and probably rivals many globally, you know, as far as restrictiveness and, you know, how much they care and and the letter of the law being followed to a T, then yeah, L.A. But if you're talking about rural Oklahoma, maybe, I don't know, some far corner of Oklahoma where it's governed by a very small city authority, it might not be the case. So it really depends. But you touched on great points. I wanted to just say, like like that coordination thing is so difficult and also like having a discussion with the project stakeholders and trying to determine what is the risk tolerance of the owner i think that's a conversation that i've been really thinking about a lot lately but one thing before we go on i just wanted to turn the table on you and ask for my listeners that you give a little bit of discourse on the fire science show what you know people can go check it out and we'll drop some links for people to go click on it and check it out but I want to flip the table on you because I know your listeners would like hearing it too from you about give me just your elevator pitch on the fire science show oh man uh where to start uh i hope the elevator ride is long that's that's a challenging one yeah i i think i i've made this show to give hardcore fire science no bullshit just straight as it is from the people i i trust they know what they're saying. And the point is, fire science is so goddamn vast. I said it on the show a few times. I knew it's going to be wide. I knew it's going to be crazy jumping from combustion to evacuation to wildfires to structural fire engineering. I've expected that. but boy, I did not expect how wide it is and how many aspects are there in the science. And the goal of the show is to give them the same justice, you know, to give them the same in-depth look to investigate what's important for them, what is interesting in them. So people are actually exposed to it. I don't expect people will learn from it fully. If your expectation is to learn from one hour podcast episode, that's probably unrealistic because it takes time to learn. But just being exposed to something, you know that something exists, what problems are in there, what it means to do something really on a very high level, you suddenly start to realize the connections, the problems, the issues. And if you ever find a problem like this in your life, you may already have a path in your brain built to where to find the knowledge and how to solve it. So, and also, I want to break those silos between disciplines and break the silo between science and engineering. That's a tough one to break. Because, like, now I'm talking as a virtual scientist, we communicate through peer-reviewed papers, which are probably horrible to read and even worse when you are an engineer. And there's a reason for that, because if you write a paper for a journal that is very, like, engineering report, that's the first thing the reviewer is going to pick on you. Oh, this reads like an engineering report, not a scientific paper. That's a horrible review, but, man, I've received so many of them. So there's a reason why this is built in a way of like inaccessible way. And I really felt bad about this. And then you go to a conference, you meet all these fantastic people, you go for a beer with them, and you can talk about this fire science for hours. And it's fun. It's's not like it's not a trip to hell it's fun and i thought man maybe we can recreate this somewhere online and people could actually enjoy some of that and i really i hope they are and in future i probably think they are yeah i hope they are and in future i would also like to get maybe more engineering in the science show because I think it's important. You have a lot of fantastic engineers and they are very good at defining the missing links. What do we really need? And I think this discourse between science and engineering is something we really need in our communities. Like, there is no point to do fire science if it doesn't end up in fire engineering. And there is no way you can do fire engineering neglecting the fire science, right? Yeah, I think it's remarkable. I was talking to somebody recently who worked in like the tech transfer department at a university. So helping research get integrated into more physical aspect of things. But yeah, I think that's definitely a struggle, the divide between academia and like engineering. And in my head, I think about a lot like technology and, you know, like how we could problem solve better and different ways to protect and keep people safe and how that really gets me excited. But then if you talk to the engineering community, at least in the States, it seems like they are not as concerned with that or they're more concerned with like fire science and these kind of high minded like ideas about fire behavior and like different things. But when I think that's partially, you know, driven by how these two entities get paid, you know, but I think that, yeah, it's something that we need to look at as a community, which is how to close this feedback loop between engineering and fire scientists. And, you know, I think that the states are experiencing a slow shift towards performance-based design. And I think performance-based design presents a lot more opportunities for scientists and engineers to work together. Unfortunately, if you keep it purely prescriptive, it's a bit more bureaucratic and it provides less of those opportunities. I think that also goes back to the way how science is funded. With research grants, you get money for research and research, by assumption, must be innovative. It must be, you know, this new best idea. It is difficult to get grants funded to improve an existing technology because if the improvement is so evident, why don't the industry pay for that? And you get this ping pong back from a wall with grant ideas like that. So there's definitely these boundaries artificially placed there through funding. But then I appreciate the efforts in the U.S., especially with like NFPA Foundation, SFP Research Foundation. I've heard you are always dedicating a lot of money to research in their institutes, which is also amazing. So I hope with more entities like that and more funding bodies that align engineering with science, there's a bright future. Actually, for SFP, I must give them a shout out. There's the Global Challenges Summit coming soon in like two months. And that's a virtual event in which it will be discussed. What are the summits to be ascended? Where should we go with engineering? And researchers can submit their grants to research, get some money for research. Actually, I'm afraid that already is closed, but there will be next rounds, I'm sure. And companies are paying for that. So it creates this beautiful link between science and engineering where both suddenly do gain from that. And I think that's a beautiful cooperation. That's something I would love to promote. Yeah, definitely And I think that's a beautiful cooperation. That's something I would love to promote. Yeah, definitely. I think that's cool that I would be interested in that just to hear to me, I think as a professional, being aware of trends and being aware of where the industry is heading is crucial. I mean, I can speak in the U.S. There has been a huge kind of upset with foam fire suppression recently and regulation changes about AFFF and the kind of incident record around hangar fires has led the industry to reevaluate some of these fire suppression systems. And I've been aware of these grumblings in the community for a year or two. And then all of a sudden, this legislation is popping up fast. And so having a knowledge about these trends and these large macro features of our industry and where it's going is very important because the more knowledgeable you are, the quicker you're going to be able to react to as a professional to where this is going. I also had a question I really wanted to ask you and that's going to be a careful. There's a code in Fire Code Tech and I know you often refer to code compliance, reading codes and actually I'm amazed how you pop up these section numbers from your mind for me. That's crazy in codes. But in some aspects, you know, this fire science and fire engineering, there has been a third branch, which is probably as old as the other ones. The fire codes and how this environment is built. And as crossing, you know, the boundary between science and engineering, it seems that's doable because you need to break someone's comfort zone, hopefully not break low, but you can jump from one to another. But now to jump from science to codes, well, that's a hell of a jump. Did you... Yeah. You had people who are code makers, you had people who are so active in like an FPA and then. Yeah. ICC is the other institution. But yeah, I think that's a great point. I mean, the wheels of code grind slow. I always like to think about, as we think about September 11th and what that did for the fire codes. I mean, some of those impacts and effects we didn't see until maybe 10, 15 years later in the code. And so we have new pieces of fire and life safety equipment like the bidirectional amplifiers in buildings or emergency radio coverage systems. And so we see these changes lagging in the industry. So I think that with any change we're going to see, it's going to have anywhere from a five to a 15 year lag, especially code in the States works from the coasts in. So in a lot of ways or think of it more of from very large and progressive cities and then into the more rural and remote. So it kind of filters in and I think about it in that way. state to bridge that gap in policy or in code enforcement diffusion of these ideas of these policies that takes time to permeate the different communities and cities and states and authorities. So there is this momentum, momentum, I don't want to say against change, but it takes a higher application to get it through. I mean, you just want to talk about getting a new technology listed with a listing agency. I mean, there's so many barriers to entry. Assume that you have a standard. Assume that there's even a standard to test your technology through. You know, there may not be. You may have to create a new standard with the UL and get that tested and put it, finally, once it gets into the codes, you know, you've spent, oh, whatever, anywhere from a couple, 10,000, you know, 10, 20, $30,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars to get your technology into the code. So it's a barrier to entry. It's a barrier to innovation at times, but we deal with lives and fire safety here. So it's a complicated equation. I love this barrier to innovation. If I remember correctly, in 1925, building code in the U.S., there was this that the goals should be performance as often as they can. So the technology is not limited or the growth is not limited by the technology that's prescribed. And that was like already 100 years ago in the code. And I don't think it went that way. I'll find that code. Maybe I'll pop it in the show notes. I'm horribly looking for my head. Yeah, that's remarkable to even think about. You know, like the codes in the U.S. haven't even been the same in the last 20 years, 30 years. We used to have a couple different regional building codes in the U.S. And only in the last three decades have we consolidated into like a uniform set of codes through the ICC. through the ICC. And regionally, there are some states even that don't even follow those kind of same code enforcement procedures. So it really varies wildly in the US. And it's not been that way for very long. In my lifetime, it has been different on a regional level. So it's pretty wild to think about. We're a very, very young industry, honestly. To jump back to the mindset of a young engineer who's entering the profession, this beast of codes doesn't make their work easier or harder. On one hand, you can learn the codes and that's it. You can design. On the other hand, if you limit yourself to codes itself, you lose the wider picture yeah like when you were professionally educated in us was there some focus on having both there was uh like you said earlier your education is really just like a broad base of everything and so in my mind there we're like the program i graduated was technology-focused. It's a technology program, so it's really more on application. If you were to go to a program like the Maryland program or the Worcester Polytech program, they are more fire science-oriented. So they would be more performance-based, more fire science, more fire phenomena. So in school, I experienced more technical application, sort of training and knowledge, which is great because, you know, like getting to wire a smoke detector in school and getting to trip a dry valve in school is that's all meaningful. But of course, you know, there's only so much you can put in a college degree program. But having that experience, I would love to get a, you know, a master's in from like Maryland or one of these programs where they really harp on the fire science, because I think that's like how you get a well-rounded kind of background. For professionals, I see this code base is a huge hindrance on your ability to like perform at a 10-year professional or a 20- have to be knowledgeable because when something new pops up, the 30-year professional has no more background than you do. So you can become the SME on it, and that's how you can give yourself a leg up. Something like that happens now in the fire science with the AI, where the AI is a new interesting thing. And it was a theme in my podcast. I had some interviews about that. And from it emerges a view that it's a new fantastic technology and it really shrinks the distance between you and the ones who have 30 years of experience because both you and them have to learn the new tool and amazing discoveries that can be done with them are available to everyone. And back to your background, actually, you would be surprised how many fire scientists would never know what's the difference between an optical or ionization smoke detector or how does a sprinkler valve work and what's the machinery behind it. And I think this knowledge is also critical for fire researchers. I would somehow assume my audience is more fire research side. I have a lot of fire engineers listening to this. But I think the fire researchers need to be exposed more to how truly buildings work, how safety is delivered, what are the elements of the puzzle that go into protecting their lives in the building. Because if you don't know and you just assume, you make mistakes that may impact the conclusions of your research. They will not change how the smoke flows in your experiment, but they will change the way how you can interpret the outcome of that experiment and what will it do to the building. And there's a lot of people who would overestimate the potential impact, like people figuring out a new clever way to do something. They will say, okay, this is groundbreaking, this will change the world. But no, first you have to validate that. Second, you have to mass produce that. You have to put it in the codes or find a performance-based route to validate that. Second, you have to mass produce that. You have to put it in the codes or find a performance-based route to implement that. I mean, I've done some discoveries, and boy, discovering is the easy part. It's so hard to get your new idea or technology through. I think that's a great point. Like, I was talking to somebody the other day, and I was like, great ideas are a dime a dozen. And I can tell you a thousand good ideas, but like the ability to push it through and to implement it and to bring it into life is really the truly remarkable thing. I think about it a lot because how many ideas have you had in the shower thinking about, you know, something that you found remarkable and it comes to you like a eureka moment, and you're like, oh my gosh, here's a million-dollar idea I just thought of, and then what is that worth? It floats out of your brain and it's gone. Yeah, you have to do notes, man. You have to take notes. That's the trick. You take notes, take notes all the time, take notes. That's good. That's really good. Now, for the last part of the show, I wanted to take this chance of us being here together to brainstorm something. Like, how can we serve audiences better? How can we make the world of fire engineering in a whole better? How to better connect these worlds of fire science and fire engineering. And for me, I think it would be great to have more fire engineers in my show to understand where their pain points are located and maybe try to find scientific answers for them. This could be a nice pathway. What do you think? Yeah, I think that more cross pollination in general, I mean, where I would go with it, I want more people to be talking and more people to be coming on podcasts and really having these discussions and trying to further the total scope and progress of our industry by just having more conversations and putting out more content. I mean, I look at an industry like software development and I see an organization like Free Code Camp and they put out dozens of hours of content on different programming methods and means and it's all for free and they have leaders in the industry come and speak about how to learn and how to develop and issues in the industry and dive into specific topics for hours on end and make it so easy that somebody who is in high school or middle school can pick it up and learn from it. And that's something that I really aspire for our industry to try to bring to the table. really aspire for our industry to try to bring to the table. I think that we just need to make it more accessible, make it more detailed, make more of it. You know, I don't think that, you know, there's dozens of podcasts in fire and life safety, and I still just think that we've only just begun. So that's my thoughts on it. i just hope to keep furthering that discussion and building a community of not only people who are ingesting the content but creating the content yeah there's so so many good resources in the field of podcasting and i think with this field uh the more there is the better because there is no point of saturation. If there's anyone listening to us who would like to join the club, well, there's three spots here. We can coach you through. The only thing holding you back is you. That's so cool, man. I also think with Farkota having this significant flair in personal development and career, I feel this is a theme in your show, where you really go through how someone got to the point where they are. I would really love to hear stories of scientists who went engineering, engineers who went scientists, and preferably scientists who went engineering and then came back to science. That would be a story I would love the most, because I think these people building their careers, building their experiences have really touched both worlds. And in an experiment, they've experienced what it means to lack scientific background for engineering and lack engineering goal for science, right? Oh, yeah. Well, I can tell you, I can't say any with the triple jump where they started academic and then they went engineering and then went academic. But I can tell you career fire protection engineer to academic and, you know, career academic to fire protection engineer. And I will tell you that the professionals who have experience in both are some of the most impactful and most inspiring that I've ever had a chance to work with. And the reason why I'm a fire protection engineer today is because I had a fire protection engineer who is a teacher at the school that I went to. And there were a couple, but one in particular, she worked in Clark County, which is in where Las Vegas is. So on these huge high rise buildings and the blend of competency for research and like the progression of the field, as well as the functional knowledge of how codes and standards work and the science of how to implement these systems really gave me a big eye-opener on how neat this field is. And that really was a big motivating factor for me. And then on the other side, at FSB, I worked with several PhDs who came from academia. And when I would go to them with questions about how a system would work, and they would, structural engineers who would diagram out in hand, beautiful handwritten sketches. You know, obviously you could tell that they had taught a class before. Z would just go through. No, I don't know if you understand this point specifically and would draw it out, the actual connection detail for something we were looking at, how special those moments were in my life and how it's changed, you know, what I do now. It can't be understated. So I think that cross-pollination of this academic and professional or fire protection engineering, rather, is a beautiful thing. Yeah, for me, it's also an important aspect, this, like, having this inclusive. I'm very happy to have everyone in the show, no matter who you are, if you're a professor, if you're just a student, where do you live, doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter. If we can together bring the fire science a little closer to engineering, you're very, very welcome. And I would love everyone to feel like that and yeah that's also important to me because there's enough barriers between us to build even more yeah yeah I think that for me honestly it's just like any time where I've tried to be like to bring people to the table and to really hear people's voice and to get input from others, it's always made my situation better. So that's why the podcast and just trying to build mentorship and different kind of community relationships has been such a theme for me because it's been so rewarding. I think that I'm geared for it by my personal nature, but I also think that at every step of the way, I've just had dividends paid into my life from speaking with people and trying to learn and trying to grow. So that's why you see it as a theme in the podcast is just because I've received a lot from it myself. Man, that's so cool. I'm really happy we got to do this and I hope there's many members of FireSense show audience that will jump in with curiosity to FireSense and learn about all of these interesting career paths and engineering aspects of dealing with fire. Highly recommended. Yeah, yeah. And I'd say for my listeners, if you want to, you want to hear somebody speak, first of all, I mean, I can't get over Wojciech's voice. I mean, it's so silky and smooth. I think he's got a way better podcast voice than me. But so if that's not enough of a factor just to drive you over to the fire science show, I'll give you one more, which is you get to talk to some really passionate and really hyper intelligent individuals about individuals about the, oftentimes, like you said, we don't get the science piece of behind technology or behind the progression of fields. But it's really interesting for me to hear, like, you talk with Guillermo or you speak with Brian Meacham, like we talked about before the episode started, you know, these people who are just they love what they do you know talk about a fire that's been burning for thousands of years and just you know hear him light up inside i mean to me that passion and speaking with people about giving you a broader perspective for fire and life safety is it's so cool and i find huge value in that and i'm a fan of yours. And we talked for the first time on the podcast, hasn't even been a year ago now. Hasn't even been a year. What a crazy year. Well, Gus, all the best for your developments in fire code tech. And I have a feeling we'll meet somewhere in here, not that far away from now. I like this idea of crossing episodes, so maybe we should do one more, maybe on smoke control. I would love to smoke control one. Come down. Come down. We need to do it. We'll meet again. This is not goodbye for sure. Thanks so much for now, and to everyone listening to this special episode of Fire Science Go Tech Show, thank you. Hey, thank you guys. And don't forget to go subscribe. If you like what you're listening to, subscribe to both. Hit the bell on both. They're both good shows. I'm sure there'll be some that you like of both of them. And yeah, thank you guys so much for listening. It's been fun. And I hope you enjoyed. Thank you. And that's it. Thank you for listening. I hope you liked it. As you're here in the podcast app, you probably want to try out FireCode. And see what Gus has to offer. After two years of podcasting, there's a really great repository of episodes there. And if you look carefully, you can find one with myself as well. I hope that's a good one. I think it was. Anyway, I think all that has been said has been said. And my further commentary on this episode is unnecessary. I would like to just take this freestyle chance to thank Gus again for what he's doing for the fire profession. It's a pleasure to watch him and his show grow, develop as engineer so gus great job you're doing there keep podcasting man and i hope we'll do this once more soon it was it was really fun to to take over your audience and share my audience with you so thanks gus and to all you listening, next Wednesday, next episode, so make sure you come here. And for FireCodeTech, the episodes are on Monday. One week it's interview format and other week it is solo cast format where Gus just discusses some interesting aspects of codes and technology in fire safety engineering. So an interesting twist in podcasting. I like it very much and I hope you do as well. Anyway, that is it. Thank you very much for being here and see you around. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
