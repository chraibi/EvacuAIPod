 Okay, so let's start this session with a little thought experiment. Imagine that you have a compartment, a fairly large compartment, in which you have one megawatt fire. And the data point I can give you is that the average temperature of your smoke will be 150 degrees. Then, if you had two megawatts of fire in that room, the temperature would be 300. So if I asked you what would be your guess if the fire was 1.5 megawatt, well, there's a good chance you could interpolate that to some value like 225 or something. But based on these two data points, you could probably make out a reasonable assumption of what the temperature would be at a slightly different fire. However, let's imagine that the case becomes a little bit more complex. There are windows at the top of the building that will break if the temperature reaches a certain value. And there's more than one door to the room. So depending on how many you open, your air velocity will change. The room is naturally ventilated to make it more complex. So if the windows broke or not will significantly change the behavior of your smoke control system. In this case, our simple compartment has changed into quite a difficult-to-predict system, which will be very, very highly related to the size of the fire in it. And the output of the analysis will definitely change unlinearly with the heat release rate. It will be very difficult to predict. And this is why research, as done by Professor Xinyuan Huang, who is my today's guest, is so valuable to the fire community. This is why the new technologies such as machine learning and AI are becoming more and more impactful in fire science. in fire science because we as humans, we get lost when there's too many variables or they change in a nonlinear fashion. I mean, we're decent at predicting an outcome from a set of limited scenarios. But once things get complicated, that's very difficult to give a reasonable prediction. And on the other hand, the computers, well, they can learn without any limits. They can take whatever number of variables you want to teach them. They can remember for years as long as their database is working. So they definitely can cover some things that we as engineers cannot. And in today's episode, you're going to learn a lot more on AI from Sinian. A necessary disclaimer is that neither me nor Sinian are AI scientists, so we're not really the people who you should quote on the development of AI technology or the choice of the AI algorithms. There are proper AI scientists. However, both me and Sinian, we're good at applying tools to our research. and we're good at applying tools to our research. And I think the application of AI that Sinian proposes is very powerful and very useful. So I hope I've built up your curiosity for this episode. It's going to be a great one. So, yeah, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski, and I will be your host. Okay, everyone, welcome to session number seven of the Fire Science Show. I'm here today with Dr. Sinian Huang from Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Hi, Washington. Hello, man. Great to have you here. Sinian is a talented young scientist, even though he's early in his career. That's one hell of a scientific career. He's been doing his PhD in Imperial College London. He's done his postdoc at University of California, Berkeley, and now is back to Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Started researching small ring fires, done some combustion and some fires in microgravity. Now touching the subject of smart firefighting. So that's an interesting pathway. Can you tell us a bit more? How did you start and where did you end up? Sure. So I think I started with a career path to be a combustion scientist. But somehow I changed my research area to more fire related. But still, I'm trying to do more fundamental aspect of the fire research. But later on when I become professor and start to teach the young engineers, I feel like I have to learn more about the applied aspect of the fire safety. So I'm trying to do some more research related to the industry as well as building fire safety, rather than just focusing on the combustion aspect. And the reason I'm doing the smart firefighting is, in fact, around my PhD period in 2015, that time, AI and big data is really a big topic. And almost every discipline is using new tools, new AI tools and database to reshaping their research methods. But our FHIR community seems to be relatively slow. We are not really using these new tools, but I think they are very promising and have a great potential to help. Like we do the file engineering design as well as file fighting to save the lives. So that's the reason. And also we are very lucky. We got good funding support from the Hong Kong government to support us to do these new AI-based Smart5 ID. It's also a theme that came to my attention. And it's like, no, you don't have to be rocket scientists to figure out the AI. Maybe a new opening for all scientists. Well, you are kind of a rocket scientist in a way. So that's maybe never even even easier for yourself um because the ai will be the the theme of this discussion and the theme of this this podcast episode and could you please uh tell a bit more to the listeners um how does the ai work and and why is everyone so hot about using it, applying it to their fields of science? What does it give that we cannot do today? Okay, so first I have to confess I'm not really an AI expert. In fact, I have never really programmed anything using AI. Okay. But my students, they are using these AI technologies. They do some codings. But I have to say even for them, they are not really editing the AI algorithm. They are simply using the AI algorithm. So I like to make a comparison with CFD code using file engineering. Almost every file engineer, file scientist, we use CFD code to simulate a file. We use that often, but we don't program these CFD solvers. Even someone writes the code, they're probably just editing some input rather than writing codes to solving these partial differential equations. It's not really our jobs. And actually, it's quite mature already. People in 1970s, 80s, they have already developed very mature code to solve these now with stock equations and all the other differential equations. So I think in the AI area, similar things is happening. So the computer scientists, the mathematicians, they have developed these powerful tools, AI tools, these packages, and you can actually download it from the website. These packages are already there. They are very powerful. There are different kinds of packages like CNN, STM, all these different kinds of algorithms to help you solve the problem. You just need to pick up the right one, the best one, easiest one for you to solve your specific problem. So for fire engineers and fire scientists, I think we can treat the AI just like a CFD tool in a certain way. We need to learn how to use it, but we don't have to learn how to program it because it's already quite mature. Yeah, that's powerful. From one of your talks, I captured that you said that AI is today where CFD was 30 years ago. And that's a powerful statement that it definitely can be an emerging field that will transform the industry. From my perspective, when I discuss AI or capabilities of that with other people who don't necessarily understand what's, because, you know, it's kind of a black box now. And it's like whenever there's an interesting piece of science, what did you do? I've dropped machine learning on it. And then that means like it is very hard to understand what has been actually done. And when I was trying to understand how AI could work, I figured out that when you observe things, when you do experiments, when you learn new things from experiments, you start to get these correlations, like if the fire is bigger, the temperature will be bigger, yeah? But as humans, we are limited to maybe three, four variables that we can comprehend at the same time, and we're rather good at linear correlations, but very, very bad at hyperbolic trends, for example. And it's like, as a human, it's very difficult to predict if something is going like hyperbolic trend. And in fire, we have many of these things, like visibility in smoke, for example. So to my understanding, so when we're thinking about how human thinks, there are two types of thinking. One is like intuition. It's more like a pattern matching. So we're not really using logic. The other kind of thinking is like logical thinking. So you just mentioned like for us, it's maybe three to five parameters maximum we can think logically. We can try to find the physical relationship between them. But actually our brains are really powerful. We have all these kinds of sensors, ears and eyes, all these sensors. We have a lot of information stored in our brain. And we have the intuition to do the pattern matching to get new ideas. So I'm just thinking about why do smart firefighting? Why using AI to do it? Because we want to train the AI to act like a very experienced firefighter. We always hear these kind of stories. Some experienced firefighters, they went to the fire scenes and they are like six cents tells them, okay, something is going to happen. Something bad is going to happen. We shouldn't enter the fire scene anymore. We should just get out. So like a few seconds after they get out, there is like big explosion or the building is collapsed. So they have these kind of sense. These sense is not logical thinking rather than the pattern matching because they have been fighting like hundreds of thousands of fires. They absorb this information but they cannot reasonize it. So if we can train the computer, if we can feed so much data to the computer, to the AI engine to make them like experienced firefighters, then we can pass this information to the firefighter in the real file scene to help them to make a decision to alert them of potential fire danger. And then you have firefighters in Hong Kong that you were working with, and on the other side of the bay, the firefighters in Macau have no idea about your experiences, and you don't have any idea of their experiences. And with the AI and data, you can actually merge them and share these experiences in the most powerful way. Exactly. So actually for our project, we are working very closely with the fire service department in Hong Kong. And we constantly meeting with some of these retired firefighters. They have shared a lot of stories about some unusual things and some of their personal special thinking about the fire. And we're trying to add these experiences into the code to help train the AI model. But of course, it's a very long way to go. We are still in the early stage. But hopefully we can, our AI engine eventually can be very smart based on all these experiences. My own firefighting experience is very, very limited, if I can even say that I have any. But from the laboratory perspective, we're doing some similar things. Well, we're not extinguishing fires, we're setting things on fire, and we're observing how they burn. And especially my colleagues that specialize in one type of the of the tests their predictive algorithms in their heads are very very very well working and they by by taking a look at the course of the of the early stage of the fire test they can already with a quite good confidence figure out when the sample will fail or what will happen. There's a biological machine learning and that's the intuition that you have mentioned. Yes, we have jokes with these firefighter friends. I always say you guys are really good at stopping a fire, but we are really good at starting a fire. We start a fire all the time in the lab. I mean, if I pursued the career of arsonist, I predict I would be a successful arsonist now. Yeah, all the fire researcher would be. In your research, you also mentioned this Internet of Things or distributed networks of sensors. There's also a second thing that must be cleared. So what do you mean by Internet of Things sensors? So in order to have a complete smart firefighting system, having a big database, having a strong AI engine is just one component. For real fire, we need sensors to gather data from that fire. Sometimes it's very difficult because most of the fire will be covered by dark and heavy smoke. So it's quite difficult for firefighters, even firefighters inside the building, identify the fire location or other potential and danger places. So we definitely need these sensors installed inside the building, pre-installed, best pre-installed in the building. And if we cannot have these sensors pre-installed, potentially during the firefighting process, we may have UAVs or firefighters can carry some of the sensors into the fire scenes that can gather some information. But in general, if the building is already equipped with these sensors network, then especially like temperature sensor, like video, CCTV cameras, all these are very useful information to support fire fighting. So with this network of sensors, you mean the means to collect the data from the building as the fire develops, grows? Because I understand that the knowledge of the firefighter is limited to what does they see and what does their colleagues see, because in the remote parts of the building where no one is at the moment, you have no idea what's happening. So definitely it gives you like this three-dimensional view over the building. So the array of the sensors would be the eyes and the ears of the firefighter. The AI would be, let's say, the second brain of the firefighter. And you process the data and how would it contribute to the firefighting once this data is processed and available? That's a very important question. Many firefighters mentioned that during the firefighting process, on one hand, they need a lot of information. But on the other hand, they don't want so much irrelevant information. They are actually gathering too much information about people running out from the fire scene and all the smoke and new fires. All these are information. But they actually need some kind of other information more valuable to their current activity. So on one hand, we don't want to give too much information to the firefighters. activity. So on one hand, we don't want to give too much information to the firefighters. On the other hand, we want to give like only valuable information for them and also to the fire commanders. So I think one thing we can do is if we have the sensor network, for example, like temperature sensor, I think it's most important because temperature can reflect the fire information probably the best way. And we will run like thousands of CFD simulations and maybe a lot of experiments. And we build a database. So once some temperature sensor gets some data, they will search the database. And then they will find the best match of the fire scenario. Then the AI engine will pass that scenario to the fire command center. So the fire commanders will know in the computer screen what kind of fire inside is built. And that's one level of information. The other level is the AI should be able to predict critical events, not just general events. not just general events. We're talking about critical events like flashover, like explosion, like potential window break or these structure collapse. And these critical information should be passed to the firefighter in the fire scene. We don't want to give additional not so valuable information to them. These are two levels. We want to give more information to the commanders, but we only want to pass the critical information to the firefighters. This might be a little silly story, but in my years of World of Warcraft career, I was a raid leader, and I was commanding a group of 25 people battling together in the video game. And also, I was was receiving unbelievable amount of information that i had to process to take decisions on the spot and i actually faced that issue what you mentioned about being overwhelmed with irrelevant information and we've actually spent hours and hours of our time designing the user interface a custom custom user interface. So I only received the information that is necessary to take decisions and in appropriate time when the decision must be taken and everything else is muted or hidden. And that's when we were the most efficient. So when you say these things that you don't want to have the commanders overwhelmed with irrelevant information, that's absolutely fantastic because I think that's exactly what they need. I mean, they don't need a red light flashing that there's a fire in the building because they know that already. If you could truly predict the events in the fire, like flashover, backdraft, that could actually be very beneficial because a warning that conditions for backdraft are occurring, even life-saving information. That's really interesting. discussions with firefighters, from my experience with the firefighters, it's not necessarily these, let's say, usual fires that are the most difficult, you know. If they have a path of ventilation secured, if they know that the fire is in like one compartment, if they know there are no people inside, it's obviously, it's always a fire and it can develop in different ways. But it's the usual conditions. They are trained to work in. But there are these things that in a way are unpredictable. And I mean like meteorological conditions. I mean, sometimes the wind direction can change and completely change the direction of the flows inside of the building. Sometimes you may have opening, like doors or window break at the different level of the building that will change the location of the neutral pressure plane in the building. Sometimes they have to take decisions if they want to introduce the positive pressure ventilation on an opening or not, because they don't, they have to judge by looking. They judge by looking and intuition, they do not judge by knowing and solving, you know, it's an intuitive decision. So I think from this perspective, especially related to the flow path in the building, which is very complex to analyze. Me as a CFD engineer with like 12 years of experience doing that, I considered it a difficult subject and there's so many variables that affect the flow path in the building from outdoors to indoor conditions and heights, pressures, everything. It's difficult to predict. So I think this AI could be extremely powerful in supporting these decisions, right? Yes, but the AI is only as powerful as its database. So if we have a big database like thousands of these CFD simulations, and if everyone in the world, all the fire engineers can contribute together to the database, then it will be very powerful. The problem right now is engineers don't have the habit to share data. Maybe that's before the big data age. Right now we are entering the big data age. Right now, we are entering the big data age. In fact, all these data are really valuable. And with a large database, then the AI can recognize all unexpected things. Otherwise, AI can never reach the level of human. But on the other hand, I think the AI part, the big data data part is still relatively easy. I mean, researchers can help to improving the algorithm, to increasing the database size. But I think the most challenging part is the industry. To install these sensors to the buildings, it's really hard to change some paradigm or change the regulations, especially if we want to add additional sensors to the buildings. It's really difficult to convince like current contractor or even the government regulators to support us. So when I was an undergraduate student like 15 years ago, we were talking about like green buildings, like zero carbon emission buildings, new energy building at that time. At the time, smart building is not a popular word yet. So green building is more popular. So many professors are doing these energy saving, like smart HVAC system, building automation system. Like they can use sensors to help manage the building energy better, save the HVAC energy. Like if the room is, nobody's inside, you can turn off the air conditioner. So that's really kind of smart system can use to save energies. So unfortunately, like after like 15 years, all these technologies are very mature right now almost no building are using this kind of system so one day i was asking our campus development development office so i asked them so is there any building in our campus especially these new buildings recently built buildings are they using these smart energy-saving systems, building information systems? Then they checked. They said, no, we haven't used that. I said, why not? We actually have so many professors doing this kind of research. Why can't we just use these technologies in our own building? Then they said, okay, it's difficult. We cannot add additional sensors, and it's difficult to buy these additional systems. But I think things are getting changed now. Now, like Hong Kong government are supporting new buildings to install these energy-saving and building formation systems. But still a very long way to go. building formation system. But still very long way to go. Even in the energy area, it's so difficult to add these sensors to add some smart system. So I will feel for the firefighting, especially consider fire as a real event. So it's more difficult to install additional sensors to the buildings. Maybe we can start from high-value infrastructure like underwater tunnels, high-end museums. So these may be the potential buildings to first install some smart firefighting system, not as a regular building. I think that we have two parallel things happening with fire systems. One is the development of the traditional, let's say, fire detection systems and building management systems, which from my perspective, they are already very, very advanced. We have these building management systems that can read the values from the individual sensors. They can show them real-time on the building management system screen. The sensors that we are using in the buildings, in high-end buildings, can be multi-detector, like heat and visibility. So on the fire side, the technology probably already exists, and I would risk saying that any sensors any sensor that you could use is already on the market yes on the other hand you have these sensors as a part of a very like sterile fire alarm system you are not allowed to play that much with the fire alarm system because its purpose is to indicate the fire alarm. So it's the primary objective. And sometimes to have this primary objective fulfilled, you're not allowed to fiddle with the system. You're not allowed to export data. Actually, data export could be possibly doable. But then again, because of the way how these systems are created for their reliability, it may be difficult to synchronize the time of the sensors when you have thousands of them. Exactly. And because we're talking about fire and the sensors are meant to detect the fire, not survive the fire, they will start eventually dying out. So these fire sensors, I mean, that's a potential direction because, as you mentioned, it's difficult to add additional sensors. You would like to work with what's already existing. Yes. So I would feel like current heat sensors, most of the current heat sensors, they have like thermocouples temperature sensor inside. The data is there, but we are not using that data. We only use like file detection. We are not exporting the temperature data, but the data is already there. Same applies to the HVAC system. So like in my room, there is a temperature panel. It shows the temperature in that room because there is a sensor there. But these kind of information are not really collected by the central intelligence system because it's more expensive. But if we can collect them, it's already a temperature sensor in every room that can significantly help we identify the fire scenario. Even these sensors may only last five to ten minutes in a big fire, but still very valuable, this information. Well, the fact that the sensor died is an information itself as well. This means that maybe by developing this brain of the system, having, let's say, algorithms worked out how to determine a fire scenario based on available data and how to match it with what the database has. with what the database has, at some point it would be able to merge these two worlds together and just add the AI component into a building management system. And then it suddenly becomes very simple because if the AI is trained to work with the data collected from the building sensors and there's a building management system that collects that, you only need a processor and then you need an output interface that will pass it further. So that's a good direction, I think. Yes, if the building already have a centralized building information system, it's much easier for us to upgrade it coupled with a smart file fighting system. But the first step is quite difficult. Only limited building has this kind of building information system. From the added value of the sensors, because I'm researching wind and fire so much, for me the first thing I would add would be a very good weather station on the building to truly know the weather conditions at the moment in the building proximity. Because the fact that you know the wind like five kilometers away on an airport or wherever your nearest metro station is located, that does not necessarily reflect the conditions you will have at the particular location of the building. So maybe we should equip fire trucks with weather balloons that would be released nearby. That actually could work. I think the technology is there, but it's difficult to convince everyone to install in their building. Yeah. You've mentioned that there are these high value buildings like underwater tunnels, museums, where this could really shine. In this types of buildings, we are already investing significant amount of money to provide safety. We don't only mean the occupant safety or, you know, the fact that no one will die and the building will not collapse. No, we want this infrastructure to survive the fire and be able to be used after the fires very quickly. So these buildings are usually equipped with top-notch technology. For example, in tunnels, we often have linear heat detectors, depending on, obviously, on the type of the heat detector. But there are these types of heat detectors that have a temperature measuring point every five meters. detectors that have a temperature measuring point every five meters. So that's a resolution that's actually quite amazing and allows you to work out a lot of data. And I think you have used something like that in one of your papers where you've tried to identify the location of the fire based on temperature measurements. Can you give some backdoor information? How are you seeking the fire and identifying it with AI based on these measurements? Thanks for bringing that up. So for this file, smart firefighting concept and project, we have to start with some kind of building. So eventually we pick up the tunnel, because comparatively tunnel is relatively simpler. So you have like fire can only move to like linearly from left to right. But I'm not saying tunnel fire is simple. It's just relatively simple. It's still very complicated. So we see like many tunnel fires you have a lot of smoke coming out from the inlet to end so it's basically impossible for you to identify where is the fire and what kind of vehicle is burning so once it's covered by heavy smoke. So I think that's a big motivation for us to try if we can use the tunnel as a demonstration for the smart firefighting system. So what do we do is we have something done and also something ongoing. So first we try the CFD simulations. We build a database, purely CFD simulation database. Then we have that database. Then we can try. So if we can just train AI with this numerical database, then once it's trained, it can. Using temperature sensor, maybe only every 20 meters. So excuse me. So if you've in your CFD model, you've equipped the CFD model with artificial sensors within the CFD model that were to simulate what would be the equipment of the tunnel if it was real, yes? So we tried one. So we simulate 1,000 different tunnel fire scenarios inside the tunnel. And we're trying to match the scenario with the sensor data. So once we have a new fire and the sensor is recording the temperature data, then these temperature data can do a pattern search by AI engine in our database to identify which is the most closed fire scenario in that invisible space. Then the AI will just pick that up so we can know the size of the fire and the location of the fire. And we're also doing that in our lab. So we have a small tunnel model and we are doing like experiment in this small tunnel. We're building experimental database. And then we're trying to block the tunnel and ask the student to randomly put a fire inside that tunnel and see if our AI model can pick up the fire location exactly. Of course there are some time delays but in general it's very good. You have built it a huge let's say experience with fires in this particular tunnel so it knows how the fighters can look. And what it does, it fits to the closest one in his database that it knows, yes? Exactly. That's pattern matching. That's great, because now you're talking about a single variable, which is the temperature. But you could also eventually build up to, like, velocity, the pressure difference of the portals, the slope of the tunnel. And the beauty with the AI, you can probably like, you can add without an end. It's like, it's always open to add more things, to learn new things, and it will still remember everything from the past. So it's powerful. Yes, but we have to build a database, like pre-built database. So when the fire happens, they can recognize that database. And currently we have some students doing the real-scale tunnel fire in mainland China. So we're trying to install these smart sensors in the real-scale tunnel, test tunnel. I think tunnels are, well, at least the ones that I'm involved with, they are extremely well equipped with sensors because we're actually using a lot of data on the fly to drive the sanitary mode ventilation from the tunnels based on velocity, visibility, temperatures and everything. Because we want to be energy efficient. The tunnels, when you have large traffic in the tunnel, the cars will force the flow through the tunnel. And it can be quite a significant wind created in the tunnel by just the cars driving. So it's usually self-ventilated. You don't want to power the fans all the time because they do noise, they use energy, it's inefficient. So we need to find out when there are pollutants in the tunnel and use them. All these data are really valuable. If the community can share the data and build a big tunnel database, I think it will be really powerful. It can be used to train the AI engine. I definitely see this as a possible direction for future and if only we can get to collaborate on basically sharing the data to build a more powerful version of the database. sharing the data to build a more powerful version of the database. And did you try creating some very difficult scenarios for the AI? Like, I don't know, blocking one exit of the tunnel and see what it will do or maybe placing two fires inside to see how... You will obviously confuse it because it has never seen such a situation. But I wonder how well it can, what will it do? So, yeah, this is a very, very interesting question. Actually, we saw some, like, non-realistic things predicted by our AI. So one of my students is doing some experiment, playing with this AIoT system in our tunnel. So he's trying to move the fire inside the tunnel manually. While recording? Yes. So the sensor is recording the moving of the fire. Then the AI is not recognizing the moving of the fire. Then the AI is not recognizing the moving of the fire. Instead, the AI is seeing there are three and four fires next to each other. Because the temperature sensor is not cooling down yet. So actually the sensor still thinks there is a fire there. Not that the fire isn't already moving to another direction. Of course, I guess if we train if we have more data, the engine could be smarter. Right now, it's giving some non-realistic thing. I wanted to ask that because it's also not a magical tool. It is a tool, and that's it. And to use a tool, you need to know its limitations. If you want a screw, I mean, you can do it with a hammer, but it's not the way you should. So that was one of the papers I've read. The other one, also very interesting, was in the atrium smoke control systems. And I think then you've used a slightly different approach because you've shown it the images of the smoke inside the atrium. Can you also like introduce us to that research item? Yes. So this is another research related to the AI. And I personally think that's more promising in a certain way. Especially when I'm thinking about install IoT system, all these sensors in the building is so difficult, such a long way to go to change the current building regulations. So instead, I think AI is more valuable in file engineering design. Just like using the CFD nowadays, all the consulting companies are using CFD for the fire engineering design. So I think using AI to do fire engineering design will be the future and it will happen really quickly in the next five years. Because we can treat AI as a tool, just like CFD. But it's much powerful. It's much faster. The prediction is like within a second because it's already pre-trained. It recognizes a pattern instantaneously. But of course, it requires you to build a strong and a big database to achieve that kind of predictions. And also I see, of course, I'm also in the government panels to evaluate the fire engineering design, the performance-based fire engineering design for some buildings. I sometimes see these consulting companies are showing some CFD results quite questionable. the result quite questionable. I'm sure they only show us some specific case that can pass the regulation. They are hiding some cases which will not pass the standard. I have to say this process is not very transparent. It's difficult for authorities to evaluate their result. It's also for authorities to evaluate their result. It's also very time consuming for these consulting companies to run these simulations. Sometimes these simulations can last for days and get not even good results. So it's kind of like a waste of time. kind of like a waste of time. So if we have a strong AI tool, it can help the design company to fund the optimal design. And it can also help the authority to identify whether these proposed designs are reasonable or not, if the consulting companies are cheating the system. So I think that probably will be more popular, more promising than the smart firefighting system because firefighting is very challenging. When we're considering fire, we'll change with time. Like every second, it will be very different. So you have a time variable there. But the design, actually, you don't need to do real time. I'm in trouble now because I wanted to go deeper into the atrium, but you have also mentioned something very, very interesting. I think I'll ask you about the interesting thing first, and then we'll come back to the atrium because there's one more thing I need to hear about that one. I need to hear about that one. So in one of the talks, you've said that you've commented on the speed of AI versus the CFD. And you've said that the AI is faster because the most time-consuming work has already been done in the past. And that's building the database. And that is something you are not able to do if you want to solve a CFD case on the fly for a building. So if you can tell us, because that's the quickly search through an archive of results that you have to find the case that most fits your particular case, right? And take decisions based on that. While CFD would be like a deterministic way to solve the current physics in the building and figure out what happens. physics in the building and figure out what happens. And the issue is you can use the archive to at least see where you are and what are the possible outcomes. Well, you're not able to use the CFD to do the same because it's too slow. Can you just tell me what's your experiences in that? We start with HM5 because that's probably the most popular performance-based design cases. So most of the cases involve large volume. You're usually exceeding the regulation. You have to do CFD simulation to prove you have enough asset for people to evacuate. You mean available safe evacuation time, Yes, yes. So, we do the hard work before in during the database. So for example, when we design a specific case in our paper, we run about 2000 CFD simulation or different atrium size, atrium height, fire size, as well as smoke ventilation capability. Also the smoke visibility and sooty years from the fires. All these will change the value of evacuation time, available evacuation time. So we build that database. Of course, that time is very consuming. But once we build it, everything becomes easier. Once the database is there and AI is used to train with this database, then what we can do is much easier. We can identify the limiting condition. So, for example, if I want evacuation time ASAP to be 20 minutes, then the AI can tell you what's the maximum fire you can have, what's the maximum atrium height you can have. So it actually helps you to do the design. Conventionally, when we do the design, we run the CFT code. Okay, we set a specific fire. We set a specific smoke ventilation capability, then we run simulation. That simulation may take two days. Then you get one data, and you don't even know that data is passing the code or not. If it's not, then you run another one, you run another one. Probably you run 10, 20 is maximum. It's still very difficult for you to find the optimal value concerning so many variables, file size, atrium size, and also ventilation design. So the AI can actually identify that limit condition within a second if it's well trained. I'm in a very lucky position in my institute. We have access to our own supercomputer. It's not a huge supercomputer. It has 200 cores, which is, let's say, large for our needs, but not impressive anyway in the world list of biggest computers. It would place behind probably gaming consoles of new generation. Anyway, if we use Ansys Fluent to solve the cases, which is a solver that has very powerful scalability of the computation time with number of processes involved, it's very efficient in that way. in which you are solving for a time-average flow, not momentary flow like you would have in LES simulations. Combining this solver with these particular settings moderately costs for buildings, for normal buildings, like let's say a shop with let's say 1,000 square meters of the floor area, we are reaching something like real-time CFD, which means I can run my case and let's say 20 minutes of the simulation time will take me, let's say 20 to 40 minutes of the wall clock time to solve. But that's already a substantial amount of resources used to solve that in this way. And yet I was solving just one case, as you mentioned, that's a single data point. So I think we're somewhat touching the glass ceiling because it's very difficult to push this time even further down because I'm already at the limit of what my single processor can handle. If I make the grid coarser, it will not help because it's not calculation time that is limiting me. It's, for example, the data transfer or data acquisition in general. So there is this glass ceiling that will prevent my calculations from going any faster. If I bought a second computer, a third computer, it would not help me. It would allow me to run the bigger models in a shorter time, but I would have a very difficult time to get it into, let's say, real-time or a predictive mode. So that's my feeling with my computer. And I know you are an FDS user user and you're also using supercomputers. You're running thousands of simulations. What are your feelings in terms of computational time and this? So I'm not saying AI is faster than the CFD because when we build as a database all the CFD, we still need to run thousands of CFD. They are also time consuming. But AI just make your decision making, especially for most of the design cases. You are not interested in one specific case. You are more interested in the limit. What's your design limit? So if you just run one or two maybe ten CFD simulations it can give you some value but it can never give you some limiting case so that's one of the difference and the other thing is I noticed that most of these performance based design are more or less similar, especially for the atrium. It's all large space. The atrium height is very high, so the smoke will accumulate on the top. So most of the fire engineering consulting companies, they do this kind of project. For every new project, they have to rerun all the simulations. So the knowledge is not passed to the next project. So if you can combine all these database, all pre-run simulations into a database, so the database will grow and the AI will learn more. So when the new project comes, you use that trained AI with a database, you can actually give a much better prediction than some junior fire engineer who are not very familiar with the CFD code. I think AI can give much reasonable and reliable result. Because human beings are more likely to make mistakes. So that's the reason in the paper we just written, we compare the AI with a group of fire engineers with different experience. And we noticed that. So we write a survey, like a one-page survey of a specific case. We ask these fire engineers in different companies. First, I ask them to judge whether this fire scenario will pass the regulation. I want them to answer within a minute using their gut, using their intuition. Then I ask them to do the CFD simulation to see if their initial intuitive judgment is correct or not. Then I compare their CFD result with our AI result. It turns out half of the participants' initial CFD calculations are wrong. They all input something wrong in the code, probably by accident. wrong in the code. Probably by accident. So comparatively, AI is more reliable because it won't make a mistake in the input parameters. But human engineers always, sometimes you make some mistake and it's difficult to be detected. I must say, I was about to ask you about this AI versus human battle and I'm not happy that humans are not leading in this one. And what's even worse, I've tried myself against your paper to figure out if I can, based on the data in the paper, what would be my guess about your atrium. And it's not something I want to discuss on the podcast because I didn't do very well against your AI. I want to discuss on the podcast because I didn't do very well against your AI. But it shows that it truly is, once it is well trained, it is a powerful tool in the toolbox. I'm not saying humans are not as good as AI. It's actually the opposite. Humans are always better than AI in creative things so if you are if you give AI a very clear goal it probably will do better than the humans because humans sometimes make mistakes but AI is not creative and it can never be creative as human beings that's something I want to say I'm not trying to criticize the human beings. It's fascinating that you can do this type of comparisons, which makes sense. It all comes down to the experience. We've talked about that when discussing firefighters, and now we've moved to the engineers, but that's the same case. There is some collective experience that engineers have, which is not easily shared between them. Basically, each of the engineers is some of their own experiences. And when they retire, they drop these experiences. It's not being passed forward even if they try to like teach young generation of engineers everything they know it's impossible to just teach this in a way that the others would take it as their own experience yeah it's impossible for students to learn so we have a colleague here who has been working in the industry for 30 years. So in his course, he shared like 30 years of experience of fire engine design to the students. But it's really difficult for students to grasp this kind of knowledge just in the classroom. They actually need training and later doing projects to really understand these knowledges. So the knowledge is not so easy to be passed to the next generation. You've said about this also the simulations being used single time for a particular building and then the knowledge uncovered by this simulation is lost. I remember some years ago we had this discussion in the office that we have done probably a hundred car park CFD projects for a hundred different car parks each having unique geometry, unique conditions, unique systems and back then we were actually discussing in the office I remember that maybe we should just take all of these reports, just look at all of them and figure out if there are any relations between them. Like if we can learn from like looking on the bigger picture of on all everything that was done, but we also very quickly realized it's kind of pointless because it's like we are not able to comprehend. And back then we had not considered AI and big data as a possibility to like find a tool that could do it for us and then help us figure out the relations. Now I see that the tool exists. So maybe we should come back to it. It actually could be very fascinating to learn from real projects. And yeah, that's something to consider. I believe we are really touching the true nature of AI. So AI is, I see it's like non-linear fitting or different parameters. So our human brains maybe do three and five parameters top with logical and physical laws. But AI can do more than that. It can do 20 parameters or even more. It can find the connections between these different parameters, these nonlinear correlations. So that's beyond the human brain. I also love how well it works with images, with visual patterns. It's also something very difficult to process as a human being, because even when you're looking at, for example, the images of smoke, it's difficult to comprehend the values, you know. plot them in a very unfriendly way to colorblind people. And it's difficult to work out what are the values, what are the gradients between places, you know. It's like you just see where the things are, but to really understand the physics or the image or even this aspect that you look at the two-dimensional plane of a building where you plot your results while the flows are three-dimensional. And the only chance that you can figure out what's happening in three dimensions by looking at the two-dimensional picture is if you have experienced a fire simulation, you've seen such an image in your head and you can fit it. But then AI is so much better. I think actually that's something that you've done with the Atrium paper because you were showing it in images of smoke and layer decaying and it was figuring out the three-dimensional features. The last thing, because this AI is as good as the database that it is learned on, and this causes some inherent challenges to the way how AI can be used. We've talked about firefighters. We've talked about building management. Now we've moved into the fire engineers where it truly is something that can shine. What about scientists? How useful this can be to study fire physics or fire phenomenon and do not fall into a trap that you've misunderstood something because the AI database was limited. What's your take? Because you're a scientist and you're most likely using these concepts also to your research. Yes. So from scientific point of view, from fire scientist point of view, sometimes you feel frustrated, like you know all the equations, but AI know nothing can do better. you know all the equations, but AI knows nothing can do better. Maybe in future, some high school student who are familiar with these AI tools, they can predict the fire better than you, although they know nothing about equations. But if we're thinking about the CFDs, then I think it's understandable for most people using CFD to simulate fires. Many of them do not know the fundamental fire dynamics or the equations behind it. And they are still using it almost daily for their job, for the design. Of course, some of the simulation results are quite questionable. So still, I would suggest them to learn the fire science dynamics behind so they can use the tool better and wiser. I think that will apply to AI as well. Eventually, I guess there will be very cool, powerful AI tools to help you do the fire engineering design or in general, any kind of design. But sometimes these predictions could be non-realistic in terms of fire protection. If something happens, it could be catastrophic. So my suggestion is steel. So enjoy the new tool, but still learn the fundamentals. And from like combustion scientist point of view, is it also useful to study, let's say, the physics of a flame? Yes, I believe so. Sometimes the CFD or the AI can give a very strange result. And if you know the physics behind it, you can identify whether these predictions are reasonable or not. You should trust it or not. And you can also judge whose simulation is better. That's powerful. Well, Sinian, thank you for your time and taking us to the world of the future. You said five years. For the designers at least, I hope that will be true because it's something that can improve our work and truly help us focus on the important and creative parts of our work, not repeatable simulations and repeatable work. And in the buildings, it probably will take a bit more time to get the sensors in the place. But once that happens, we will definitely achieve new tools and new ways to make buildings safer and make firefighting safer and more efficient. So that's great. Thank you so much for this talk. Thank you for the invitation. Wow, Kassim, this is absolutely amazing in what he's doing, and I'm a huge fan of his research on AI and application of that into fire science and engineering. He said that we're going to use machine learning tools and AI in fire engineering design within five years. So that's quite an hour of timeline. And I would really love to see how it unravels. The tools mentioned in the discussion seemed really powerful in supporting engineers in their daily tasks. And when Sinan said that you can just ask AI to optimize the fire smoke control system to allow for 20 minutes of safe evacuation time well that's something that would be very very difficult to do as as an engineer with conventional tools like CFD because it would probably take you a lot of time to figure out the optimal point where your systems actually do that. And yet AI can do that in a matter of seconds. So, wow, that's really powerful. And then me, myself, as a smoke control engineer, I can truly see this being a huge aid in the future. It will not replace us. It will not make our job useless. We will still have to fuel the machine with data points. We will still have to create systems. We will still have to be the ones choosing the design, including aspects that AI may never think of, like local law or expectations of your investor. These are the things that would be very difficult to put into the machine. However, used wisely, it can be a very powerful ally, and I'm looking forward to that. I hope you enjoyed this episode, and if you would like to learn a little bit more on AI, I would highly recommend you reading the review paper by Dr. Nasser from Clemson University on the use of AI in fire science. If I'm not wrong, it was published in Fire Technology, but I will check that and I will drop the link in the notes. It's giving you a lot more information in the algorithms behind the AI machines and allows you to build a better understanding of what's really happening in the computer when these algorithms are working. So, yeah, that's the technology of the future. In the next episode, we're going to talk a bit more on the technologies from the past, which I would say they are as exciting as AI. So I'm not going to give you more details yet, but it's also going to be a great, great episode, especially for ones who are doing fire safety engineering. So, yeah, look up to the next episode next Wednesday. And, yeah, thank you a lot for listening. Remember to share this with your colleagues with your friends let's build a community and reach to more and more people and yeah I want to do this long term I want to do it for you so I hope this community grows and there's more people I can serve with this podcast anyway it was great having you here today. See you next Wednesday. Thanks. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
