 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, session 68. Recently I've discovered that scientific conferences are not only great places to learn new stuff, build your social network and cater friendships, but are also fantastic hunting playgrounds for podcast guests. And yeah, that's what I did when I was in Brno last week at the Fire and Evacuation Modeling Technical Conference, which aligns very, very well with my usual scope of topics on this podcast. So you may be sure there will be a lot of guests coming to be shown up there because I found some really intriguing subjects that would need expansion in the podcast. And actually, immediately after the conference, it was not even immediately after the conference, immediately after his talk, when I saw John Gales talking about evacuation of airports, I immediately sent him an email. He owes me a podcast interview and we've quickly set up for a session in which we could expand on what he was showing at the Femtech. And I think this material here is a much more complete version because we're talking about his whole complete project on anthropometric measurement of people and movement speeds that he has performed for the SFP Foundation and his further work in airports, museums, care houses, and other types of facilities. So I've invited John. He's a great speaker. He's a great engineer. He's a great scientist. I knew that he is researching evacuation among other topics, but it really blew my mind how deep they went into figuring out the movement speeds in New York University, how much they've invested in research, how vast database they've collected, and really how big variability there is between buildings. That's the most intriguing part of this interview, I guess, that for different buildings, you will have completely different pedestrian walking speeds. You will have completely different behaviors that are driven not only by the characteristics of people, but also by the environment around them and the stimuli that they are subjected to. So I think it's a really interesting talk. The topic is much, much, much bigger than just a podcast interview. So John told me there's two resources that are the most complete that he would like to refer you to. And I usually do that at the end of the episode, but there's no point in waiting. I'll just tell you up front. Next year, they are having a book on egress modeling of pedestrians for the design of contemporary stadia in Springer. And that's going to show the complete stadia study, which we talk excessively in this podcast. So I'm very looking forward to that book going online. And John also mentioned the online course at York University where they combine human behavior, structural fire engineering, fire engineering altogether to provide a little different view on how to care for people evacuating in buildings. I think this may be very interesting. It's online. It starts on, I think, 17th October 2022 this year. I don't know when you're releasing, so there's a good chance it's not there. But he said it's cyclical. So I'll leave links in the show notes. And for now, I think you will get quite a lot of knowledge and value from the talk itself, because I did. So I hope you enjoy it. Dr. John Gales from York University. Let's go. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski, and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Firesize Show. I am today here with Dr. John Gales. Hey, John. Good to see you here. Hello. Thanks for having me. Yeah, thanks for answering my emails. That was very kind of you. You've had a great talk at the Femtech Conference and you didn't want to share everything, so I thought I have my own ways of extracting data from people. Yeah, we're up to a lot of, as I call, mischief. Let's do this. Let's extract some useful data from you. I hope it goes well. John, you were presenting interesting talk about evacuation studies in airports, but I know that in your rich curriculum, you have much more studies related to human behavior in fires, especially the movement. And one thing that always caught my attention was the project you had on anthropometric data, movement speedstone for the SFP Foundation. That was a hell of a work. So I would like to start there. How did you end up winning this project, and why did you even pursue this? Okay, I'll give you a short story, and if we have time, a longer version. So I've always had a fascination of history. And one thing that's always kind of bothered me is when people say, this code clause definitively comes from this source. And so people have talked about this two-and-a-half-minute, three-minute rule, or however you want to call it, for evacuation. And they've constantly have said that it goes back to one of the Edinburgh theatre fires, where people in 1911 stood up, ushered out to the anthem. The one with the anthem, okay, yeah, yeah. I've heard that story too. Yeah, which was two and a half, three minutes. However, if you really try to piece the literature back to 1911, it doesn't necessarily go there entirely. So a lot of the egress and building codes, when they were starting to emerge around that time, tended to cite the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Okay. When was that fire? In 1911, around that time. Ah, okay. The same time. tended to cite the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Okay. So... When was that fire? In 1911, around that time. Ah, okay. The same time. And the interesting thing about that fire, when you read the papers that were published around that time, so there's a number of ones that talk about it, they actually cite an incident that occurred in that fire where the exterior stair frame collapses at around that time, two and a half to three minutes. And then the engineers in New York for their own building code start saying two and a half, three minutes as the time that you need to get people out before exits become compromised. And I always thought that was really fascinating to look at the history point of view. And then I started to speak to Steve Gwynn. And fortunately, when I started my academic career, there was an archive of pre-recorded or recorded video lectures from Ghislaine Proulx when she taught human behavior at Carleton University. Prue when she taught human behavior at Carleton University. And I just kind of watched them excessively over a period of the winter and then started to think, okay, what kind of research could I do here? And then that just ballooned to looking at different building type. And at the time I was in Ottawa, you had stadiums, museums, and we just started doing a lot of data collection. The early stuff was really bad. But as we spoke with people, we tended to upgrade our equipment. We tended to upgrade our procedures. And the students just kind of loved the types of projects we were doing. Eight of us were doing a stadium study. Eight of us would go see a football match and record and watch the game at the same time. Not the best circumstances, yeah. So the short answer there is we had a lot of data at that point collected for stadiums, museums, and of different types of populations, but we didn't have the resources to analyze it. So then the SFP had to call. We put in and said, look, we have this video footage, but some financial support would actually help us get through the video footage a lot faster to get that data out there. And that's basically what happened there. We ended up collaborating a bit with Loon University as well, learned a ton of new techniques that could also be used within what we're doing in Canada. And, yeah, that's your long answer. I guess we came to some sort of medium-long answer. Yeah. I mean, you've covered 1911 in great detail, but further, like 90 years, you kind of rushed through that. Well, I am putting together another history paper right now. It's not based in the early 1900s, but more based in the last 50 years. And I'm hoping I finish it not in 10 years from now. Looking forward to that. The last one, the one on history of fire resistance was really cool, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, and we even had a podcast episode in here about that. So if any one of you here are not familiar with that story, it's also quite a story about how we came up to test our building elements to a certain curve and where did it come from and what were the missing puzzles in the story we didn't know. But in Canada, just to add to that, it's become a huge issue because what's happening right now and one of the things I'm wrestling with is there's a lot of people who like to use fire resistant time as the time for egress. Okay. Which is not compatible at all. who like to use fire-resistant time as the time for egress, which is not compatible at all. We had that happen too. I literally had buildings where we were designing evacuation from a skyscraper, and anyone dealing with evacuation of skyscrapers, you probably end up figuring out very quickly that the staircases in these buildings are not meant to evacuate everyone at the same time. They're pretty much well to handle, like two, three floors at the time. But if you drop everyone from the building into the staircase and tell them go, and it's a building with like 5,000 people, they're going to spend a whole lot of time in the staircase. And this is where we got our optimization target. Guys, we have 90-minute structure. We need to evacuate these people in 90 minutes. And it was craziness because it was so incompatible with the optimal way how to evacuate them, you know, selective evacuation, based evacuation. But even what we're seeing is with care homes as well. And that was one of the early topics that we were looking at with the human behavior studies is we were looking at elderly persons in care homes, and we were encountering a lot of this within their plans of saying, how much time do they have to actually evacuate an elderly person? And they would say, okay, well, there's 15 minutes for this, 60 minutes for that, and then they conclude 80 minutes or whatever. And there's so many case studies of long-term care home fires where smoke becomes a very big issue. That's just not a good approach. And so it's something I've kind of wrestled with, too, but coming from a structures background, it also helps with that discussion because you can tell people a little bit what this number actually means and what it doesn't mean and what it should be used for and you know it's it's a structural especially the assumptions for that are nowhere presentation of a real fire and the whole episode we did is is a very good testimony to that's the that's the big thing is is that and especially when you consider if somebody's trying to say 15 minute from a member or something like that and you understand that standard fire at 15 minutes, what it's actually representing is not what the actual real fire may be in that environment. Exactly. So you've mentioned elder care homes. easily to figure out how different groups of people, how different types of people, if I may call it like that, would evacuate, how would different building types affect it. When you start learning evacuation at a very basic level, you learn that human speed at a horizontal pathway is this, it changes to this on a staircase, on a slope it is this. And when they are irritated by smoke, it goes down to this. And that's pretty much the very basic conception about how we treat evacuation. And this is very awkward because we're talking about an average human. And the environment. Thank you, Valerian. about an average human. And the environment. I'll use sporting events for an example. In Canada, at least, you have, we call it football, and we call it soccer as well, or a different sport. One actually includes kicking a ball with your foot, and the other is... One's just knocking people down. And I'll refer to that. The sport where you knock people down appeals to demographics of about 18 to 45 of people that age group. And there's a lot of drinking as well. In Canada with soccer or where you're kicking the ball, you're really appealing to youth in terms of you have a lot of children attending these events, specifically in Canada, because the sport where you kick the ball is growing in a lot of... With your foot. Yeah. Cold football, yeah. Really, they should call it football. But that's growing in Canada at a very fast rate, and children are attending these games in large numbers. Now, they're not going to move at the same speeds as the older demographics, and they're also going to have very specific needs. We have a video we showed a while back where a mother waits until everybody's left the stadium to begin taking their child up the stairway. And the child is kind of tripping, basically, on the stairs. So you get these demographics that, like, the design may not fully account for these types of people in that sense. And then with the American football, where people are intoxicated, the level of intoxication during the egress of the stadium can affect how they're moving out of the stadium, especially within a crowd and such. And that is very poorly studied, because it's so hard to study because how do you greatly you know scientifically assess the degree of intoxication on the person from an ethical point of view because you you are putting people in harm's way uh if you are trying to control an experiment in that sense yeah so the the type of building can have various things and then different events like singers concerts can also bring in different demographics so it becomes really important to understand what each of these type of building can have various things and then different events like singers concerts can also bring in different demographics so it becomes really important to understand what each of these demographics are going to do in these spaces it's interesting what you say because you know in a way it is obvious uh you can have uh i don't know uh some kind of even religious event where you could attract for example other population that didn't happen in Poland. So one building, one space, the same sitting array, the same walking paths, the same evacuation exits, potentially completely different behaviors. And it's not even about assessing a distribution within a population. It is like entirely different populations to start with. I don't want to knock designs too much out there, but it's as if we've kind of decided we have a universal design, but it's not really a universal design yet. That tends to be one of the things that we're trying to research is moving towards. You were also investigating, for example, transport infrastructure. So I guess you also probably seen the impact of bags, the impact of child's cars, right? But more of the factors, because I think, you know, common knowledge is diversity is this, and maybe a standard deviation of that is this. That's how I would design. I would love to learn how diverse and how big differences are actually in this group. Yeah. Well, again, it's also the environment. So we've been studying a commuter airport. And early on, me and the students were going back and forth about, you know, how universal is the data to apply to other airports. And we have a commuter airport. We have mostly the same demographic going through it in terms of age you do get some kids so you do get some elderly persons as well but it's mostly that adult demographic that's going through but what's interesting is the different luggage types and the different items that they're carrying which then then start to impact their travel through that space. So we've seen quite a bit of that, but also with the commuter airports, the speed that we were seeing people move through that space was a lot higher than what the commonly accepted speeds that people would use from it. I don't want to call it legacy. Last time I called it legacy at a conference, people were not happy with it. I could call it legacy. I'm cool with that. No, but you mean the speeds, the usual, I would put like 1.2 meters per second or something. Yeah, people use like 1.3 or so. Some people do use some more appropriate ones that that go thank you john but i mean this the speeds we saw analyzing over like a thousand people um we were above two um with that but mind you it wasn't very large crowding which is a whole other thing we need to study is the fundamental diagrams that associate to this but even getting access to an airport is not something you commonly get. Giving through your reports, there's a lot of tables with numbers for different spaces, different pages, different disabilities as well, different packages. The report is available. I'll link to it in the show notes so everyone can take a look at the numbers that are there. But what strikes me is how scattered the data is. This 1.3 meters is not really representative to anything. In some cases you have speeds around 1.5, 1.6 with not that huge standard deviation. But then again, in other tables, you have like scatters from 0.3 to 5 meters per second. A standard deviation of 0.75 for a mean of 1.45. So that is a crazy scatter. I think with the report too, like one thing that isn't within the report, because like a report isn't meant to be 200 pages at this point. It's just meant to give you this is the outcome, and then the peer review papers afterwards kind of present more of the detail that goes into it. The statistical analysis on some of the speed profiles, like you can spot some that you might be like, okay, you know, there's a lot of deviation here, so this one may be not as certain as another one. But you can do a number of tests on the data to see if you are getting a level of statistical significance. And I think with the airport study that we did for FEMTC that's out there, the student has put together, like we only presented luggage and non-luggage, but the actual breakdown of different profiles is we did compile the profiles for here's somebody with light luggage, here's somebody with a heavier luggage, here's of them, there's just not enough data to conclusively say that this profile will have this effect. Whereas others where we do have low deviations, if you want to simplify it to that, and high sample numbers, we kind of have a good overview as to what that is. Sorry, and what if we, from a designer point of view, would you say that the differences between these environments were so significant that you should have an individual approach to, I don't know, airport versus stadium versus a care home? The data sets are so different, or you can come up with this, again, a generalized average human with a reasonable standard deviation that will be good enough for design i don't think so not at this not not not with where human health is trajectory in my view uh with things like you really need three hours for these things to talk about everything but uh i think what we have have is that in the 1970s and 80s, where we started to just use flows and not really think beyond, well, some people were, but it wasn't really pushed too much. There's still people who will say, okay, I'm going to use that data. And there's other people who say, okay, yes, that's great. But that data is representative of a population from 1970 in this particular space and under these conditions. And we know that, you know, people are, we have more elderly persons now. We have all those, people may not be as fit. People, I mean, people are heavier. I mean, even last night I made an Uber order to McDonald's, so we're not as healthy. But what worries me too is it's going beyond just... There's a number of health ailments that are happening to people which are invisible you know in terms of like you may look at somebody you may say hey that that person is six foot tall their legs are clearly going to move at a particular speed based on some anthropometry but you can't see that they may you know they may have had a stroke in the past and they may not move at that speed and fine Maybe that's one out of a thousand people in space or whatever. I don't quote that number, but I'm just using it as an arbitrary example to then say, let's consider a long term care facility now where we know the population is 99 percent with a level of invisible disability. a level of invisible disability, then you know that if you are designing for that, you need to be paying careful attention to the care that's going to have to happen to moving them if they can't move on their own and the resources that are required to that. But if you try to use a universal approach, you're on a very slippery slope in some cases, and I think that's why you see sometimes in canada the fire resistance rating being used is somebody says okay 15 minutes add 60 minutes to that and that's the number but you then arrive with a long-term care facility where somebody's arguing that they have 85 minutes to escape and you know that's not going to work out so well when you were looking at these data sets was there like anything that that surprised you that would like go completely against our previous understanding intuition like i guess the example of this tall person might have had a strong is a very graphical one on how it may be different from our preconceptions. But going through this, were there some things you found like that? Yeah, I think some of the speed differences were higher than we thought. And the one that I thought was really interesting was the alcohol study with the stratium. was the alcohol study with the stratium. That one's really interesting and funny in a way, is that you sometimes actually, if you really look at the data, you start to see that people speed up moving into a beer tent. Obviously, you can understand that they would speed up, but the drop-off in speed that would occur after they leave. Now, I think that that's important, and it makes sense, is that a lot of these speeds are not just, okay, this is a population traveling through space. This is a population influenced by stimuli. And then their urgency to get somewhere, just like in the airport, the commuter airport where they're really trying to move fast to catch the plane. There's stimuli that affects these numbers. And if you just raw take the numbers and say, here's the numbers, but not really talk about what is happening in the environment around them, then you get, you know, different speeds. So you could buy raw, like use these in a pedestrian model, but they may not be appropriate for an emergency case either because that's a whole other stimulus. And I think that starts to make things really interesting is the range of differences, even in the same space, based on stimuli. And that you may think that you're getting a worst case scenario, but you're actually not. you're getting a worst case scenario, but you're actually not. Because like, I'll give an example, fire in a stadium. A lot of people like to whip out their cell phones, start taking photos of it, and they're not egressing or so. They're trying to gather more information, and you can explain why they're doing that. So you can process it later. That's good. information and you can explain why they're doing that you can process it later that's good yeah well you can see how they're you can see that they don't that there is a percentage of that population that doesn't leave now let's say the same stadium has a rain event a torrential downpour of water it's unexpected through the day that can actually be worse than the fire because at that point not just a group of people in one part of the stadium are leaving. Now you have the whole stadium trying to leave at the same time and trying to find shelter and then clogging the interior portions of the stadium as well, causing a larger crowding event. And for us, that was probably the most interesting collection of data that we found with the stadium work was monitoring a rain event. I wouldn't say controlled way is we set up at the stadium for over a week because there's events every day. And we were able to position cameras in corridors and locations to get flow densities and speeds of which people would move. And because you can find lots of videos of people in stadiums and rain events and know that they're moving fast. But if you want to actually quantify the numbers, you need to write angles. And that was pretty alarming what people were doing. The video shows some very quick movements. Radio shows some very quick movements, and there was one with a lady who had a cane, who in your normal circumstance, you would say that that person would fit, to say, one of the elderly person's profile. But she was moving very fast, and that cane was clearing away for her. But, you know, when you're looking at it, you do have to look at, okay, what is the certainty of everything that you're putting together? But I will say that stimuli has a huge effect on movements for people who are coming outside of human behavior and just think you can just apply one number to it. There's a lot going on. It's super interesting how you claim that the torrential rain could be like a more immediate cause to evacuate than fire. And if I think about it now, it's quite logical. I also would like to take a picture. So for me, it's scientifically justified if I do that. For everyone else, it's not. It was something that early on we were talking amongst ourselves. Through the ethics reviews that we do on these studies, we can't do the action. We can't set an alarm. We can't, like through the ethics reviews that we do on these studies, we can't do the action. We can't set an alarm. We can't cause a fire or something like that. You just can't do that. What you can do is you can wait for an event to occur, which may take some time to do. And in our case, the year before, we were at the stadium when it rained, but we weren't collecting data. And we saw what was happening. And then the next year we said, okay, for this year, we're going to try to make sure we can capture a rain event, and one day out of the week it's got to rain. So we were monitoring the stadium for the whole day. As long as it takes to rain. And the funny bit was is myself and Tim, one of the graduate students, decided to go visit the students at the stadium during, just to see how they were doing. And then we had the torrential rain and there was only two umbrellas. So unfortunately for Georgette, she lost her umbrella. Oh, how evil. When you say you cannot trigger an event, you know, I had this funny one thing in my career. We are doing a lot of host book tests. I've said it on the podcast a lot of times. Then one time we were, after commissioning a new railway station in Krakow, they've planned some sort of evacuation. Like, it was not even an evacuation drill. It was more like a drill for all the emergency services of the city. Coordinated stuff. We knew that two minutes before noon, we set up the fire. After some time, it must be detected. Firefighters will come and they will put it down. There were people pretending they're casualties and, you know, all these interesting things that happens at big drills. And obviously on the station itself, they were announcing, communicating, okay, in 10 minutes we begin an emergency test. Please follow the messages and evacuate immediately. And it was repeated multiple times. Now, what they didn't think through, I guess maybe they did think through, but when we started the fire and then a train arrived from Warsaw with like 200 people exiting it, so they just literally, they didn't know and they literally just entered a burning railway station. That's where your data is and things. Now I wish I had 40 GoPros, you know, because I would have captured that. And we, at this point, we were doing our job as people who did this. But it was interesting. It's a good point to make, too, about collecting the data, is that in a lot of those cases, like you get some information, there's an ingrained training that's happening with it. But because people would know that they're in a training exercise as opposed to the real thing, which is why our group hasn't, you know, there's people who can do that really well, who can create a lab experiment and get good quality data from that. Our group has tended to focus on let's do field work and from that field work if people know that they're in a drill they're not really going to take that very seriously if they don't know that they're in the drill they're going to display you know other types of behaviors and such so it's really important to kind of categorize, you know, what is the context of what the data collection actually is. The museum study that we did was, you know, along those lines is we had a false alarm, and then they did the annual drill over the course of the, because you can observe, every building in Canada has to do annual drills. So you can observe that. And then these are, you know, they're not informed to people. And you can get some more realistic data, but there's no smoke, there's no visible fire or anything like that. But you can get some useful information, but you're not going to get the exact emergency response to it. And I wondered, do you have, like, accidents happen? There's CCTV everywhere. Do you have access to that? But that's where things get tricky, is in many cases where an accident does happen, those videos become part of a legal process, so you're not going to get access to them. What has been really good on our team for the students that have worked on us, especially early on, a lot of our initial students were already practicing engineers. And we were very fortunate that one of our graduate students was an authority having jurisdiction and was able to do a study. And we did this study in 2015 2016 but we couldn't publish it until last year so the release time was still a factor of the of the information but you can sometimes be fortunate to get some of the these video footages but it comes with a lot of time and it has to be in a circumstance where there isn't that legal thing and then you get the second thing in the university setting is you have two procedures happening you have ethics and then you have the the disclosure agreements that have to occur with with the structures and many times the disclosure agreement is a lot more severe than the ethics requirement. And you're finding yourself working in that, and it becomes a really important relationship with the organization to get to a state where you can actually publicly talk about it, which, to answer your question earlier about why we don't talk about what we're doing and you only see our work three or four years later, is quite related to that we can't just go out and say to people, you know, we're doing something here or we're doing something there. It takes time to be able to release it. And it must be quite challenging to even categorize your agents in your observations because it's not that you can go into a person at the end of the airport. Hello, we've been recording you since you exited from the plane from New York. Can you please tell me, do you have any disability? I mean, you don't know. So it was based on your observation how you did? You won't. And in some cases, if you have time, so like some of the stadium studies do have those surveys where we have grown up to people afterwards because we've had a year to plan it and we've been able to put stuff together with that type of study with the airport the most we can do is just say hey you're being recorded as you go through this corridor but there's no survey that follows it uh or something like that if you tried to do that it would probably tack on another i mean for us maybe other people have different procedures they have to follow but for us it would tack on probably about another year or two on the study to be able to even get clearance that to talk to the people who are going through it so the answer also is they probably wouldn't want to talk to us at the end anyway because they're trying to catch their flight. In one of your studies, the maximum walking speed was 7 meters. That's like 14 seconds for 100. That's not a bad score at all. That's really decent time. I don't think I would make it. I'm impressed by the numbers in your study. We've touched a little on CCTV. If you're comfortable talking about it, I would like to know how you do these measurements because there's a lot of ears listening to the podcast, people doing their experiments. So let's share the best practices. How do you do that? A little bit of magic. Okay, well, first off, some of the CCTV footage that you're going to get is going to be of a very low frame rate. And if that's the case, it may not be as easily usable. So there are tracking softwares out there that you kind of need to adapt a little bit to the frame rate of what you're doing. You also have the resolution. So some buildings may not have very high resolution footage either. For us, I mean, if you can get into an environment where the organization is doing the recording and providing the footage after, the ethics clearance is a lot easier to do. If you try to put up cameras yourself, then you run into a lot more barriers with it, at least that's been our experience. In some cases, you have to because the footage is just not suitable for the software to be able to do that. The second thing is, which I think is actually the fun and more relaxing part, is the surveying of the environment. and more relaxing part is the surveying of the environment so you go back and because your angle of your footage may not be perfect to to like say like the airport that is a linear path so it's very easy to say where everybody is but you may have a space where it's not linear and people can move in different trajectories so you may need to have an extensive survey done so that you can calibrate points throughout the area. But it's kind of relaxing doing that because you're just going out to the site for the day and popping things around, doing measurements. It's nice. And then that data goes into these types of softwares. You get a grid formed, and then you can start to track the trajectories. So what we've then done is we do it with the software, but we also do it manually to confirm that the path is actually what is being, you know, that we're getting the same thing as if we tried to do it manually. And when you do it manually, the time it takes to make even one profile is just, it's so taxing on people, especially if you have a student doing it for three hours, trying to come up with these. Their brain just can't stay focused. So you try to make automated approaches. And that's actually where our group is moving towards is developing ways to do automation for data collection. And that's what's hidden underneath of our lab right now is a number of technologies that we're working with to come up with ways of converting the raw footage directly into data, but it's not using cameras. It's more or less using 3D mapping if you want to simplify. Okay. I mean, you see these disturbing Big Brother-style videos where cameras on the street would immediately pick you up, do face recognition on you, and they seem to be doing that. Every time somebody shows me where that is, I'm saying I'm just wasting my time trying to come up with this technology because some proprietary company has already done it. I actually had this idea in my mind like seeing the struggle with the ethical approvals of all of this stuff. If you could actually develop a camera with some sort of Raspberry Pi computer that would do all the processing and in the end, the output of this device would be just data on movement with no images. That would be like the perfect. But you would lose the ability to supervise it, right? Well, you also can't say who is who. So you get speeds, right? But you don't know anything about what this individual was. Unless you're government and you know everything from the face. Well, I think a lot of that is kind of where it's heading because it's so different from one area to another what you're allowed to do and what you're not allowed to do. So if you go to the United States and you're trying to collect data, even if you wanted to use a camera, you're just not going to be allowed. And it doesn't matter what ethics procedures you go through. It's just not going to be allowed. And it doesn't matter what ethics procedures you go through, it's just not going to happen. And then you're in a different environment where, you know, using CCTV footage is okay, but it's very tricky to that. But I think it would, it does have a lot of benefit to spend time on technology that can do these things in much more ethical ways. And I think a lot of that technology is there. And as I said before, I think a lot of people have already done it. It's just it's very proprietary and not so much used for research questions, right? Like we want to study science, right? We want to be able to understand these types of things. So it becomes a bit tricky in that sense. But I think from an academic point of view, I think we can move if we want to develop something that's freely available for people to use. And I think that's kind of our goal. Having done this piece of work over the last years, how would you see the impact of that on the community? How do you see the future use of that? Or maybe the future is endless research. We are very, like our industry partners, we work very closely with them. And we report quite a bit with them. So, for example, I was talking to you a little bit before about traveling. example i was talking to you a little bit before about traveling so what we used to do each year before covid was is we did a trip to the uk and europe or something with the students students presented their work to the industry partners showed them what they're working on to get the information into the system one critical thing about canadian academia is our licensure procedure for the student trainees that we work with is they need to be doing, at least it's encouraged if they want to become a consultant or a practicing engineer, that they are doing applied research that's being used by a company. So if they're not, then they can't really claim the research. But if they are, then they can say, okay, my research is being used for this particular project. That really elevates the training for the students. And that also helps motivate the students doing the work because they see that their work is going to be used. And they're seeing it's happening on a real project. That's a work-out case study that you can present afterwards, which is great. For the most part, and they get the experience of actually talking to consulting engineers about what they're actually doing. So we've been very fortunate to have these relationships with companies to allow the students, and that's where most of our students end up working is they'll integrate into consultancy afterwards and not trust much of the evacuation modeling that they're asked to review. But that's what comes from that. But, yeah, that's something that has been an emphasis in terms of getting the data out there. A lot of the data is communicated directly to the companies that are funding it. And then also the buildings that we're studying, a lot of that data is used towards improving the operations of these facilities. So you tend to see, and that's why I mentioned this, that we've been fortunate that some of our students have been AHJs or authorities having jurisdiction, that that has allowed buildings to become safer after the work that we've done and i think that's been a really neat impact to you know back to some of these places and just see how things have have changed and it's sometimes kind of funny because one time we were talking to one of our consultancy partners and they're like your student can't say that your student isn't a practicing engineer and he's not an authority having jurisdiction you can't say that like well knowing he's actually in charge of this nice so um but uh yeah no it it's been great we we have a super team at york with the students that have come in and it's just uh fantastic to work with them how often do you see we should come back to this study? Your observations, you started with the data from 80s, 90s, and you've said a lot has changed. How often do you recommend to get yourself a million dollars to revisit that? Oh, you don't get a million dollars. Oh, you don't get a million dollars. Snap, I chose the wrong industry. I think that's the problem in human behavior research million you don't get a million dollars so snap i chose the wrong i chose the wrong industry no i think that's the problem in human behavior research is and i complain i don't complain about it but i i think there's a misunderstanding sometimes that people think that there's you know lots of money in this in terms of there should be but a lot of people studying this are not you know like you might get a sfp grant but that's not a huge grant you might get a another one whereas in the structural field there's larger funding packages that come in a lot of the human behavior research we've we've done is we have we can get a bit of consultancy funding but we're able to leverage it to support a student which which works out pretty well but the technologies that we're using actually come out of the structural domain so like the camera systems that we use are ones that we were using for structural fire experiments. So we have high-resolution cameras that can do these types of data capture, as you mentioned about the GoPro in your email, things like that. We have all these tools that can be multi-use, which is what's worked really well for us, is that we are a structures group, but we do human behavior, and we've kind of adapted technologies that were used elsewhere into this field, and that's one way we've been able to not need a million dollars for equipment. But it's, yeah, but to answer your question about how often you want to go back, I think right now my outlook is this, is I think it's exciting about collecting data pre-COVID, but I think post-COVID or wherever you are feeling where we are with COVID right now, it doesn't matter too much in that sense. It matters that we have a society that is not only aging but we have concerns about health and other influences that are occurring and i think it's starting to become really necessary to understand these implications a lot more on our built infrastructure and i think that's where some things are going to go and I think it would be very interesting if you could obtain older video footage from 1970s and 1980s but most of it is discarded and then go back to some of these buildings and see how different demographics actually are and speeds actually are. When you were saying that, I also thought that we may be better at recognizing the diversity. We may be better in acknowledging the disabilities. Many years ago, I would just put all the disabilities underneath the umbrella of my safety margin in my evacuation study. So whenever someone would ask me, like, have you considered disabilities in 2010? I would say, oh, yeah, yeah, you see this multiplied by 1.3? They are all there. I have hidden them in my safety factor. The same for the population bias. Even cultural differences in the way how people will dress will affect this. There's going to be a hell of a difference if you evacuate in Florida or in northern countries. Well, we had an evacuation in a snowstorm that we were monitoring. Nobody wanted to leave the building. So, yeah, no, there's a lot that goes there. I think it all just comes down to how certain you are about what you have in the mall and how you can justify that certainty. But it's exciting. It'd be nice if the community could grow a lot larger because there's so many questions that can be looked at. And it's just like you don't have time to go through them all. And some of these studies take years to begin with but they're if you look at what are the most commonly used services and in some of these in fire engineering probably you know human behavior is going to be used a lot more than structural fire in some cases in some places because of the challenges we also need like simple models you know we also um you also need to be calculate this this flow of people very quickly quickly to give a robust estimation of what the required safe evacuation time would be for a building. Sometimes when you go into complex scenarios, like understanding what you said about the football match. If you would like to know a whole image of that stadium, you would need to do 100 simulations, each for a different type of event, each with different scatter of your input parameters, distributions. And on each model, how long it takes to run it. Yeah, but sometimes you just need a quick, robust information. So there's also a future for these average meters, and we also need to have basic understanding in that, of course, right? Well, and that's a huge problem with it because people don't have a basic view about human behavior in fire, and that's why you see all these myths that are thrown all over the place. And if you go on Twitter or wherever you want, there's always a discussion of trying to educate the news networks to use different words. And we're still stuck with general populations believing in 1911 theories. And we need a lot more dissemination of what this actually is for people to understand, you know, even when they're in an environment. Like most people go in the stadium and they're going up and down stairs, they don't understand that there is rules for the threads of the stairs and they just may say, oh, this is a really badly designed stairway and, you know, they don't know that there's actually a serious problem here. And until somebody trips and falls and there's a huge lawsuit that falls out. John, as you said, it can take three hours to discuss this. Or you could take my course. Okay, you have a course. How do you provide it? It is taught online, actually. Does it cost a million dollars? I don't know how much it costs. It's the University of the Times. But it's taught. It'll actually be running next month at the University of Waterloo. Annually it's at Waterloo, and we do host it at York, and then occasionally I've done it at WPI. So it's eight modules, and very different than most of the other courses in the sense that we spend more time on the behavioral theory than we do on the modeling so trying to understand what is the the basics of the model so it's a pretty good one so if you like to know how fire dynamics and structures and fire integrate into a human behavior and fire course that's that's the one so i'll take a look i might actually send someone your way it's online right it's remote yeah It's online, right? It's remote. Yeah, it's online. It's fully online and I think it's running the week of October 17th. Okay, that's cool. I'll make sure to send you a link. There's assignments though. So that's why you agreed so easily to this podcast episode. You should have told me. I would plug it in. You don't have advertisements in your thing, do you? No, no. I was also curious. You mentioned the course by Guy and Prue. Is this also somewhere available, or this was in the archives of Carlton? No, that one is still, if we were to make it available, we should go through the family. I see. But we just haven't decided what to do with the footage. We do have the lectures. They are preserved. It's just deciding what to ultimately do with them. They are public recordings that were made of a version of the course in 2004 or 2005 or so. They're really interesting. Don't do that. Come on. It would be really nice to get them out, but I think it needs a lot of delicate conversations and things like that. But they were used heavily to influence the curriculum that we were using for even our own. And when you look at the impact that course had, and I was talking to the folks at WPI a couple years ago like even their curriculum was inspired by what she developed like she was a huge huge influence on human behavior and fire and it was really unfortunate of her passing and and then in Canada how afterward the field just kind of was stagnant then Steve came over and started telling people to study it. People began to study it again in high numbers. So, yeah, as you know, our history of fire engineering is not really well documented. No, it is absolutely not. And me having this podcast is one way to provide an open access archive, maybe your future self. You're up to 60 some odd episodes now? Yeah, it's going to be 68 I think. I hope in 100 years the new John Gales, the next Indiana Jones of Fire will, with a passion for history, will uncover this podcast. I'm just going to show up to one of these conferences with one of those hats or the fedora hat and just say, that study belongs in a museum. If you have one minute, I have a joke about Indiana Jones in the UK. There's these ref panels and Indiana Jones has just founded a foundation of Yath or whatever. And then he goes into a ref panel and there's people asking him, Dr. Jones, could you please provide the impact of your research and the novelty? Can you please comment on that? I've watched a few shows sometimes that have tried to portray academia and I've just been like, I that have tried to portray academia, and I've just been like, I can't watch this. This would never be allowed to happen. So I'm just going to stop it right here and walk away. Okay, John. Too many. Okay, thank you so much for coming to the show. It was a pleasure, and I guess I'll see you around in here again. Great. And that's it. Thank you, John. It was a pleasure. I guess I'll see you around in here again. Great. And that's it. Thank you, John. It was a pleasure to talk to you as usual. My takeaways from this interview are that human behavior is driven not only by your own characteristics but largely due to environment and also due to stimuli. The beer tent study that John told about when people were accelerating towards the tent and decelerating when they were leaving it, or the study where they have measured immense speed of people who were running late for airplanes, it just shows that, yeah, it's not so simple. You cannot average humans into one walking speed with a standard deviation of this. It's a much more complicated matter. I guess for some aspects of engineering, of course, depending on what uncertainty you're aiming for, what modeling accuracy you're aiming for, how rough is your assumption? I guess there are cases in which just having an average walking speed and simple top-of-the-head estimation of the evacuation time, in which this assumption of just having an average would be okay. But when you really want to do engineering, when you really want to understand the structure you are building, I guess making an individual individual approach. Like John mentioned, it's really, really powerful. And I think I will follow that path more in the future. I cannot say I did that a lot in the past, but, hey, I'm learning just like you guys. I'm improving my engineering. I want to be the very best like no one's ever been. So, yeah, I have to be the very best, like no one's ever been. So, yeah, I have to learn. I like that he's presented data. Outside of the book that will be published next year, there's plenty of research papers that really go deep into the subject John mentioned, the way how they measure the results. There's SFP Foundation Report, which I link in the show notes, which has a summary of all the measurements they have done for the foundation and has really good data useful data for for modeling different types of buildings so you definitely should look that up and there were other studies in in the literature that also tackle for example the pre-movement time in different spaces and these are also very useful combined with this new measurements of velocities that they give you a completely new way to design the evacuation process for your structure. This is very nice development in fire safety engineering. And again, as John said, evacuation modeling is probably more common than structural fire safety engineering. This is something we use almost every day. So it touches almost every of us. So very nice to learn that. Very nice to have resources. Thank you very much, John, for all your research. Thank you for building a fantastic fire engineering group at York University. You sound like you're having a blast there researching fire, and that's what I love. And to you listeners, I'm still a little low that's what i love and to you listeners i'm still a little low on the five star ratings you know i would really appreciate if if you like the show you could drop me a rating that helps me way more than you think and uh it would be very nice to to to see this uh this coming because it uh builds confidence in the podcast it builds credibility it helps the podcast show up in search results for people on various lists of what to listen so yeah you have more power than you think and I really appreciate if you could use it dropping me a 5 star and maybe writing a review it takes 10 seconds of your time and it will be greatly helpful to the show and that is it for today. I guess I see you next Wednesday with another interesting episode. Cheers. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
