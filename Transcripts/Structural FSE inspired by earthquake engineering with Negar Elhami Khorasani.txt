 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show in the Fire Science and Engineering Community. It's not that we always have to come up with solutions from scratch. It's always a great idea to inspire by success of other groups of engineers, because they may have solved some of the things we are desperately looking for. And one of such an inspiration comes from Earthquake Engineering Community, or civil engineering related to earthquakes who are using performance-based engineering and in fact probabilistic performance-based engineering a lot in their practice and that inspired some fire engineers to try and use that approach for fire safety and as you may guess that's exactly the subject of today's episode. I have invited Dr. Negar Elami Kourasny from University of Buffalo to talk about the use of probabilistic approaches in structural fire engineering. I know structural fire engineering is already an advanced thing on its own, and here we are going one step above in the complexity, but trust me, it's worth it. You will learn a lot of interesting stuff related to building performance in FHIR, which in essence is some sort of distribution of possible scenarios and damage and failure rates. It's very natural to position that as a probabilistic problem. And that's what we're going to talk today. Well, we're not going to talk about probabilities. We are going to discuss a framework, a really useful tool that can be directly applied to engineering. So even if you're not very interested in structural fire engineering, I hope that this topic will be interesting to you because this framework can be adapted for any other part of fire safety engineering, I guess. Now, before I let you into the podcast episode, I have to share some stuff about the podcast. I have took a look into statistics. January is ending and I am absolutely astonished with the growth of the show. There has been over 5,000 listens to the podcast in January. That's the best month ever by far in the show. And it makes me very, very happy that the podcast is reaching so many engineers. I also see a lot of traffic on older episodes. That means a lot of people are listening to the whole of the show, which also is a good indication that you like it. And I see a lot of new people in the podcast, and that makes me truly, truly happy. So I have not had a chance to welcome all of you new listeners to the Firescience Show, so please feel welcome to this family. I hope the podcast is useful to you. I hope you find a lot of great resources in here. You can always reach me through the webpage or email vojtjehatfirescienceshow.com to share your feedback ideas. I try to be very responsive to those and I really try to incorporate what I learn from you. So if you're new here, if you're an old comer, I hope the podcast is meeting your expectations and you enjoy it a lot. Now, enough of my rambling because there's a great episode of today.

And now back to your episode on probabilistic structural fire engineering. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Fire Science Show. Today, I'm here with Dr. Negar Elami Khorasny from University of Buffalo. Hello Negar. Hi Wojciech, thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure for me to participate in this Fire Science Show. That's so nice. I'm very happy to meet you and to do this interview. The topic I've proposed for today's talk is on probabilistic structural fire engineering, which I guess is a step up from just structural fire engineering. I guess it's going to be interesting. I've had an episode with Thomas Jernay about structural fire engineering on the podcast, but maybe we could give a short introduction to anyone who missed that one, to what structural fire engineering is and how it differentiates from this typical code-based fire engineering we are used to. So let's start with structural fire engineering and then we're going to up the game to the probabilistic one. Sure, definitely. I listened to your podcast with Thomas, a great friend and colleague, and I wouldn't be able to beat him on this mission, but I'll try. So to put it in perspective for your audience, the prescriptive approach we all know, it's basically you follow the code or the rules, and it's presumed that it provides acceptable performance. But we don't actually check what performance we're going to get as a world of structural system. Whereas with structural fire engineering, or I'm going to link it to performance based design, it's basically a procedure that enables the design of the structure, whether it's a building, whether it's a tunnel, whether it's a bridge, that you look at the performance of the structure and you make sure to get this predefined or desirable performance whatever that is that's set acceptable for that project yeah and i know that in the u.s people are doing a lot of efforts to make performance-based uh structural fire engineering um a thing in the design so so maybe let's let's take it a little step further. What does it enable? Like what's the benefit of me if I'm a billion-dollar investor in my building and I would like to go that path, how would you sell it to me? Is it even possible? Right, right. As part of, again, the academia, when we talk about it, we definitely focus a lot on the safety side. When we talk about it, it definitely focuses a lot on the safety side. And we say, okay, with advances in new materials, in new different techniques and structural systems, it's definitely safer if you design using structural fire engineering so that you know how the structure would perform. Once we start talking with the industry, however, definitely also bring in the aspect of economy and how it makes sense for the industry to invest in the approach because they could save money. One of the examples that we've demonstrated, not necessarily in terms of, we haven't quantified the cost yet, but in terms of quantity of material, for example, it's this composite floor system that even with one of your podcasts on BRE and Card, okay, let's say you've got composite floor system, you have got steel beams and steel girders and then concrete slat on top. If you remove the insulation on the beams, interior beams, you do not necessarily have issues with the fire safety side. And then if you have a multi-story structure, then imagine how much insulation you're saving, not just in terms of material, but also the labor cost of applying that insulation. So these are some of the cases that we actually, through this, there was a project in the U.S., again, four industry companies got involved. And one of the primary systems that they looked at was this type of system. And then they applied structural fire engineering, compared it with prescriptive approach, and showed that, okay, they're actually buildings, fulfilled the requirement, even if the installation was not applied everywhere. So that's the economy side of things. But we also have challenges in the U.S, so it's not just all good stories. In the US, we are pushing towards structural fire engineering. At this stage, it is officially in the code. We have this ASCE 7. It describes all the loads. So in the appendix, this performance-based design for fire. So now it means that it's official and industry can use it. However, what we're trying to do as part of the community here in the U.S. is to spread the knowledge and train the workforce. Because until we have enough people who are comfortable using structural fire engineering, it probably won't get used too much. So that's another aspect that we are trying to contribute to, to make sure that this concept gets established in the US. I wonder within the current paradigm of fire testing, of structural performance of the building being the point in terms of, you know, classes, ratings, as it is now. Given the pace of the development of new technologies, new solutions, new materials, at some point it must be a factor that either slows down or a factor in which risky solutions get passed through because someone gamed the index and they found a way. I guess if you look at it from this point of view, I guess fire engineering is inevitable. I wonder how long the paradigm can sustain. What's your thoughts on this challenging? There are two potential outcomes here. There are two potential outcomes here. One is that we manage to push this forward quick enough that it gets used and people keep up with it. The other way, which is not perhaps a positive outcome, is when maybe we get structures that we don't know exactly how they perform and then something goes wrong and then there will be the societal impact and people will not be happy, right? As soon as, you know, something finds its way in the news and then everybody would know about it that, okay, there was a mistake or there was a lack of knowledge. It's definitely not something we want to happen, but often when something like that, again, occurs, then the academicians and industry and everybody tries to move quickly and find the solutions, say, okay, now, sorry, we should have done this. Okay, maybe now it's time to adopt structural fire engineering. So hopefully we end up with path one where we realize how important it is as a community and try to, again, develop the competency to use it across nation. The one challenge we are facing here in the U.S. is that a lot of people realize that how important it is. And when I talk about structural fire engineering, it's not about, okay, every single building needs to be designed using structural fire engineering. It's just not maybe worth it if you have a two-, three-story structure. If it's a regular structure, that's not the argument we're trying to make here, that, okay, you have to apply for it, and prescriptive design is gone. No, no, no, no, that's not the idea. It apply for it and prescriptive design is gone. No, no, no, no. That's not the idea. It's about all these special cases or cases that the prescriptive approach will not provide us perhaps a safe design. Then maybe people start listening. But with the variety of materials, the variety of solutions, the creativity of architects and just having this puzzle as an enabler for creativity, you know, because there is a way you can maybe make a very interesting building, which was prohibited because of the rigid requirements of the code before. Maybe that's something that would push for more creativity in this space. And the more of this variety comes in, the bigger role of structural fire engineering. That's already a big jump from something where you assume the safety or acceptable performance to the point where you measure acceptable performance. And now let's make another leap into the probabilistic aspect. So where does the probabilistic aspect come from? What does it replace in the paradigm of structural fire engineering? And in general, maybe let's start with how did you start working on this? What made you think that this is worth spending many years of your career investigating? It actually, for me, started as part of my PhD. I started in 2010, and a lot of my thinking has been influenced by the work in earthquake engineering so well performance-based design in earthquake engineering it's it's mature relatively to you know structural fire engineering and it breaks down the problem into these four boxes okay they call it hazard analysis structural analysis fragility analysis which is equivalent to damage, quantification of damage, and then loss analysis. So these four boxes, they're linked together. So you start from hazard, you go to analysis, structural analysis, then fragility, then loss. And each box is a model or set of models. And these models depend on uncertain inputs. They're not necessarily deterministic. They can be, but within the probabilistic approach, each box has its own uncertain inputs and parameters that produces a probabilistic outcome. And then the probabilistic outcome of one box feeds into the next box, which itself could also have other specific probabilistic inputs. If I want to explain each box within the structural fire engineering world, the first one, I guess it's trivial. It's the hazard box. So it's about modeling the fire scenarios and the likelihood of those events. So we won't stop at saying that, okay, we're going to have, let's say a compartment inside a building and it has one fuel load density, it has one ventilation factor. And let's use, you know, your code parametric model and we get a temperature time curve. We won't stop at that. There are inputs to that box. I mentioned two of them, ventilation and fuel load density. Now we make them, we assign a distribution to those inputs. And therefore, instead of getting one temperature time curve, we get a series of temperature time curves. So here in the previous paradigm or just the basic way of thinking, you would have a scenario that is described either by the code, which could be like a standard fire curve, which also is kind of a scenario, or you could use some sort of model like a zone model or CFD model to come up with your temperature. But then again, you are limited here to what you've put into the model, which was most likely a certain data point, like a fuel load, like you said, the ventilation factor, where in reality it's like hundreds of outcomes that can come up. So how do you define them in this probabilistic framework? You provide ranges of these values? And where do you take these ranges from? Exactly. So there are a couple of points here. One is, correct, first, as a user of this procedure, you have to decide which model you want to use. And as you mentioned, it can range from, okay, the, well, I'm going to set aside the standard fire curve because that's just from, let's say. That's where you should go. Sorry. Right. So, that aside, we have the parametric, maybe temperature time curve all the way to, we could have CFD model, we could have zone models in between. So, the level of complexity differs. And the different each model records different inputs with let's say the parametric fire we list all the inputs we could do so i'm kind of going to deviate now for each of these models you can do a sensitivity analysis that's the first so you you say okay these are all my inputs now i need to it's not one value per input. There's a range. Now for each of them, let's say fuel load, that was a study by itself. We've spent a year or two just looking at surveys, surveys that are out there, fuel load density surveys, and try to quantify the uncertainty in fuel load density. And it's not an easy task because it varies. It's based on occupancy, and it could change based on country even because the type of loads you may have, type of furniture you may have, it may vary from place to place. Even stuff like company culture, like one company would have a clean desk policy and keep everything in closets. Others would like, well, like my desk is not very clean. No, we actually encountered that. We did office, just a parenthesis as part of this discussion. There was a study supported by National Fire Protection Association and FBA. There was a study supported by National Fire Protection Association and FBA. And actually, this study was a collaborative project with Thomas Grenet, Professor Grenet. And we wanted to apply a new method to survey fuel load density. But I'm going to jump into the conclusion because that's relevant to this discussion. We surveyed offices at universities because we were just the point of that project was to develop the methodology not necessarily getting you know fuel density and apparently uh academicians we have a lot of books and papers and exam notes and all that so the amount of fuel density that we calculated was much much higher than perhaps within the code and what we had expected because a lot of paper and those papers all burned. So again, it was under category of office, but it was just an office inside a university building. Okay. A different type of office. Okay. Different type of office. So it makes a difference. Indeed. So you have these different inputs. Let's continue on that. So you have different inputs. So fuel, again, you do surveys. Ventilation, you still have to assign a distribution. With ventilation, there are different approaches. If you really don't know, I'll give an example. If you really don't know and you could still make engineering judgment in the sense that there's a minimum, there's a maximum. Right. Because you've got windows, you've got doors and you can assume that, OK, it will vary within that range. It's not going to be outside of that range. So knowing those inputs, you put it into the model. There's also if you want to make it really complete, there's also the model uncertainty. In a sense that if you're working with a certain zone model or a certain CFD, the idealization that goes into the model also makes a difference in terms of the output you're getting. So you should be considering some uncertainty on the model side as well. And what's the benefit of going through all this hassle? Why not just picking the worst case scenario? How does this change your, like, what's the benefit you get from going through this? Because at the end of the day, when you go through all the four boxes, you get basically the probability of having the loss and the distribution of that loss. So rather than getting one value, you're going to get a distribution. And then your performance objective should technically be defined also probabilistically in the sense that, so it's not defined that, okay, for this given worst case scenario, you should have, let's say, life safety. Life safety is always there, but further performance objectives such as building should be operational and so on. You have it in a probabilistic way. And then for a hazard with a given rate of return, the expected outcome or loss should be, you know, X. So, and you do this because it's just so much uncertainty involved the whole process. So that's why you try to actually capture that. I also observed that we often, when we don't have very good data, we keep adding margins of safety and they multiply by each other. You know, if you add in some steps of your analysis, I add a margin of safety to my fuel load. I add a margin on my evacuation. I add a margin on the structural performance. And all of this add together. And at the end, you don't even know what's the total margin of safety of your building, which can be actually enormous. And when we're talking about economic gains or benefit in the end for the client or for for the building is is by smart reduction of these safety margins that could potentially be unnecessary in a way so so i understand that good data is is somehow required to to start forward so you have your inputs you have for for your hazard analysis, you said there are four boxes. I'm going to reiterate them. Hazards, structures, then fragility, which is also damage, and then the fourth one, the last one, loss, the economic loss in that. So moving from just hazards to structures, what's happening there? So let me just connect the four boxes and then I'll go into the second box. This is more like a conditional probability type of thing. So that's why you kind of break them down. So you say now connecting the first two boxes, you say, well, how is this structure going to perform? So what's the probability of having the structure reaching, for example, such and such deflections, just making it up, given a hazard. So now let's say you have 1000 different scenarios coming out of the hazard box. But for each scenario, given that scenario, you can start looking at the structural analysis part of the problem. And that itself is not going to have one answer. Per scenario, you may have different outcomes, given the uncertainties that go into the structural analysis box. Now, here we are dealing with material properties. We are dealing with the applied load on the structure, you know, dead load, live load, and so on. And typically, I'm going to draw again a parallel line to earthquake engineering or other hazards. The material properties at ambient temperature, the uncertainty there compared to the uncertainty in the hazard, which for earthquake engineering is ground motion, is much smaller. So the uncertainty you get in ground motion is much higher. So it makes sense if you want to drop something, you would drop the material property uncertainties. For fire, it's not as easy as that because we actually have variation temperature. With temperature comes change in if you have steel yield strength, if you have concrete, if you have privacy, all that. Which, again, when we collected the data, there is a large variability. There's a large scatter in the data. So it's hard to drop that uncertainty. Another level of uncertainty going into the structural analysis within, again, fire, the first step is always heat transfer. Then you do structural analysis, right? So all the properties that go into the heat transfer analysis, such as thermal conductivity of your fire protection, and as well as your, again, steel, if you have steel or concrete, they all make a difference. We have done sensitivity analysis. And for example, one of the parameters that came out to make quite a difference, so it's hard to make that parameter deterministic, is again, thermal conductivity of the fire protection, which is a variable, at least at this stage, it's hard to know exactly what it is, again, thermal conductivity of the fire protection, which is a variable. At least at this stage, it's hard to know exactly what it is, which also changes with temperature. So one thing is to get the variable at ambient temperature from the producer, manufacturer of that material. Another thing is to actually know the variability with temperature, which there's not much data there. That's one thing. Another thing is it varies from material, you know, for different materials. So something that's hard to drop in this process and make it deterministic. We had similar experiences. Our colleague Piotr Stolkowski was on the show as well. He produced an internal book of basic properties and their change in temperatures that we're secretly using. And the same goes with a specific heater, I guess. It's very temperature dependent. So there are these funny things you have to start worrying about when you're doing a fire. One thing I was wondering, and I've read some of your papers before this interview, you've also done work on load modeling and how to define loads. And I found that very interesting, that loads are also something that's not the same over many buildings, right? Right, exactly. And actually that paper, Ruben Van Coyle was in that work. And the issue we were facing for that paper was that in the literature, there were different models with different assumptions. And what happened was that, again, in the literature, you know, we kept either referring to one or the other. So there were a number of papers referring to case A, a number of papers referring to case B. So we really, we weren't sure, okay, what's the right probabilistic model we should be using? So we just went into the background of those assumptions made. And Ruben and his student with the larger group, Thomas, Danny, Hopkins, student with the larger group, Thomas, Danny, Hopkins, we eventually arrived at a model that seemed to be most logical, given all the assumptions, again, behind these models. And it does definitely make a difference because I want to tie it back to one of our more recent studies. So in the US, we have prescriptive approach, right? And a lot not being applied. And we said, okay, let's say you've got a multi-story structure and you have all these columns across the building, and they're all designed based on a FI rating requirement. Now that we have all these models over years we've developed, let's quantify probability of reaching a limit state for all those columns across the building and see if we get similar probability. Because technically, if you want to have what I'm calling it harmonized safety, you shouldn't have a different probability of failure on the seventh floor versus the second floor, right? It's the same building. Or in the core versus the edge of it, right? Right, exactly. So we didn't vary much the assumptions on the hazard side because we were saying again that given, you know, whatever hazard inside a building, what's the probability? And as someone expected, the probability of failure actually varies across the building over the floors. So two things change from upper floors, let's say, to lower floors. One is the section factor or the size of the column, because as you go down, it gets heavier. And then the amount of applied load, because the bottom floors are collecting load. So you may have different utilization ratios for the column. So going back to the load effect, it makes a difference. And in the prescriptive approach, at least here in the US, it's not fully incorporated. That effect of the load is not fully incorporated. Therefore, you get various probabilities of failure across a building, which may not be something we want to have, but it is what it is. I mean, going just the descriptive way, you just have one safety, one assumed safety, and it doesn't say that you're safer on the seventh floor versus on the second floor. Well, it doesn't even explicitly say you're safe. It's just we assume you are once you follow that, right? Yes, indeed. Indeed. So that's why, I mean, we made a towards the end. I mean, that paper basically concluded that we are not saying exactly as you. We are not saying that this is safe or not. We are not criticizing, let's say, the prescriptor or creating an alarm that, okay, people, this is not safe. is not safe, but what we are advocating for is more harmonized safety in a sense that if you set the safety level, let's make sure that we have that level of safety all across in just one structure. I'm a huge advocate of that type of thinking because I also believe we are spending a lot on safety. I'm not saying we're spending too much on safety, but we are spending a lot and a huge chunk of a building goes into safety especially passive fire safety you know uh even the concrete you add over your rebar so you protect them from from being heated up these are the costs that add up and if there's a chance that this money could be spent in a better way to provide more safety why not that? Why spending it on stuff that does not matter when you could spend the money on stuff that matters? But to know that, you need to know that. You need to calculate that. And today we do not. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So with the structural analysis blocks, after you quantify all your uncertainties, you do your structural analysis using, again, choices up to the user. You either use finite element software, level of complexity, you go through that. But another important aspect is to decide how you want to characterize the response in a sense that what's coming out of that box? Are the forces in your elements? Is it the def box are the forces in your elements is it the deflection deformations in your elements is it for structural fine gene you can actually work with temperatures you know temperature in the rebar i don't know it's just the heat transfer part so you have to decide what parameter or parameters you will be using to characterize your structural response. We call these within, I'm borrowing the terminology from earthquake engineering, but I've been using it the same for structural fire engineering. We call them engineering demand parameters. So basically these are your demand parameters that move into the next box, which you will be using to quantify damage or fragility of the structure let's let's go there let's go there okay so with the damage the in simple you know terms when i say fragility again thinking about damage is okay you have a deformation that deformation um means what is the level of damage. Typically, borrowing in from other fields, we want to simplify the process in a way that you can communicate it easily. So you could have categories. Categories as in slight damage, moderate damage, severe damage, and maybe almost near collapse. So something like slight damage, it later on maps to, you know, next box. It basically means it comes with definition. So slight damage means you could potentially save for your occupants to go back and inside the structure and you don't have to spend much to repair it. And it could be also even just cosmetic repair and something like that. And then you move on to moderate damage. Well, it means that maybe it's not safe, right, for occupants to immediately go back, but it's repairable. You don't have to necessarily demolish. And then once you go into the severe or near collapse, then at that point, you're probably better off demolishing, rebuilding, rather than repairing because it's too much to repair. And again, these levels of damage are something you define for your particular building is not just saying that the crack of this size or something. However you could define it is moderate damage. It's related to your structure in use, its operations, right? Right. Yes, true. But it can be categorized for different structural systems. So in a sense that you could basically lump things together for certain categories so that it gives guidance for, again, the user. So if somebody is using it, they don't have to start from basically scratch. If you have a steel frame with a certain characteristic, maybe it's a brace system and composite floor system and so on, then you define these categories specifically for that. And high rise, like higher than a certain number of stories. I am going to completely put a twist here and just give an example. Let's say now you've got a tunnel because I've worked in that. Let's say now you've got a reinforced concrete tunnel liner. You can come up with these categories based on the level of, I don't know, the crown displacement. That means, okay, that probably, a certain level of deformation probably means certain crack widths. And that probably maps to a certain amount of repair requirement and so on. So that goes in the category of tunnels and certain lining type. So what we have actually in the seismic world, they have inventories or databases of what they call fragility functions. Okay. what they call fragility functions. Okay. And these fragility functions are basically developed for a suite of different structural types, structural elements, and they're all a function of, so it's important. So on the x-axis, you have some sort of an intensity measure or the engineering demand parameter, right? So that's where the engineering demand parameter comes into the picture. You say, given this amount of deflection, what's the probability? This is all probabilistic. What's the probability of exceeding a certain damage state? And those damage states are slight, moderate, severe, and so on. So instead of our, let's say, L30 criterion, which is sometimes used or it's often used, you would now have a probability function that says, okay, with this level of deflection, the severity is this. As it rises, it changes. Right, exactly. And again, what's important is that you pick an engineering demand parameter that reflects that level of damage. So you can't just pick any. You want to make sure that it actually maps to that level of damage. And then the seismic board, they use it the way that it happens. Let's say you have this fragility function for your connections, for your columns, for even, I'm going to go even a step further, they're trying, they're not there yet, but they're trying to develop all of these for non-structural components, right? Walls and so on. So once you have your hazard, then they go just do their structural analysis, then they end up with this third box. The user doesn't have to do the analysis for that specific case. They go to these reference fragility functions, and they start saying that, okay, now I know my deflection for column, horizontal deflection. I know some sort of parameter for temperature maybe in the connection, and so on. And then they look at what would be the level of damage. And then they make a conclusion that this building, maybe you've got a component that's in damaged state slight, but you've got a key component that has reached a severe damage state. Then most likely your structure overall is going to be in the severe damage state. So the user would go through the probabilistic analysis of the hazards, iterating through the scenarios, then going into the structural modeling, whatever model they choose to determine a certain parameter of their structure, which they can compare with now a standardized or pre-produced set of outcomes. Based on this value, they know the outcome would be like this. It's severe, not severe. And then based on this severity, they can figure out what to do. Well, I guess this is step four when they go into losses. Exactly. That's the part that as soon as you know your dump state, it maps to a repair cost and it maps to losses. Now, those losses, it definitely can go beyond economic losses, potential for casualties, societal causes, social causes, you name it. But it makes a direct connection there. So what I would say within structural fire engineering, the third box. I think fourth box is more or less outside of my area because that, again, brings in social aspects, economic aspects. So the third box is where perhaps I'm focusing on more now than the other boxes because I've been working on the first box then the second one so kind of moving now I'm in the third box trying to quantify damage for certain structures and one thing that in the past two or three years for example we don't have the answers yet we're still working it, and I think it probably takes another few years, is again that example of a tunnel lining reinforced concrete that I mentioned where, okay, we know that most likely it won't collapse based on the analysis, but it's all about the downtime of the tunnel. Because especially, again, in the U.S., you may not have a redundant route within the transportation network. So if you shut down the tunnel because there was a fire, how long is it going to take for the repair? And quantifying the damage, it's not as easy. Well, let me put it this way. We do not find a lot of literature and experimental data on what happens after cooling. Because if you are applying this, it's the structural fire engineering, you're not assuming a standard fire, right? You want to do this realistically, so you have this cooling phase, and you want to not only test during heating, but as well cooling, and let it cool down until it finds its new equilibrium, and now measure, okay, what's the deflection? What is the locked-in stresses? And so on. I love how you position it with tunnels. What you're describing here is what we call here resilience of the tunnel. And I actually had an episode with an engineer from Switzerland, Inger Reiss, about the resilience of tunnels. He was focused more on the use of active fire protection. In that, you're focusing more on structural performance of tunnels. But in the end, it's the same thing viewed from the inside and from the mountain side of the tunnel. Very, very interesting how both worlds go through each other. I think that this is a very interesting point of view. It is kind of generic to say, oh, we need to understand our structures better, or we need better way to measure the damage to take better informed decisions. Of course, we are. That's kind of obvious. But I love how here you're not just talking about that we need that. It's that you have a framework that can be adapted for that, a framework that allows you to work with. It's not a beautiful thought. It's a tool that you present here. So in the world of earthquake engineering, I guess there's probably more than 100 years of experience doing that. engineering, I guess there's probably more than 100 years of experience doing that. So, what's this type of thinking, this type of framework in the world of earthquake engineering? Did it go into the codes, into the law, into the standard? How widely it is used? Is it even possible to employ such a framework in the codified world we live in? Yeah, so the earthquake engineer will definitely as more advanced. And one of the perhaps, I would say, wake-up calls or when things change for them, it was after the 1994 Northridge earthquake in the US in California. And there were a number of buildings did not perform as they had thought or wished for. So they started making really significant changes. And right now, at this stage, the performance-based design, you can definitely come up with many, many, many buildings, let's say on the West Coast of the U.S., that they're built, high-rise structures built using performance-based design. So one thing that I want to mention is perhaps, given that, again, it's uncertain and all the variability that you get and going through this procedure, it's not that if you follow performance-based design, you say that, okay, with 100% certainty, this is going to happen. Because still, they don't know also, and they acknowledge that. And they also argue that maybe what they build necessarily is not, because they also have their own simplified or prescriptive approach that they can follow. Nothing stops them. The argument is they hope, and I believe this is true, I mean, that using this approach, they are going to get buildings that perform better or to the level that they have calculated. So they get some sort of, we use the term safety, that they're comfortable with. Now, what they are moving, again, far from where we are, and it perhaps may not necessarily directly apply to structural fire engineering, but they have reached a level that they believe they've solved the collapse prevention problem, in the sense that what they build is not going to collapse. And they are really pushing for immediate occupancy, in the sense that now they say, okay, a lot of that economic losses after an earthquake across the region is going to be because people cannot go back because of the downtime and everything. And the downtime, I'm relating it to, again, to the tunnel project because that's the motivation there as a single structure versus many buildings across the region after an earthquake. But they think that, okay, now that we've solved collapse prevention, let's move on to work on non-structural components and make sure that we can have occupants or minimize the functional recovery, what they call. So they want to be able to optimize that functional recovery. Now, within fire engineering world, if you have a fire inside the building, no matter what, you still need to clean it up. In terms of the furniture, in terms of, again, non-structural components and things like that. So that directly doesn't map to what we do. components and things like that. So that directly doesn't map to what we do. But if you really have a structure that's critical, that has a certain essential service that you want to be able to recover quickly, then you can at least work on the structural components from my perspective, structural engineering aspect of it, to make sure that you stay within that damage state one or two where you can repair it, rather than you have to basically demolish and rebuild. I think in fire, what's different from the earthquake is that the fire is localized, even within your building. It doesn't necessarily affect the whole building. localized even within your building, it doesn't necessarily affect the whole building. And you may be quite okay with, like, let's say losing or having one fire compartment destroyed if your building is compartmentalized, but having the functionality of the rest of the building undisturbed. Yeah. So, like, what you don't want to have is, like, some sort of progressive collapse or some sort of damage to the whole that's, in a way, unnecessary. In Earthquake, I guess it's an event that touches the whole building. So if you have lightweight walls, it's going to destroy them in every floor. So you're worried more maybe on this aspect. In fire, we have ways to mitigate that. But again, going back to the thing that triggered this discussion, we don't know how much we have. We have absolutely no idea to what fire will cause what sort of damage and what you propose in theories. Another way to look into that, that could finally give us this answer that I believe we desperately need. I also liked how you've placed it so you can build a catalog of the losses. Right. I think also like going, applying this methodology to some set of standardized or typical buildings can reveal their functionality. Even applying this method to structures that are codified, like following the prescriptive codes, it could unravel their ultimate level of safety. Definitely. That would be a funny thing to have. So I really see a lot of implementation of frameworks like the one that you've proposed. And for the end, to highlight the probabilistic aspect, and in earthquake engineering, I assume they work with targets that are also tied to probabilities, right? Yes, yes. It's a 2% probability of collapse for an earthquake with a return period of X, you know, such and such. So both of the terms, so the hazard return period as well as the chance of collapse, they're specified in a probabilistic term. So the methodology starts with probabilistic set of scenarios, likelihoods, which are tied to probabilistic ventilation factors, fuel load densities, all the aspects that drive the growth of the fire. The loads on the building itself could be probabilistic. Then you go through structural modeling with some sort of, let's say, conditional probabilities that scenarios that have certain probabilities that lead to certain engineering demand parameters that can translate into fragility damage and then losses. I got it right, I hope. Yeah, you definitely got it right. Perfect. The one thing I want to mention quickly, another thing that sort of, it's an assumption that goes into this procedure, but it works, is that you assume that the variables in this analysis, going from one box to another, they're, from a probabilistic point of view, they're conditionally independent. But when you're in one box, you're just in that box and you're not dependent. You are dependent, but in terms of you can assume that, okay, given a hazard, now what? You have a set of different branches in the chain. So you don't have to go back and forth but which makes it easier for application in a sense that you don't have to have to be an expert in all four boxes you can rely on someone whose focus is on hazard analysis right here? Here's your problem statement. Here's the building or whatever the tunnel, whatever the structure is. Can you do me a hazard analysis and give me a suite of potential scenarios? Then maybe I'm a structural analysis. I really don't know. I know how fire works because I'm a structural fire engineer and all of that. But at the end of the day, I'm maybe not comfortable using a CFD or whatever, so I ask somebody else to do it, give me the output, then I use that as an input. So breaking it up, even within that probabilistic approach, it gives you the opportunity to bring in experts where you need them in whatever box. And essentially what you need from them is an output plus probability of that output and then you're good. I really enjoy it. I'm doing a lot of projects on wind and fire engineering at the moment. I think in wind and fire it's a little more complicated because if you want to do it right you have to get the feedback. I cannot have a set of fires and then apply a set of winds to them because the wind will completely change the fire. So wind and fire are now in my one box that is a set of branches. So every scenario is dictated by two probabilities. One is the wind and the second is the fire. But the structure could be the same. You're giving me a lot of ideas how to how to structurize my my thinking in this regard because if it's not structurized it's not going to work not to deviate but just to get a parenthesis because something that i've got involved recently is application of exactly these boxes and this framework to communities and wildfire okay very different sort of problem because it's not not just a single structure now it's a community because it doesn't make sense for wildfires to have one structure that's wildfire because everything else will still get burned down but um thinking about wildfires uh i just don't have the knowledge. Maybe if I study, yes, but I do not have the knowledge to simulate wildfires in the wildland. And you brought up the wind, which is pretty much, you know, wind modeling inside the community, outside the community is part of the problem. But if somebody else gives me the wildfire scenario as it approaches the community, I can take that. fire scenario as it approaches the community, I can take that. And then if somebody else gives me the wind field and velocity over time, I can also take that. And then I can run my simulation, which is basically fire spread within the community, and then move that into, again, the damage box and so on. So again, same sort of thinking and framework, now a completely different problem. That's what I love about fire science. There is no unrelated topics to discuss. What has been 40-something minutes of discussion on structural fire engineering, now with this one tiny twist, someone who's doing wildfire research can say, oh, okay, that's directly applicable to them, and it's directly applicable to my wind engineering studies. So thank you very much. That has been very useful. I really enjoyed this. I love the structure. I love how it is a framework. It's not a nice thought. It's not a philosophical discussion. It is a tool. I didn't know it is a tool before this discussion, so I'm very happy you helped me discover it is a tool. I didn't know it is a tool before this discussion, so I'm very happy you helped me discover it is a tool. So I guess that's it. Now, before we part ways, maybe if someone would like to learn more about that, any resources you could recommend to learn more? I'm going to leave the fuel load paper in the show notes and the review of practice to the leaf load modeling, maybe there's more. Yes, we do have papers as well on material models. I can definitely send them to you. First paper on the topic, which again adopts the idea from earthquake engineering, is actually by Professor David Lang and Professor Asif Osmani and Dr. Sean Devaney. And if I'm not mistaken, the title of the paper was an application of the peer performance-based earthquake engineering framework to structures in FHIR. That goes back in 2014. So it basically lays out, you know, these steps, right? The way that I describe them as boxes, but they have like a figure and they say, okay, you go from here to here and so on. So I'll definitely send you that paper as well because that, within I think our community that set the tone for this procedure. And I'll take a look at my publications. If there's anything relevant, I'll send it to you. Fantastic. And I also had, actually, as you mentioned, David, I had an episode with David and Jaime Cadena Gomez, who was doing maximal global damage method. So I guess they covered the fourth box with losses. Yeah, fantastic. So all of it ties together. Super thankful for this interview. I hope people found it interesting. It's advanced structural fire engineering. I know in many places we're not there yet even with just structural fire engineering. But I think that's a very promising future, and it's fantastic to learn what you can achieve and what you can do with these advanced methods. So if someone chooses to go for them, they have a better understanding of what they get, what the benefits are, and what it can bring to a project. So, Nagar, thank you very much for this. It was a fantastic talk. Thank you so much for having me. It was a fantastic talk. Thank you so much for having me. It was great being here on this podcast. And just a final note, I'm teaching course on structures and fire here at Buffalo. And as part of the course, you know, the students have a project. They have to do case studies and read about it and come back and I'll be assigning, not my own podcast, other podcasts, the other ones, I'm going to assign them to listen to your podcast and come back and provide summaries and things they've learned from the podcast. So thank you for doing this. You are contributing to my students here at UB. Fantastic. I hope they enjoy it and get something out of it. If they don't let me know, that means I have to get new episodes coming. No, thank you so much. Thanks. Cheers. And that's it. As promised, a little bit complicated, maybe a little bit difficult. Definitely a stop up from just structural fire engineering, but a very natural concept in the end, if you think about the nature of fires and the nature of safety to view these true probability scenarios, damage, and in the end, the possible loss that can be the result of the damage. So I believe this probabilistic framework that are shown can be applied to many places in fire engineering, like in the end of the podcast episode, we discussed how she's applying that to wildfire communities and wildfire preparedness. I believe that's brilliant. I already see how I can apply this to my wind and fire coupled modeling. So I really enjoyed listening about this tool. I must say I've never heard about this approach or this structure of an approach to probabilistic fire engineering. And I'm very happy I did learn it. And I hope some of you have learned something new along me today. Thank you very much for listening to today's episode. As I've mentioned in the intro to this episode, I see a lot of new people in the podcast. I see a lot of listeners around. So let me take this opportunity to ask you for leaving me some five-star reviews on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or you can leave a review directly on my webpage. on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or you can leave a review directly on my webpage. These reviews are tremendously helpful to the growth of the podcast because they heavily influence the search algorithms in the internet. And as you know, search rules everything. So by leaving me a review, you're highly improving somebody's chance to stumble upon this show that may be useful to them. I hope that. And also, as I've noticed through my survey, word of mouth is number one tool to grow the podcast. So if you can pass the knowledge about this podcast to your friends and colleagues, I will certainly appreciate that because that helps me affect more engineers worldwide. And that's some sort of my goal. So thank you very much for sharing the podcast. If you find it useful, please do so. And that's it for today's episode. Thank you for the great month of January. I'm still looking for questions for Q&A of January. I don't have too many. So if you wish to ask me a question, please do so. You can do that through the speak pipe on the website or you can send me an email. And I'll try to answer that or find someone who can answer that on my behalf. The Q&A episode will be published more or less after 8th of February. That's not a coincidence. 8th of February is the deadline for IFSS paper submission. So if you're a fire scientist, I guess you have a very similar deadline as I do in this regard. Anyways, thank you very much for being here. See you here next Wednesday. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
