 Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm here today all on my own, recording a solo episode for you on some topics from my own expertise. Actually, I can spoil it already, we're going to talk about smoke control in shopping malls and all interesting things that happen to the smoke between the point where it's released to the point where it's extracted from the building. into the smoke between the point where it's released to the point where it's extracted from the building. And I forgot how hard it is to record sort of episodes, so I hope you appreciate and like this one. Because I'm here doing this on my own, I don't have to introduce someone, so I may as well just take some of your time to update you on the state of the project, the Fire Science Show podcast. So I'm very, very happy how the thing is developing. I just had a very nice month in September with a record amount of downloads, 4,000 downloads in one month. That's a lot, guys. Thank you very much for sharing the episodes and listening to it and growing attention to the podcast. I have received some very interesting reviews and comments. They've actually pushed me into top 5% of the world's podcast. So thank you very much for that. And I appreciate, as I said many times, your reviews are paramount to the growth of the show and the way how it is perceived by algorithms. So I'm very, very thankful to you. But on top of that, I just really love to hear from all of you. What do you think about the podcast? What does it mean for you? How do you listen to it? I read all of them. They usually make my day. I had people telling me how the podcast helped them come back to the work. I had mothers who listened to it while walking their children. That's amazing. I had mothers who listened to it while walking their children. That's amazing. I had people who listened to the podcast while running, and it seemingly makes them run farther away because episodes are so long, I guess. Now I probably should record even longer ones. I never thought I would have an active part in developing someone's physical fitness. So, yeah, thanks for that, Daniel. You absolutely made my day. My most favorite one was actually later. A technician in the fire laboratory told me that they do listen to the podcast when doing cone calorimeter tests, and that it inspired them to actually pursue a career in fire safety engineering. And really, wow, that's amazing. I got your back. Go for it. It's worth it. and listening to the podcast while doing cone calorimetry that is that is a great use of time to be honest learning fire science while doing fire science so thank you thank you very much it's very inspirational to read all of this and makes me very very happy to hear that you're happy with the show and if you're unhappy with the show, that probably will not make me happy, but I probably should know that so also you can tell me. In the recent time, I've also been connecting to some other fire podcasters. I've met Kevin Soffen from Smart Firefighting, a great guy. He's doing very interesting panels online. I've been to one recently. It was a very interesting event. I've just met Chris Logan of Firesprinkler Podcast. That's probably the biggest Firesprinkler Podcast there is around. Also a great guy and it seems we may be capable of doing some mutual projects together. So you'll probably hear Chris in here. You'll probably hear me in his podcast and I'm very looking forward to that. I also would like to give a shout out to Farco Teh and Guz Gagliardi. I've been in his show multiple times. I've recently, like two months ago, I've talked about the Fire Science show in there. So if you haven't heard that, it's probably interesting to hear some background stories about the podcast. And I must say that Guz just published a very nice and comprehensive list of online resources for fire engineers. So I'll definitely link to that in the show notes. You should definitely check it out. And you mentioned Fire Science Show as his favorite podcast. So, yeah, thanks, Gus. I appreciate that a lot. Okay, so as you see, the podcast is going great. I hope you enjoy listening. I see it growing. I invite new people, just send another great batch of invites to very interesting people around. Many of them replied already. Talks are scheduled. Much more interesting content is coming your way soon. So look forward for that. And for today, I hope to provide you some interesting and beneficial content on my own. So I wanted to take you to something that was very dear to my heart, still is probably, that is design of smoke control in complex buildings. Actually, the story of this episode is quite funny, maybe. I'm a person that's very into journaling stuff. I write in notebooks. I write notes. I write memos. I plan out pieces of research that I would like to write. And I must say it helped me a lot in my career, actually, to do that journaling. I recommend it to anyone to keep a track of their thoughts because otherwise they're lost. Anyway, it's not a point of writing, but you also have to revisit these things. And I was recently revisiting an old notebook from somewhere like 2016, many, many years ago, where I was pursuing my PhD on smoke control in shopping malls, on the effects of architecture, the impact of architecture on smoke flow and how different arrangements of architecture can change the parameters of smoke exhaust systems. But then we were shortly after writing our short book on car park ventilation for a Polish market, and I had this memo that maybe I should write a book on smoke control in shopping malls. Because it's a complicated matter, actually. It's a very, very complicated matter. in shopping malls. Because it's a complicated matter, actually. It's a very, very complicated matter. If you want to do a really good performance-based engineering project in a shopping mall, there is a lot of things that you have to think about. Way, way beyond just having a certain value of extraction rate and distribute it in the mall. I mean, it can get the job done. The question is, have you done the cheapest technology to pursue the goal that you were for? And are there any traps that you have not thought about? And often that's the case. Both are the cases. Usually the systems are not very optimal if you just take one analytical method and calculate the extraction rate and then just without much thought to just implement it. So today I would love to share with you some thoughts from that time, enhanced by the next six years of experience that I've gained. So back then I was involved in many smoke control projects in shopping malls. I think with my team we've delivered six or seven very large shopping malls in Poland in terms of design of the smoke control systems. Now we do much less of that because we've specialized in tunnels last year, but still we're involved in some refurbishment projects of modern malls. There's also not that money being built from scratch in Poland nowadays, so that also the landscape has changed a bit. But still, it's interesting projects, and what I'm going to talk about today does not only cover shopping malls, but it's also very relevant if you design a railway station, airport, actually any mixed-use, large-volume building where you would have a common smoke reservoir from which you would like to extract smoke. So, okay, so that was an absolutely long introduction to the podcast episode. So let's jump into the knowledge that I wanted to share with you. So I've identified seven things I would love to talk about when thinking about designing smoke control in a shopping mall, let's say in a common mall, like a situation in which the fire is in some sort of compartment or directly within the mall and the smoke is meant to fly into that mall and be extracted from it so not a situation in which you would have a local smoke control in a shopping unit and you would like to keep the smoke in the shop precisely opposite situation where you would like to release the smoke into the mall and safely extract it from that place, that's very precisely opposite situation where you would like to release the smoke into the mall and safely extract it from that place that's very very possible obviously it's much related to the size of the shop from which you do this extraction that's probably the the first thing to mention like what kind of shops you can or what kind of compartments you can safely ventilate through a common space, through a mall. And there are some guidelines. Some of them say 1,300 square meters. Some guidelines say 900 square meters. I think there is no really singular value of what kind of compartment you can safely ventilate through a common space. It's difficult to just give a number in square meters because there's always the problem what if the thing is one square meter above the dimension. We always get into arguments with investors and designers like what happens in that situation. Well, as a common rule, we usually go with 800 to 900 square meters as the maximum we are very comfortable with extracting through mole. The shape and length of the compartment also matters a lot. So if the shape is complicated, it may be very difficult to actually extract the smoke. We even defined a very robust definition of what it means that the shape is complicated. So you probably remember the old game tetris the blocks falling from the sky and disappearing when you when you merge them uh so if you can just define the shape of a compartment with one of the blocks from original tetris it means the shape is quite simple if you cannot then it is complicated and this rule rule of thumb has served us very well till now. So, yeah, we know now what situation we're talking about, a compartment that is being ventilated through a common space, a mall. Now, question number one that you need to ask yourself, why am I doing that even? What's the point of smoke control in this arrangement? Am I caring about life safety? Malls can be tricky, especially that I'm not sure how it's designed in your countries, but in Poland, you would usually have some sort of food court area or recreation areas on the upper levels of the mall. You would usually have cinemas and stuff like that in upper levels of the mall, not really shops. So you would have a situation where people would be less mobile. Maybe they would be sitting eating. They would be probably quite busy and there's a good chance there would be a lot of people in the top level of the mall. So life safety is not trivial in there. You need to have a capacity to evacuate these people. You need to have a capacity to alarm them about the fire. Especially if the fire can occur far away from them and they still can be affected by the smoke flowing through the mall if you gather it underneath the roof of the mall. So the people on the top level are usually the ones you worry about the most if you're considering life safety. So that would be one very strong design goal. Another one would be to limit the extent of how far the smoke goes into the mall so you reduce the damage, which it's not about damage, actually. I mean, if the shopping mall gets damaged, they will get money back from the insurers and it will be all right in the end. But it means parts of it will be closed. And this sort of resiliency of the building is very important nowadays. You want to have business continuity. You want to be able to use the building as it is supposed to be used as quickly after a fire as possible. So actually designing a very robust smoke control system is a way to provide that. You will be able to start the operations back to normal quicker. If you have good smoke control, then if you have a bad small control, if you have none, maybe your goal is to fulfill legislation. Then you have to ask yourself a question. Am I pursuing some better goals or I just want to be done with my system? Maybe just a simple, robust calculation from NFPA 92 or some 12.1.1.5. The European standard is just enough to get your thing passed and maybe you don't need to go into expensive performance-based engineering process for this design. Maybe all you need is just a simple system. That may be a goal and it's a very valid goal. Many objects where we were involved with, the smoke control would be designed for this particular purpose. To take a box where if you have smoke control, you can build a larger fire compartment, which is very attractive for owners of the mall. Maybe you have some complicated geometry. Maybe you have underground levels where you have mall areas. Maybe you have some parts of the building that you cannot ventilate through large smoke reservoirs in the mall itself. That also happens quite often in the projects we've met. So you will also have very significant challenges with life safety in these places, which would need your increased attention. But you need to understand that you cannot go into the project without understanding what you are doing the project for even if it's just to have one piece of smoke exhaust to take a box that's also a goal and you also need to be aware of that because that will drive many of your design decisions second thing on my list what fire are you dealing with that's not a very trivial question actually quite difficult difficult to answer. If I'm honest with you, we would usually go with some design fires that are listed in 12.1.1.5, which can be traced back to BRE 368, I think was the number, written by Morgan. Magnificent piece of fundamental literature for an smoke control engineer. I highly recommend reading that. fundamental literature for an smoke control engineer, I highly recommend reading that. That's like 20 some years old, but still very interesting thing to read and very comprehensive summary of the knowledge in fire. But you really need to understand how design fire will change your system. You're basically dimensioning against that fire, the size of the fire, when and where the fire is positioned. We're going to talk about architecture later in the episode, but the fire itself, if you have two and a half megawatt, if you have five megawatts, if you have 10 megawatts, three completely different fires, three completely different outcomes, three completely different fire plumes, you need to understand which you have and why you've picked it. And I sometimes see we jump into this design fire loophole or something. We just pick one from the list without comprehending. Is it really possible in this particular setting? If you have a mall stand where they sell mattresses and you have a small shop where they sell cupcakes, it's obvious that fire threat in both of these places will be completely different. You have a bookstore, it's different. You have a jewelry shop, it's different. It's important to understand the consequences of each of those. However, you also must understand that a mall is a living thing. The fact that today there's a jewelry shop in this particular corner of the shopping mall doesn't mean that there will not be a shop with mattresses in 10 years. And your smoke control will be as good as it is when you design it. So you need to have this in your mind that buildings live and change. You have to really focus on choosing really robust design fire and i'm usually a fan of actually going into a little bigger design fires to really test my systems against them and optimize them for that and this usually in the years after we design a shopping mall now we have this experience because some of the malls we have originally designed, they would come back to us and people would be doing some changes in them. And they usually are very happy to find out that nothing must be done with the smoke control system because it was designed with really good design fires in mind. And what we've done many years ago already covers the new scope of use. If you push for small fires, a common case would be someone considering let's say a medium growth fire and having sprinklers and say that sprinklers activate after i don't know 150 seconds so this design fire is cut down to 700 kilowatts or whatever the value would be at the point and just go with that That may not be sufficient if you want a robust system in the future. So, yeah, choosing DesignFire, that's an art for sure. That's probably one or maybe many podcast episodes that need to be recorded on how to choose that. It's not simple, but it's the foundation of your design and probably the most important, most impactful thing that you have in your mall. The second most impactful thing would be architecture. There are so many architectural features of the mall, of the building, that impact how much smoke you will have to deal with, what's the threat in your building. It's actually astounding to what extent architecture affects it. That was something i wanted to test in my pg take a deep look into in my in my research i was astounded with the variety of outcomes i've achieved with just differing the architecture having the same fire pretty much same mall just playing with the balcony downstands the distances, the size of the openings in the shopping fronts. All of this together has tremendously changed the resulting dimensioning of the systems that I was working with. I have one paper in English from my PhD. Not very much. I was not a very prolific researcher back then. Probably today I would push much more papers out of such a research, but I just have one, and I'll link that in the show notes if you would like to look further, deeper into that research. Now, when you consider architecture, there are some very impactful architectural details of the building that would be very strong drivers of the dimensioning of your smoke control and the performance of the smoke control. One would be balconies, projecting balconies above the mall, so the smoke must exit. Let's imagine a fire in a shop. You have fire, the smoke is generated in that shop. Because you don't have individual smoke control in that shopping unit, the smoke must be extracted into the mall. So it will flow through an opening in the shop front. And then it will either fly undisturbed to the top of the mall, or it will fly underneath a balcony. And there's a lot of things happening when the smoke flies underneath the balcony. Imagine it has to change its flow direction at least three times. So it must change direction when it exits the shop. So it must flow through the doors underneath the downstands. Then it must flow horizontally underneath the balcony. And then it must flow vertically up again when it reaches the end of the balcony. So every time a smoke changes its direction, there's a significant mixing of smoke and surrounding air happening. And that leads to increased amount of smoke that you have to extract. Every time smoke moves, you have more smoke. That's the thing with smoke control. That's the problematic thing with smoke control. Every time it moves, you have more of it to extract. And because you need a very, very little amount of soot or smoke in smoke to make it obscure visibility and break your durability criteria you cannot really dilute it to a point where it's not a threat anymore so you always just end up with one more smoke and what's worse you end up with a smoke that is cold so there's not much you can do about it if the smoke is cold if it its buoyancy, you have a problem because it's very difficult to drive it to places where you want it to be driven. Now, as the smoke moves, as you change the amount of the smoke in smoke plumes, we reach an interesting paradigm. That's an underlying paradigm of the design of smoke control that we have. How do you choose how much extraction do you need to remove that smoke? We assume that the smoke is being produced in the fire. We have our models, be it axis symmetric smoke plumes or spill plumes for moles, in which you can calculate the amount of smoke produced, smoke as the mixture of the fire smoke and the untrained air that is mixed with it. You calculate how much mass is that, and you have an answer. You assume that if you extract as much smoke as you produce, you're good. That's a working system. So we use this paradigm to design our smoke control. We basically find equilibrium between the amount of air extracted and the amount of smoke produced in the system. For extraction, you have two possibilities. You can extract it with mechanical means, so with mechanical ventilators, where you basically have a powered device that extracts a certain volume of smoke. It's very important to understand that extraction fans are volumetric machines. They always remove the same volume, which means they remove a varying mass of smoke, because smoke has temperature. Temperature affects density, density affects the mass flow. So, you always remove the same volumetric capacity, but the mass flux will change in the powered ventilator. And you can use natural ventilators, which use the smoke buoyancy to extract the smoke from the building outside. We extensively work with natural ventilators. As you maybe heard in episode 50, we do a lot of wind engineering, and wind engineering was largely related to natural smoke control. So how wind conditions affect the ventilators and oh boy, we're in trouble in here. The way how we design natural ventilators is not very robust or doesn't really have huge physical meaning because of how industry is tweaked towards a very specific parameter of a single ventilator called the discharge coefficient or aerodynamic free area and this parameter is in the end very very weak predictor of the performance of natural ventilator on a real building but boy that that's a separate podcast episode and i promise i'll i'll deliver that i can rant on that for hours and i promise i'll i will do that in the show. So you have ventilators powered, natural ones that extract a certain amount of smoke and know how much smoke goes in there. As mentioned, axisymmetric plumes, spill plumes, there are models. They usually correlate the amount of smoke to the parameters of the fire, either its heat release rate or convective heat release rate and value so-called virtual origin, so the height in which a triangle representing fire would start underneath the ground. I'm really bad at describing that, but there exists such a thing as virtual fire origin and it's used in many plume models. In some models, you just use the parameter of the fire. It's also a valid approach. And from these parameters of fire, you have the first value of your mass flow. Then you usually rely on the height difference between the plane at which the fire is and the height at which you want your smoke layer to be. And there are some additional coefficients for the flow through openings, floor, flow underneath downstands, flow underneath balconies, that help you approximate the mass flow that's in the end of your system. So many coefficients, many assumed variables, not that much science in that. So you must understand that these correlations are usually best fits to a certain set of experiments carried in the past. So what we have today are basically results of some experiments run in the 80s and scientists trying to fit some sort of curve to the results of this experiment and then translate it into some sort of empirical relation that correlates the amount of smoke to the height on which the air is entrained into the smoke plume. So that's what we have. I'm not sure if these models are perfect, if these models are really great. And we usually can optimize much further than the analytical models with CFD, with advanced tools. So I highly recommend that. I don't know how popular is that in your country, but here we would not do a project without CFD with advanced tools. So I highly recommend that. I don't know how popular is that in your country, but here we would not do a project without CFD. It's just how we do it. We would always run CFD calculations for a mall. So it's definitely a way that's very helpful to achieve optimized solutions. I highly recommend that. If it's not being used in your country, write me. I can help you find resources and learn how to do that. Maybe we can change the mind of your country to approach performance-based engineering in smoke control. We were very lucky in Poland to have this written in our law, that we are allowed to do performance-based engineering. And since then, it's been magic. We were able to really design our systems, not just read the number from the code. The fourth thing I wanted to talk about, I just said that the amount of smoke in the smoke room would be a result of the fire in the compartment and the flow out of that compartment. So let's touch that. Let's touch the exits of the shopping units, the shopping fronts and openings in that. And it was one of the most interesting and frustrating finding of my PhD. So that's a story, story time. If you go the traditional way, you would like to, let's say you would like to optimize your system for costs, for money. So you would like to end up with the smallest system you can have. As I said, we live in a paradigm where the mass of smoke flowing into the smoke reservoir equals the mass of smoke extracted with your ventilators so what's the optimization color you want to have as low mass of smoke flowing as possible now you look at the equations and you may find it amount of mass exiting the shop, not in all methods, but in some of the methods, is related to the size of the opening. So if you make a larger opening, you have more smoke. If you have a smaller opening, you have not that much smoke. So a clever engineer would say, okay, let's do the openings as small as possible. This way we reduce the amount of smoke that is being extracted to the mall, and thus we can design a smaller system. That's a very clever optimization based on the assumptions of the standards. Now, I was testing this in my PhD, and I very quickly realized that this relation of the amount of smoke produced in a compartment to the size of the opening is not very valid. It doesn't hold infinitely. So you could assume that the bigger the opening, the bigger the amount of smoke extracted, right? So what happens if you have a 100-meter-long opening or 500-meter-long, where you have infinite amount of smoke? Well, no, there's conservation of mass and energy in the fire, that there's not enough energy produced in the fire to move that much air so actually it flattens out at some point where no matter how much bigger your opening is you will not produce more smoke through that opening it will just flow from the opening with a slower velocity essentially meaning there's less entrainment and in the end it flattens out it i could observe that in my PhD and it was one of the main findings of that. Very interesting finding. Now I've also observed the second thing. If you have a shopping unit and the exit from that shop, the opening to the mall is very small, you basically trap all the smoke inside that shopping unit creating very bad untenable conditions in that compartment very quickly. But if you really had a large opening, especially if you had a very tall opening, you could really release most of the smoke to the mall, from which you can safely extract it, maintaining stratification of the smoke layers inside the compartment, and providing conditions inside that almost match conditions in ventilated compartments. Of course, that holds for warm smoke. So if you have a very robust sprinkler system and it just extinguishes the firewall, then you have no smoke, you win. There are things that I have not taken into account when doing my PhD, but still, if I used larger openings, I got better results. I got safer system and not much bigger system in the end, but safer system. Contrary to what you would find just blindly following standards and making conclusions on how variables are input into analytical calculations. So this is also something I urge you to think out of the box and try to seek solutions that may not necessarily be ones directly resulting from the standard. Next thing, fifth or maybe the sixth thing, I've lost my count in here, is the way how you supply the makeuper into your shopping mall. Boy, that is a challenge. I always say it's putting more extraction in a shop is not a big problem. You just put one more fan later on the roof and you have more exhaust. It's usually very easily doable. It's just a matter of money and power. However, to put more air into the mall, that's a huge challenge. And usually we have more problems with supplying air than extracting it. Why is that? We need low-velocity flows in moles. As I mentioned, the smoke has buoyancy. As long as it flies up, you can pick it up wherever you need to pick it up and extract. If it's cold, it does not have buoyancy. It flows everywhere. It mixes everywhere. It stays at the level that it mixed. You cannot do anything with such a mixture. You quickly lose visibility conditions in your mall. You have people exposed to smoke, something you really do not want to do when designing smoke control. So having a really good, robust air supply is critical. Now, main question is, with what velocity the air can be supplied into the mall? And boy, that's a challenge. Some guidelines will tell you one meter per second, some will tell two, some will tell three. My experience is that two is already a lot. Two meters per second is already a lot and it already leads to problems with mixing the air and smoke layers in shopping malls. So I would definitely recommend below two. People don't recognize that kinetic energy is within the power of two of velocity. So having a little quicker air is actually, you put much more kinetic energy, you put much stronger flow into your building that must stop somewhere before it mixes with the smoke. So it's paramount to have flow introduced to your compartment as slow as possible. And that requires a lot of openings, which you usually do not have. The worst is when they tell you to compartmentalize your shopping mall into smaller fire compartments and suddenly you may end up with part of the mall that even doesn't have a connection to outside through external doors. That's horrible to work with. I usually try to avoid that at all costs and I would prefer one giant fire compartment with a controllable air supply rather than very high compartment-sized shopping mall with no way to introduce makeup air. It will be much worse. The large fire compartment, contrary to what colleagues from fire departments say, the large fire compartment, contrary to what colleagues from fire departments say, in my opinion, it would be a much, much safer building than one compartmentalized heavily, from the perspective of life safety, of course, not from the maximum damage that the fire can do to the building. From that perspective, of course, most likely compartmentalization would be, or maybe it would not. Maybe you should apply risk methods. You've learned about them in the podcast. Another clever use of risk to judge that. Probably no other better way to do that. So, so far from the things I wanted to share, we had the size of the compartment that we can safely ventilate to a common mall. We had choosing the goal of your smoke control. We had choosing the size of the fire and the impact of the design fire on the design of smoke control. We have talked about how the architecture influences the flow of smoke, whether to shape of the mall balcony openings between the shopping mall levels. We call them voids. These are actually very important. How you shape them, how many is there, how big they are related to the size of the mall, how shopping fronts will influence that, how we calculate the mass fluxes in the shopping mall, and how do we supply air. The important aspects of designing smoke control besides just choosing an extraction rate while you're locating your powered or natural bands on the roof many many things that go into a design but now for a final thing let's say you've done a great job let's say you've designed a really flawless smoke control system how do you know that it's built to your expectations on the building that's something we also learned the hard way after designing many systems then having ability to go to the mall, do hotspot tests, see how it performs and pick up so many weak points. Sometimes in the design, I'm not claiming our design is always flawless. We're constantly learning and improving. It usually is quite good. I must say I'm proudly about myself and my team. But we sometimes make mistakes, of course. Most of the time, the mistakes are somewhere between the design and execution. Maybe someone plugged the device incorrectly. Maybe someone programmed the thing incorrectly. Maybe someone has mistaken the direction. Maybe there should be a smoke curtain installed, but it's not there. Maybe it's just not operational. Maybe something is not powered. Maybe something is in maintenance mode. Maybe some of your smoke control damper has broken. They do that all the time. So there's so many tiny things that can affect the final performance of your system that needs to be checked before the building is delivered. affect the final performance of your system that needs to be checked before the building is delivered. If you want to be sure that your building is delivered as you designed it, it must be tested and verified. And from my own experience and experience of my team, no better way than hot smoke tests. I've had a podcast episode about that with some Polish colleagues. It's Marcin Paliszczak from Inbepo company in Poland. As ITB, we also do these tests. I think at this point we've done something like 1,300 individual hot smoke tests in more than 150 buildings. So it's a pretty decent body of experience of testing real buildings. Colleagues from Inbepo also have done them in hundreds. So a collective experience of two very experienced bodies in Poland that run these tests, and we run these tests not for the purpose of verifying if smoke flows upwards and if smoke extraction really works, but we do this in particular to check how the automation of the building reacts to fire. Is it as we expected it to be? It's very important. It usually is not, unfortunately. But this Hotspot Test approach really allows you to pick these errors and fix them. That's the most important thing. You can fix them very easy. And in the episode about Hotspot Tests, which I link in the show notes, you can learn all about it. If you have not heard that episode, it's a really great follow-up to this episode. So here you go. There are important things that go into design of small control system. I hope you've enjoyed this list of stuff to consider. I must say in recent discussions with some colleagues, I rarely see these things being discussed. I very rarely hear discussion about the impact of architecture or the make-up strategy or the way how you shape a shopping front on the behavior of smoke control in the mall. People usually focus on how much extraction, how much cubic feet per minute, as my colleagues in the US like to measure that. You have to extract to have a system and we just throw numbers over numbers. And of course, it's important. It's a factor in the design. It's the defining factor of how much money you will spend on an installation. But you can be smart about if you can touch some other aspects of your building, like the architecture, maybe you can put a smoke curtain somewhere that will direct smoke into a better path. Maybe you can reduce the threat by defining what types of shops can be placed in a certain location of the mall and that is imposed in the building guidance book and will be maintained through the life of the building. That's a pretty decent way to reduce the design fire and make sure that actually design fire is applicable for whatever happens with the building in the future. There are many, many clever ways in which you can alter the smoke control of a mall or large space, as I mentioned, airport, railway station, any large volume building. And I've also seen my colleagues, scientists who pursue scientific research on this topic, who very rarely see these minuscule details. scientific research on this topic who very rarely see these minuscule details. And yeah, I would very urge them to think about this more holistically. What are the factors that really make or break a smoke control system? Because sometimes they are not the things that come to your mind first. So, that's it for today's episode. Myself ranting on smoke control of malls, presenting you my state of mind from many, many years ago, plugging in some PhD research. I've very rarely talked about this in public, actually. I've done most of this research before my career became sort of international. So you may never have heard about this research. So great place for you to hear about this for the first time. As I said, I wrote a memo to myself that maybe I should write a book about this. Maybe I actually should. It could be a nice guidebook. There are resources available. And to be honest with you, I now prefer talking, not writing. So here's my best try on how to deliver an efficient smoke control in malls. Let me know what you think. Let me know how you deal with smoke control in large volume buildings in your countries. Maybe there are things you care about that I have not mentioned in here. I would love to hear your perspective and learn from you. Maybe improve my own knowledge on how smoke control systems can be delivered. I hope some of this was useful. If you're a smoke control engineer, I guess it was. If you're not a smoke control engineer, I think we've touched many interesting points on what makes fire be a threat and what makes smoke behave in a certain way. Hopefully that is also useful to you. And yeah, that would be it. Thank you very much for spending this time with me. And I hope to see you back in the podcast next week. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
