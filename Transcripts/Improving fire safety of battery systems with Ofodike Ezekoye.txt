 Hello everybody, welcome to the Firesense Show, session 44. Legend after legend, I'm pretty blessed with the guests in line up in the podcast in the last weeks. And it's not other today enough to say that my today's guests, along with Professor Bobrowskas and Professor Horn, all together they've published almost 500 academic papers and I find that insane as an academic. Anyway, let's go with the big reveal quickly. My today's guest is Professor Oforike Ezekoia from University of Texas at Austin. And Oforike is an expert in battery fire safety. And I cannot imagine a better place working on the fire safety of lithium-ion batteries than University of Texas, Dawson, where the thing actually got kind of invented, where Professor John Goodenoff is lecturing and he actually got the Nobel Prize for inventing this type of battery. So great place to study battery fire safety and the great research ongoing in there i went into this interview with some tough questions about the safety of batteries thermal runaways and things like that but in fact it ended up as quite reassuring talk with a good friend about what's there to find out how complexity strikes at us again, and how smart people are battling for the safety of batteries. I think we've ended up with a quite well-rounded discussion covering many, many aspects of the battery fire safety. And I can tell you, I'm reassured. I'm reassured. I'm a little less scared now and more optimist towards new solutions that will come for the safety of this technology. And yeah, knowing that the batteries are as a hot topic for the podcast as the wood and fire, I'm absolutely certain I don't need to hype this anymore. more and that I already got your attention and trust me, if you enjoy listening, scientists who are absolutely passionate about what they're doing, they're happy and enthusiastic about the research and about sharing it with everyone else, this is an episode for you. So I really hope you enjoy. So let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello, everybody. I'm here today with Professor Dike Ezekoie. Hello, Dike. Great to have you in the show. Thank you. Welcome. Looking forward to it. I'm even more. Before the show, you told me that for the cold, chilly Texas winters, you're thinking about building up some PV installation and batteries. Aren't you scared of that? Absolutely not. I am an advocate of this type of technology of electrification generally and certainly in terms of battery systems. And so last year, February, we had a winter event here in Austin, which took out our electricity and took out quite a bit of infrastructure issues in terms of utilities. Even before then, I was very much planning on getting photovoltaic panels and also battery energy storage. And so that obviously just, in my mind, it solidified the need to do this. just in my mind, it solidified the need to do this and for all of us to, in some sense, have capability on hand for renewable energy generation and storage. So I'm very much looking forward to it. And as I said earlier, my reasons to do what I do are to improve the overall safety of these types of systems. So it's not an indictment of the systems. It's not saying that the systems themselves are sort of how intrinsically unsafe. It's just that we need to improve the overall safety of these systems so more of us can comfortably use them. That sounds like not a bad task you've set for yourself. I find the word safety quite difficult in this matter, you know, because whenever I look in the internet, people are terrified of the technology, like literally terrified to the level where we're banning in many European countries electrical vehicles in the car parks. mandatory to provide sufficient electrical power to power at least a plug-in hybrid on every parking spot in your car park and this law was put in place so the buildings are now built with these types of installations but now the fear has came here and now as we have these installations we are thinking maybe we should ban electric vehicles in the car parks so it's kind of crazy that we've went all the way to invest in this and now because of fear not facts not science not proof because of fear we are rethinking that well not me and the government and i would not uh i'm in no way connected to them but but I would despise this connection. Anyway, this safety, what makes this battery system feel unsafe to people? Why people are not scared of gasoline with heat of combustion of 46 megajoules per kilogram, which you contain like 50 liters in America, and it would be like 20 gallons in your car. Why we are not scared of riding on this bomb and we're scared of battery? What made us do that? Oh, you know, that's a great question. And isn't it the issue in general? It's risk perception versus actual risk. And we, in general, as humans, are horrible with really understanding risk, but risk perception is easy. And so with probably any new technology, and especially with the way that we get information these days, that it's very easy to trigger very irrational fears. And it's, in some sense, and maybe I'm guilty of it too, because of just the fact that we research it might make people think, oh my gosh, these systems are unsafe. Well, everything is unsafe, right? This is part of the issue. There's nothing that is absolutely safe. Well, that's entropy, man. Right, right, right. So the way, the only way that we can solve some of the really unsafe things, climate change, global warming, is to use renewable energy and to use energy storage. That is the way that we're going to deal with some of these incredibly unsafe situations that we should be afraid of and fearful of. And from that perspective, I think that there's a responsibility for technologists who are working in the safety area to be very clear about why the circumstances and issues in which we're looking at safety of particular systems. And again, it's not that these things are, it's not fear-mongering. It's not that these things are always unsafe and that we should, as a society, stay away from these types of technologies. But in fact, it's that how do we incentivize or move forward in terms of these technologies because we're improving the overall safety of these systems? that I do in the battery area as trying to create safer systems, trying to understand these systems better so that we can design against failure, because failures just happen. And we've seen the improvements in safety of internal combustion engines over the last 100 years. One could argue that when they were first introduced, I mean, a lot of the safety systems that we take for granted now certainly were not implemented there. So why wouldn't we expect that there would be improvements in safety for whether it's electric vehicles or electric storage systems within homes, within businesses, at utility sites? So the goal, of course, is to overall improve safety. And there's just so little data that currently exists. But I think that between the research and unfortunately, incidents that occur, we're going to improve the overall safety of the system. In fact, if you would look at it holistically at the societal level, I'm obviously not such a researcher. I think you're not either. But you've experienced blackouts last winter, right? And having this type of grid where everyone has a battery for themselves, that would be probably a life-changing experience at that moment. If you look at this, how big the benefit of this technology can be, it's amazing. And you've mentioned the energy generation and storage. Many of the new types of fuels we're using, wind, solar, they're periodic at best and random if you're nasty to them. Yeah. So you need a way to store that, and we need to solve that. And I also observed this movement that the buildings should be like net zero or possibly positive energy generation. It would be great if your building did create more energy than it consumes. That would be the best building. And buildings like that exist today. And so it's something we would like. And again, it's something we're afraid of. You cannot have both. You have to decide. And the more I learn about these systems, the less I am afraid of them. And I think that's probably the correct direction, I guess. Oh, no, I completely agree. And so part of it is how do we take industry, how do we take manufacturers from a position of being afraid of even acknowledging that there are safety concerns to a point of acknowledgement of those safety concerns and with a goal of improvement. And so it's a delicate balance that they have to walk because if on the one hand they talk about safety concerns in their systems, then it feeds into this perceived risk and perceived safety fears of the general public. Exactly. So from their perspective, and we've talked to lots of industrial concerns about, well, we'd like to help you understand the safety of your battery systems. And by battery systems, I mean from, again, the system level, whether it's a containerized battery system to whether it's a particular type of appliance. And the first response you typically get is our systems are safe and there are no problems with our system. And as a researcher who's looking at some of these safety issues, we know that's not true, that they can't possibly always be safe. There are considerations for, the one I always think about is, listen, fires have happened forever. Fire is always going to happen, whether we go to space, whether we're on the sea, fire follows us. And so fires will happen. And the issue is that energy storage systems will be somewhere where a fire occurs. It may not be the cause of the fire, but it will be somewhere where a fire occurs. Given that, what can we do to make sure that your system doesn't add to the consequences of that fire that we know is going to occur? And so that sometimes makes them feel a little bit better because it's an awareness that we're not saying that it's their system necessarily that's the cause of the problem, but that we as researchers in safety science and in particular on fire issues, we have an awareness about the frequency, intensity, consequences of fire generally, and we understand how other fuel packages can get involved and can exacerbate the fire consequences and fire impacts. So we're trying to help them in some sense alleviate some of these consequences, some of these negative consequences. So it's a delicate balance then of taking manufacturers and having them acknowledge issues and trying to improve the safety of their systems, making sure that the general public understands that these systems are generally safe and this is, in fact, the future, and providing guidance to regulators and authorities having jurisdiction who are decision makers about how to sort of balance this in their sense of how do we, you know, your example, how do we allow EVs in parking garages with the best available safety systems today? And what are going to be improvements in safety systems tomorrow? And how do we retrofit or move those forward? That sort of, it's a lot of work that we have to do for that, huh? Yeah, it seems like a roadmap to safety is needed, or maybe even not to safety. It's a roadmap to improve from position A to position B to position C, which doesn't mean that position A is unsafe. It's just position B can be safer, right? Maybe calling it a road to safety indicates that we are unsafe in some way at this point, which may not necessarily be true. For me, a very interesting way, as someone looking around at this field, which is very alien to me, I did a lot of things in compartment fires. I've burned buildings. I've did a lot of smoke. But, man, batteries are alien to me. They are alien. I don't understand them. I know they have power and they serve my laptop well, but I'm not an expert on that. So I wonder, we probably need solutions on all the levels, but the level of complexity of this thing is really huge. You have the level of chemistry, like your cathode anode, the fluid inside, the chemical compounds and reactions that happen inside the battery. You have the battery itself as a single cell, a single element, a single pouch that is an ecosystem on its own with its heat transfer, with its behavior, with its capacity, right? Then you start merging them together, creating an environment when you've connected multiple of them, not necessarily, well, you change the risk. The question is how much? Did you just add all the risk of them or have you created a system with exponentially higher risk than the cell individually? And then again, I've also learned that you don't just put a bunch of them into a car. You need a system that manages them. So you need to build a compartment for them or some case in which they're installed, which is a technology. You need a battery management system that makes sure they're operated at the correct parameters that manages the charging and discharging and so on. And then you have the whole system, which would be a car, a building, or the benefactor of the energy of this system. So you have this many level of complexities, and I see potential challenges and also potential opportunities for improving the safety at each of these levels. So please tell me at what level you act and where do you think the biggest improvements can come from, which is obviously the one you act. So I love what you just said for a lot of reasons, and it goes back to a little bit of what we were saying before, is that technology in general and technological systems are getting more complex. So that's something that's absolutely occurring. The pace at which these things are changing and evolving is increasing. The rate is increasing. So we're getting increasing complexity. We're getting increasing complexity faster. And we are on the safety side. We're, in some sense, the boundaries, the reins to try to make sure that we manage the overall safety of these incredibly complex systems. And so these battery systems are one of the first. the technologists, safety engineers, safety profession, to try to really figure out how do we allow this transition to occur in a way that makes sense. So I see myself as really trying to impact life safety and property protection issues associated with batteries. And the issue, though, becomes that I feel to do that appropriately and adequately, I need to understand this system because of the complexity that you mentioned. As an academic, I benefit from working with really smart people who can teach me about these systems. So my sort of goal is to learn about this and to communicate this and to improve the overall safety of these systems. I, we can't do these things alone. We, as we discussed, we work in communities, we tell stories, we talk. And so from that perspective, I've asked my students and my collaborators how to bring me up to speed in terms of our research by looking at things as sort of as far from what I do as, for example, electrical circuit modeling of cells. So I want to understand fundamentally, how does a battery work? And so I've had students working on pseudo 2D models of cells, of circuit models of cells, of all sorts of different models of cells, so that I can understand the electrical performance of cells and what issues cell researchers are interested in for them. That gives me some insight into what the challenges are at that scale and from a modeling perspective, because that's going to be important as we start to think about multiple cells or as we start to think about even layers of these sort of single-layer cell systems. Then at increasing complexity, then we ask questions about what happens if we have cell failure? How do we think about electrical performance as, for example, initiating thermal considerations? And so just even in the normal cycling of a cell, there's heat generation, and we appreciate that. We know that. Now, the question is, can this heat generation itself be managed, or is there some possibility of it cascading into a thermal and thermochemical reaction rate that would occur. And so understanding that is important. And, again, I'm not a chemist, but how do we think about parameterizing low-order models that can allow us to understand how this reaction process occurs, again, with an eye at consequence scale at largest, largest scales for us, which might be the building or container or the electric vehicle. And so now, again, it's understanding, for example, cell to cell propagation. Now it's a little bit looking more like what we normally do in terms of heat transfer, physics, mass transfer issues. Like solid fire. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So it's looking more like what we do, but it's a parameterization of the kinetics associated with that. I would argue that's not that different from what we as fire scientists, researchers have done for decades in terms of looking at condensed phase systems. My gosh, condensed phase, any condensed phase system is incredibly complex. I say, hey, talk about wood or polyurethane or anything, and you tell me that that's simple? There's nothing simple about understanding the degradation of these condensed phase systems. Now, with all the decades and number of researchers who've put so much energy and intellectual effort into that, we have a better understanding of how these systems degrade and what, both in terms of the toxicity, in terms of the energy release rates, in terms of all of these factors, what happens with these complex engineered systems, say, polyurethane. tools. You had Vito Bobroskis on earlier. We've devised tools to characterize and measure the energy release rate of these systems, again, the toxicity, chemicals, etc. We haven't developed that to the same extent for a new technology like a lithium ion cell. There are tools out there, but maybe we don't understand them, or maybe we haven't fashioned them into a way to really understand some of the issues in terms of propagation. And we're in the early days of characterizing and really understanding those types of details. But arguably, once we do understand that and we're able to parameterize these low-order models, then we can think about what propagation looks like, what rate of gas release looks like, what rate of energy release looks like for these types of components. And then we stitch it together at the higher level. Now, you said also that the complexity is not just associated with the cells, and that's absolutely true. The complexity is that it's a system, and it's a software-based system, which is increasingly true. So there's a battery management system. There are all sorts of other protection systems often on some chip or in some sort of logic sequence that's associated with that. And unfortunately, bugs can occur. You can buy a BMS for as cheap as $15, and you get what you pay for. So there are really strong battery management systems that, no matter how flawed a particular cell might be, they can overcome the flaws of cells. They can isolate it and probably... Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, exactly. They can balance out some of the issues between poorly performing cells and better performing cells because natural variability exists in terms of sort of the cells from a manufacturing perspective or otherwise. And then on top of it, we may have other components in the system, whether it's an inverter or other sort of traditional electrical mechanical systems. Any of these can possibly fail. On top of it, because of failures, we have sensors, and so these sensors could initiate some sort of activity. One would say that, oh, that would be crazy for a sensor system to initiate an intervention that might cause additional failures, But I think we've seen that even in the battery space where a misdiagnosis of, say, smoke, the smoke could have been outside of the battery container. So a smoke detector could trigger intervention, for example, a water spray that could damage the cells and then lead to a cascading propagation. And so without, again, naming names, things like this have occurred. So as we think about these very complex systems, maybe the issue really is that we have to rethink how we analyze safety for very complex systems, and maybe we're really learning with these battery systems. And this is the template by which our profession evolves in terms of understanding safety. I'm not even sort of ‚Äì I know nothing about fusion, but every week there's another article that there are improvements and pathways towards workable fusion reactors. Somebody's got to protect. So we already protect nuclear reactors as a community. So the nuclear industry uses fire and safety professionals to ensure that these incredibly complex systems don't catastrophically fail. We're going to have increasingly spaceports, and we're going to have rocket systems and all the complexity associated with the fuels there, and we're going to be the ones asked to manage them. We think about there was recently a large warehouse fire in the U.S. Warehouses aren't supposed to burn, right? We have all sorts of fire protection systems in place that should protect against them. But it's with the increasing complexity of all these systems that, you know, maybe we sort of the piecemeal approaches to protection and the research associated with thinking about protection for these complex systems, that it has to evolve also. And I know that you're doing a lot of work in terms of characterization of complex systems. Again, you said building scales. Buildings are increasingly complex systems with software, controls, HVAC systems, sensor systems. It's insane. It's incredible, isn't it? Yeah, I'm very safe about my war job. I wanted also going back to this issue of fear and safety. A failure is a failure. Not every failure is a catastrophe. So I wondered if maybe we could try and characterize what distinguishes a failure that could be acceptable or negligible from a failure that turns into first page of a newspaper. And we've seen these videos. There was a video in Shanghai with a huge fire. There was a video of Chinese buses catching fire. Shanghai with a huge fire. There was a video of Chinese buses catching fire. There was this ship that burned down with plenty of fancy cars for Americans, which you will not get. Shame on you. That's right. You're going to ride horses. Those aren't safe either. You can get kicked by a horse. And I would claim it's also a rich people's vehicle. But, yeah, what's the scenario when this fire of a battery system becomes catastrophic? What is the cause of such a fire? I know a phrase, thermal runaway, and it sounds scary, and I guess the videos have shown that. But how does a failure of a cell become a catastrophe? Good. Okay. So maybe first of all, we talk about possible failures of cells. And so a cell itself could fail because of challenges in manufacturing. What's interesting is that my university, University of Texas, has a long history of sort of excellence in battery materials. And so we have distinguished, we have a Nobel laureate, we have distinguished researchers who are working on the battery materials issues. There's a big step up between sort of designing and envisioning what the right battery materials are and the actual manufacturing of batteries. And so a couple of years ago, a few years ago, we decided that we were going to embark on an exercise to develop a battery fabrication of prototyping facility. And I was fortunate enough to be involved, and I'm still involved in that process. And so what I've learned about that is that battery manufacturing is, A, really hard. There is limited metrology and, in some sense, quality control there. The U.S. government has finally realized that battery manufacturing is a strategically important national interest. So it's something that absolutely needs to be done because we're increasingly reliant on these types of technologies. So learning about that has pointed out to me that very small mistakes can occur in terms of the manufacturing that would perhaps not immediately recognize in any kind of cell testing, but could have long-term consequences when a cell is supposed to last years, for example, so thousands of cycles. One thing, when we're talking about battery manufacturing, I don't know if everyone realizes it, but we're talking about unimaginable quantities manufactured at the same time. Like a line of battery produces like hundreds within a few seconds. It's quicker than a machine gun in terms of how they are produced. Here, it's not a quality control where you would take every cell and put it into a machine and then say, oh, this cell is okay. No, we're talking about it's a printing press. Literally, it looks like a printing press. It looks like a printing press. There's roll-to-roll technology. You're absolutely right. Everybody should watch, go to YouTube and take a look at a battery manufacturing facility in terms of how it's operating. So when you say challenges with manufacturing them, I can imagine even small issues at random, like every one million cells you get one that goes wrong, but that's like every five minutes, right? Yes. No, no, so you're hitting the exact point. So defects can happen when you're producing these types of large numbers, and even with really good quality control, some things will slip by that may have a problem. Okay. Now, a particular cell might have that type of defect in it. Otherwise, a cell could go into failure because of what we talked about before, the battery management system. So one of the things that the battery management system is trying to do is it's trying to balance, for example, between all the different cells in a battery. So, again, when we talk about a battery, a battery is comprised of cells, and these are individual cells, and these cells can be as small as a milliamp hour or so 100 milliamp hour cell or as large as 100 amp hour cell, which we've looked at and tested. From that perspective, there's a scale range in terms of the energy storage associated with a given cell. A large cell failing has very different consequences from a small cell failing. And now the battery management system is trying to balance between the different cells, whether it's in parallel or series configurations. And there is the possibility, for example, that because the cells are not identical, that you might over time, overcharge, over discharge any particular cell in the string of cells that comprise the battery. And that could lead to failures. And those failures could be, for example, something like an overcharge that might occur. And so in terms of the overcharge that might be occurring for lithium ion cells, you can get plating of the lithium metal because it's a transport issue. So transport limitations of the ability of intercalating the lithium ions into these active materials could cause something like a plating process to occur. As this lithium plating, this lithium metal occurring, for example, on the anode side, then you would get the possibility of dendrites forming. And these are, again, just whiskers, if you think about them like that, metal whiskers, that could penetrate across the separator, which is trying to keep the electrical charges away from each other, if you will, from having sort of spontaneous discharge. And then that could lead to a short circuit. So operationally, one could get a failure to occur. In terms of manufacturing, one could imagine that there's a failure that occurs. And certainly in terms of mechanical damage, whether it's a bending process, a crash of a vehicle that causes a mechanical failure, and that bending, for example, puts elements, the anode, closer to the cathode or tears the separator or punctures the separator. And then you can have a short that's formed because of this mechanical failure process. And then, of course, there's environmental failure. So we, again, talk about the fact that fires occur. We know that fires occur. So a high temperature environment could lead to the degradation of whether it's the separator within the particular cell or to reactions occurring within the cell itself. And those could lead to this sort of cascading failure of all these different reactions. And that's the process that we talk about in terms of thermal runaway. So a single-cell failure will occur. Single cells will fail from any number of reasons. And as you said, the issue becomes what does management of single-cell failure look like? And there are design professionals who are increasingly tasked to understand how to manage single cell failures, either through heat transfer mechanisms. So what kind of flows would we direct around a single cell or around the arrangement of cells so that if a single cell failure occurred, it doesn't cascade in terms of compartmentalization, as you mentioned. So are there, whether it's phase change materials or other types of materials that one could layer into these systems to manage the heat transfer? Now, the management of heat transfer is complex because, as we said before, just normal cycling of a cell causes the cell to heat up. So you think of it as a diode. Under certain conditions, under normal operating conditions, I'm going to get heat out of the cell and manage the overall system in terms of that heat transfer. Under abnormal operation conditions for a single cell, I may want to isolate that cell. So I will let that cell burn away, but I don't want it to cascade to the other cells. So people and organizations are designing, developing, I should say, design tools. And it's not just CFD. It could be resistance network. It could be other types of tools that would now be increasingly used to design the safety systems and protection systems. Oftentimes we think about it really as a thermal protection systems for batteries. Okay. So batteries, single cells can fail. There are design professionals, whether it's an electric vehicle company or an integrator developing for on-site protection at a utility or at a big box, retail outlet, et cetera, these protection systems. Now, having said that, hopefully those protection systems are still able to manage single or two or three cell failures. I would say that there's a push, there had been a push to going to larger cell capacities because of economies of scale and for all sorts of good reasons for electric vehicles. So people are saying, okay, well, let's go with 94 amp hour cells or larger capacity cells. Those are harder to manage both thermally and otherwise in terms of failure. So in some sense, we know there are vehicle companies, a lot of them came out of Silicon Valley that leverage what happened with laptops and portable electronics that have much smaller capacity cells. And so these are, whether it's 18650, 2170. So there are these smaller cell capacities and different formats that other companies have said, well, you know what, we can manage and control these better. Now there are challenges in terms of, you know, having so many small cells. So there's probably some happy medium that EV companies and others are going to think about in terms of dense enough and high enough energy density and large enough cells, but not too large that it becomes a control issue later on. Okay, so landscape-wise, there has to be this idea then that there is some sweet spot in terms of size of cells that can be controlled so that if and when a failure occurs, it can be managed so it doesn't cascade and propagate. Now, I'm interested in that, but again, I say, well, if they don't do their job perfectly, in quotes, we're still going to get larger scale propagation. And when we get larger scale propagation, we can get a whole module that fails. What are the impacts of that? Now it's kind of interesting. So probably you say the same thing. When I teach my fire science class, one of the first things we talk about is that the thing that sort of kills people most in fires is not the heat and fire. It's the smoke. So I think that in some sense we overthink the thermal issues associated with battery failures and underthink the toxicological impacts of it or the cascade of battery failures to other fuel packets and then to really the thing that we're afraid of or i'm afraid of which is the smoke so i think that connecting the dots between okay cell failure what gases are released what are the issues in terms of toxicity how would this impede people in terms of egress or otherwise what are the secondary fuel packets that could be involved in this failure how do we understand that cascade, what are the ignition issues and how do we think about what the life safety implications of that might be, I think that's where I want to be clear and really sort of hammer on and think about that's a strong one, man. That's a good one. You're right. That's probably the biggest challenge I had when I started playing with electric vehicle fires and trying to answer the doubts of people related about the car parks and electric fires. Because I, when I'm talking about traditional fires, if you can call them like that, you have this, let's say, rule of thumb, tenability criteria. Visibility of 10 meters is, let's say, acceptable. You know what amount of soot that is. You know the soot yield of your source. You can figure that out. You can find a plausible answer. But if I want to do electrical fire, like one thing that I noticed is they will have a completely different heat release rate curve and correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like not exponential, it's like logarithmic, it's like very sharp, it's not a huge heat release and suddenly it raises by a factor of 10 or 20. That's what I saw from the measurements and that's what you see in videos when there's like nothing, nothing, nothing and a huge flame. So we figured out, okay, we can in a way account for that by making a very quick heat release rate in our simulations. If we traditionally gave four minutes of fire growth to reach one and a half megawatts of a car to simulate a car fire in a car park traditionally, as making an error. Of course I'm far away from reality, but who in fire science is not? But yeah, but then that's a way to solve it. Yeah. But then again, emissions, like how do I account? What's my, what's my, I don't, I cannot even call it suit yield. What's my smoke yield? Like how much should I produce? And how bad is that? Am I still thinking 10 meters visibility? Or will I be very dead seeing for these 10 meters at this point? That's so frightening because I don't even have a good idea how to make it up. Like I did with the heat release rate, you know? idea how to make it up like I did with the heat release rate. You know, I love the work that's been the rise folks have done in terms of the battery space and vehicle fire space. So when the shipboard fire just occurred, one of the things I wanted to talk to about to my class about was, well, let's look at the heat release rate from an ICE versus a battery electric vehicle. And when we looked at the data sets and I said, okay, let's hear, I'm showing you the heat release rates. They were all between, say, five and seven megawatt peaks. And I said, okay, tell me which one you're more concerned about. And we looked at it and we looked at it and we looked at it and we thought, you know, they look a hell of a lot alike. You know, it's very difficult to discern sort of the one that I'd be more afraid of. And so when you think about all the fuel involved in a vehicle fire, there's a whole lot of stuff that's not necessarily battery. There's a lot of stuff to be afraid of that has nothing to do with the battery so now the question in my mind then becomes okay and i like to think about it this way we all know that smoke is bad smoke is bad when fires occur but are some smoke situation worse so are there things that are being produced toxicity wise that might be worse because there is a battery involved. And here's the thing. I don't know what the answer to that question is, but I'd like to know. And that's what I'd like to put effort into. And it impacts, obviously, occupants, but it really dramatically also impacts the fire service. Because when they're fighting these fires, The fire service, because when they're fighting these fires, they are intimately involved. You say, well, yes, but they're on SCBAs. They're on air. Yes, they are. But when you go less than 100 meters away, you see all sorts of firefighters congregating around equipment and otherwise without air packs on. What's happening to them? Are there issues in terms of the ‚Äì is there change? I'm not saying there is. Is there a change in the overall toxicity of the smoke because of the amount of batteries that have been involved in it? In the U.S., we just saw an ‚Äì we've seen a few incidents now, and we've seen it around the world, where there have been evacuation orders that have been placed when fires that included large amounts of lithium ion batteries were occurred. And are those required? Is it really just is it essentially a regular fire or is there something much worse or different about those plumes that we need to think about? So there's so many different aspects of this. need to think about. So there's so many different aspects of this. And again, we're not trying to say that, you know, batteries intrinsically and just are such a bad technology and we should not be going in this direction, but it's a clarification. So we understand better when they can be used, how they can be used and how to improve it. And just talk about just, you know, I'm rambling. I'm sorry. It's just as a point of a podcast. Yeah. We about, you know, I'm rambling. I'm sorry. That's the point of a podcast. Yeah, we're at a pub and I'm drinking my coffee and just giving an opportunity to ramble. But you think about something else that I think that there has been a lot of fear about, which is flame retardant chemistries. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So flame retardants have been, you know, in quotes, thrown under the bus as, and some of your guests on this podcast hate flame retardants. I'm not going to name any names, but they say that they don't really do anything. And for the harm that they potentially have, that it's not worth putting them in place. Now, if you look at an airplane, I don't think anybody in terms of safety systems for planes, in terms of the seats and et cetera, would say, oh, let's take out the flame retardants. Because we know that time is critical in those situations, and it's incredibly important. in those situations, and it's incredibly important. And then arguably, because of the complexity of flame retardant chemistries, they have gotten much, much better over the last 30, 40 years. It's enormous improvements in terms of their overall safety. So has research been important here in terms of identifying the potential issues and problems with it? Absolutely, I say. Has the industry responded by making safer flame retardants? Absolutely. So I think that the same issue has to happen in terms of while we look at batteries, that maybe the first few sort of ways that people put together battery protection systems, really inadequate, but something had to be done. And it's incumbent on researchers to understand what the limitations and issues associated with the safety of these systems are, point them out, and allow industry and other organizations to respond to require and improve the overall safety of these systems. So I think that there are analogies and there are ways that we're going to move along this path. Taking on what you said, that's the one thing that scares me, the longevity of this technology, that even if we figure out, if you go tomorrow and figure out your Nobel Prize award, the technology to make batteries fireproof or something, it's just going to be the new batteries, while we have already millions of electric vehicles on the roads with old batteries, you know. And from my perspective, people come to me and ask, should we design car parks for electric vehicles from now? And I tell them, when years ago, when you design a car park, you design it for electric vehicles, you just didn't know. And that's not the choice we make. So we have to deal with this in a smart way, not only with the newly produced. Maybe if you're a manufacturer, you probably are responsible for what you manufacture. But us as safety engineers delivering safety to the population, we're also responsible about what's around and how to manage that. And I really wonder if there are ways we can manage that, or do we just have to hope these things replace themselves? However, I also read somewhere lately that the rates of fires in electric vehicles were remarkably low, that there was some insurers' claim. I don't know how much truth is in that, but it was very ‚Äì if that is true, that would be very, very nice. Maybe you have some knowledge about the statistics of vehicular battery fires in general. Oh, gosh, I wish I did. You know, every paper we write about that, we point to other people's papers, and it all sort of leads to one paper essentially about what failure rates look like. But like you said, I think insurers are increasingly getting information. I mean just as the population and number of electric vehicles has come up, they seem to be much safer than internal combustion engine vehicles in terms of fires. I mean I think that's becoming quite clear that they are less prone to fires than internal combustion engine vehicles. And so now it's like, okay, we're on the right path and that's a good thing. There's something else that you said that was really, I thought was really interesting. It's just everybody and their grandmother is looking at what's the next battery technology. And so whenever I talk to protection type companies, I say, well, what about solid state batteries? Aren't those supposed to get rid of sort of the safety problems associated? And I said, listen, we're increasingly getting higher energy density and higher power density in all these battery systems. When failure occurs and the failure does not have to be associated with the cell itself because of all the reasons that you and I have just talked about, if there's a fire and your battery is involved with it, how does it contribute or impact the fire evolution? So that's question number one. Okay. Even with solid-state batteries, there are so many problems right now with solid-state batteries. I just read something recently about there's an electric vehicle company that said, we have solid state batteries in our vehicle. The range is no different. In fact, it's less range than liquid solvent-based electrolyte batteries. And it still has the sort of standard electrolyte materials in it because the solid state electrolyte, it's brittle, it cracks, there are all sorts of problems with it. So it's really a mixture of the sort of conventional electrolytes and the solid-state electrolyte, if you will. And so there's probably a decade before really this ‚Äì there's real implementation in this when I talk to the battery manufacturing people. And even then, as you said, the conventional batteries are a commodity and are relatively inexpensive, and those will dominate in a lot of markets and in a lot of applications. So in some sense, we're going to be challenged with managing safety systems for new and evolving battery systems, as well as the old systems where these large companies have dumped billions of dollars into manufacturing capability for these conventional systems. So we just have to keep working, I guess. But after this talk, I'm fascinated because now I see that even though the cell may be an old technology, giving it a new compartment, giving it a new battery management system, giving it maybe access to some new safety features like active systems that could react. It actually could improve the safety despite it being another technology from ancient times like 2013, right? That's right. That's right. Ancient, that's it. That is your spot on. Ancient times, indeed. Yeah. And one more thing. You've also mentioned this smoke as a problem, and I often run into this issue discussing the problem with people. They're like, man, these fires are huge. Their temperature is insane. Like, okay, that's a word. Nice. That's great. They will, like, destroy the concrete building. They burn so ferociously, and they can burn for two days. And I'm like, holy shit, that's like, that's a Nobel Prize, sir, because you broke conservation of energy and mass. And my experience with people who test batteries is like, if it burns quickly and fearfully, that's actually okay, because you're done with the problem. That's the best thing that can happen in the lab. Oh, gosh, you're so odd. It's funny, we just had a conversation with our local fire department. They were talking about electric vehicle fires. I said, hey, is this really true we need to apply, in quotes, copious amounts of water? I said, hey, you know what? I think, again, vehicle company X said this, and I really agree with it. If there's not an exposure that you're worrying about, let the damn thing burn and let it burn quickly. Let it burn quickly so that you don't have to babysit it forever so that you do get rid of all the stuff. Just make sure where the smoke is and you don't stay in it. Yeah, that's true. That's right. You got to, you got, it's exposures and those exposures, not just thermal exposures, it's thermal and emissions exposures, but it's really, it's managing exposures. But the way we might think about it is the safest battery is a burnt battery. So if we can burn it, then we're good. We no longer have a problem, you know? And which I'm not even going to speak to the fact that is one of the challenges is that when an electric vehicle or one of these appliances burn, there are a lot of cells in there that don't go off. It's your point, too. You said this, you said, okay, if five cells go off, isn't that safe? Well, it's safe for somebody, but it might be unsafe for somebody else who has to get those five cells out or manage the battery now that several cells have failed in it and others are compromised. So we don't know how compromised the other cells are and that becomes a longer-term issue. But there's going to be a whole industry that comes up to deal and manage those issues. Managing burned batteries is very difficult. I cannot tell you how we do it, but I can just say that having fire-resistance furnaces helps a lot in some things. I like it. I like it. I agree with you. I agree with you. When you do this battery test, the rule is you leave them there for a week, and after a week, they're more or less ‚Äì it would be very awkward if something happened a week after. On the exact day when you chose to pick it off, I would then consider it an act of God and I would just leave it. That's the point of view. But it's true that a burned battery is a safer battery than an unburned one. And when we discuss this with responders, they need to know there are two kinds of threats they will be exposed to. One being a huge fire to which they are used to where the challenge will be toxicological because the fire will be there as they know it. It's just going to be a little different chemical composition of the smoke in which they should not be anyway. Yes, exactly. So that's option A. And option B is if something weird is happening, it's puffing, it's showing smoke, smoke is gone. That's a completely different scenario. And then maybe I can imagine where you would have to isolate this vehicle or this battery even for days. Yeah. And let's the option C. And so whether it's confined or unconfined becomes the issue. And so we go to the surprise Arizona incident and other incidents. It's just that I conventionally have dealt with non-premixed flames. I deal with natural burning systems. But in another life, I did work on premixed flames. And so the challenge becomes that explosions can occur. I mean, so we're not just, we're not just, so when this thing becomes underventilated, if it's confined, it becomes underventilated. The products are not just CO that we might see in normal underventilated combustion systems. We have hydrogen and we have hydrocarbons in there. And so the explosion hazard is real. And so we have to start thinking about explosion protection in a serious way for confined or partially confined battery systems. I know. The last one we did blew up. Yes. Yes. Wow, man. It's an hour already. I told you like 10minute presentations are boring and long. I'm right, I'm right. This is great. It's like, it goes so quickly. This is great. Any famous last words? This was a lot of fun. No, no, but seriously, let's close it up with some statements. So I think I share your mindset. I'm not scared of this technology. It's a new technology, relatively new. We're on the front of making it safer, which does not mean it's unsafe. And there's a lot of smart people working on it and trying to make it better, right? I'm hopeful. I am. I'm very hopeful. I think that you summed it up perfectly. We're moving into ‚Äì there's nothing we can do to change this trajectory, I don't think, because it's incredibly required, and we're just trying to improve it. That's all. So I'm very hopeful that all of the effort that you and others and we're all trying to collectively do in this space will create safer systems. Yeah, man, thanks. This was excellent. I told you it was going to be excellent. I didn't believe that. I really enjoyed it. It was a great pleasure having you in the Fireside Show, and I'm sure I'm going to see you here again. And I hope to visit you in the Fire Science Show and I'm sure I'm going to see you here again. And I hope to visit you in Austin as well. That would be wonderful. That would be wonderful. There's supposedly some pickle challenge Guillermo proposed. What's the better way to eat a pickle? Like Polish way? Super sour or Texas way? Still fried. We're going to settle that in the battle. And it should be in Austin. We'll do it in Austin. We'll do it in Warsaw. We'll do it all over. Thank you so much. Thanks for doing this. See you around. Take care. Goodbye. And that's it. Hope you've liked this. I've spent one hour talking to DK and he's my best friend now. It was an amazing episode. So enthusiastic, so happy about the research he's doing and so optimistic towards the future. And I think that's what I really needed. An optimistic view towards the fire safe future of lithium ion battery technology. Because it is a part of our future, whether we like it or not. And it's great that smart people are working to make this technology as safe as possible. And as we mentioned in the episode, it does not mean it's not safe. It means we're still seeking solutions, how to tackle problems better, how to identify problems better, how to apply solutions at many layers of the protection within the battery. And with all of this, just make it better, more accessible, easier to replace, easier to fix, better from the fire risk perspective. So I hope you've enjoyed this optimistic view on batteries and you can share this with all of your friends who are a little scared of the technology and maybe they will get a little more enthusiastic about it. And with this optimistic accent, I would love to close this episode. Thank you so much for being here and listening. And I hope to see you next week. Another great interview coming your way next Wednesday. Cheers. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
