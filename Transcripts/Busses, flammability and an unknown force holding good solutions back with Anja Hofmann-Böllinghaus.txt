 Hello and welcome to session 29 of the Fire Science Show. So let's start with a tough question. Can you tell the difference between a bus and a train? I guess it's a horrible post question because it's a little obvious, but let's rephrase that quite a bit. Can you tell the difference between a fire that starts in the passenger chamber of a bus or a coach and a fire that starts in the passenger chamber of the train. I mean, they're like quite similar environments. In fact, they have seats upholstered. They have some sorts of carpets, linings, ceilings. They are filled with people, passengers who carry their luggages. So in the end, the ignition sources, the materials, the architecture of the compartment, they seem quite similar. Yet, if you had the fire start in the very same way, in a bus and in a train, they would end up completely differently. And that has a lot to do with the materials used in these two vehicles. And more precisely, the way how the fire properties of these materials are assessed and what is allowed to be used on both the types of the transport vehicles. And to discover what truly makes the difference between those two and what made one of them so much worse than the other, I have invited Dr. Anja Hoffmann-Buddinghaus from German BAM. And she's one of the leaders in testing the materials used in modern vehicles. She's going to tell me a lot more about how we test our vehicles, how we achieve safety or how we don't achieve safety in some of them, and what's truly missing to create a lot safer world in the world of transportation. It's very interesting because a lot of what we say can be extrapolated from buses and trains into passenger vehicles and maybe to even the whole building industry because a lot of these methods are very very universal i hope this will be very interesting to you it was very interesting to me and you really want to hear what anyia has to say. So maybe in our fields or your fields, we avoid the mistakes done by others. Anja Hoffman-Bullinghaus. Hello, Anja. Good to see you. Yeah. Hi. Nice to be here. Thank you for the invitation. Thank you for taking the invitation. I'm very happy to have you here. We've came here to discuss issues of fire safety in mass transport, because I've heard you did a lot of research on fire safety of buses and material properties used in them. And then I was like, well, that's quite a unique research topic. I don't know many bus fire scientists. I do a lot of research on passenger cars and car parks. So it's actually super interesting to me. Please tell me what pushed you on this pathway to focus on fire safety of mass transport and buses in particular? Yeah, it was mainly a very big fire in Germany in 2009, where the whole bus burned down and had many fatalities. We already, before this happened, know that the materials, the interior materials, were not as good as in other transport sectors. And so we were not that surprised that the whole bus burned down. Yeah, but it gave us the opportunity to have a project on this bus fire in particular. Was it a fire of the vehicle, like, alone, or was it, like, in a tunnel, or was it just a bus that burned down and people died in it? It was a bus on the motorway. On the motorway. And the problem was that the fire was not detected in the first part of the development, On the motorway? so the smoke came out of the bus underneath so the bus driver didn't see that there was smoke and the cars behind the bus tried to alert him that there is a problem and that there is smoke and then he stopped but it is assumed that one passenger opened the toilet door and gave the fire oxygen and then the whole, the whole passenger cabin was on fire very quickly. And then the toilet is close to the rear exit, and so the rear exit was not usable, and so the passengers could only use the front exit, and all the passengers who were behind this rear exit had no chance to leave the bus because it was so quick, the development of the fire in the passenger cabin. The people who survived, they could tell that they couldn't even rescue the ones which are really close to the exit because it was so hot and so much smoke that they couldn't even grab the people who were very close to the exit. That is such a horrible combination of unfortunate events because you have a concealed fire that's undetected. You have a space with the ideal ratio of ventilation to fuel to let the fire grow, but stay in this, let's say, incipient stage. So it's heating up, but not flaming to give warning, but again, not like going out. So it's just smoldering. So it must have been like quite a big fire in there. And then a quick opening or quick gulp of air, and you like almost have an internal backdraft inside the bus. Yeah, we did some FDS calculations at the time, and we could show that if you have a fire which develops in this area where it's not that much air, and then you give air to the fire, then you have a very quick filling of the whole passenger cabin with flames and smoke in a way shows that this scenario is likely that someone opened the toilet door and that is made the situation so so bad this scenario is nothing very uncommon in buildings like this is how backdrops happen this is how many firefighters train these situations. But we're talking about buildings. Not sitting comfortably in a bus on the motorway. So you probably had also, you would not like to jump from window to motorway. We had two fires. Actually, it's funny that you say that. We had two fires with younger people in, I think, the two or three years after this incident. And they survived because they smashed the windows in the upper deck and they jumped out of the window. But I don't think a normal passenger can do that because it is quite high and you have to be really fit to do that. So it was only luck that these passengers were so young and so able to do that. If you have elderly passengers or passengers who have reduced mobility, I don't think it's possible. And before we jump into the material properties, because that is an interesting topic, if this happened on a plane, for example, you would have the cargo smoke detectors, most likely, that would pick up the incipient stage of the fire and so on. Did this tragedy lead to some sort of introduction of detection in buses afterwards? Yes, a lot of companies introduced these smoke detectors very quickly, but it became mandatory then, after a few years, that you have smoke detection in areas where the driver can't see. So this fire probably would have been detected earlier if there had been a smoke detector at the time in the toilet or in the luggage area. So with new regulations, it may be less possible for such a deadly fire to occur because the fatal outcome of this fire seems to be a combination of many things. But one of them has not really changed that much, or I wonder here, how much it changed, and that's the material properties. And no matter if the fire is detected or not, no matter if the bus is on the road or parked in a lot, we know that these vehicles can burn. They are quite dangerous, especially when you have like a hundred of them parked next to each other. And we had these fires of like large bus depots. We had some in Poland, I know, I think in Stuttgart there was recently a large fire of this type. Yes, we had several, yes, this year in Germany, in bus depots where you see that, yeah, that they spread from one bus to another very quickly. And the consequences of such a fire are well beyond just the loss of a vehicle because it's a huge disturbance to the local community. If you lose 100 buses, the city can have quite big issues operating. Like we would just buy old buses from Germany, but you have to manufacture them, I guess. Yeah, I think if they can't operate, then for the insurers it is sometimes a bigger problem. When they can't operate the next few weeks or months, then there's the actual loss of the bus. But if you have bus defaults and you have 20 or even, I don't know, we had a fire in 2011 with nearly 70 buses in one incident. That's quite a disturbance. Yeah. So going to the material issue, I assume you started interest in materials after this big fire. And what was your first surprising finding regarding the materials? What did you expect when you've entered the study and what did you find out about them? Yeah, we were really surprised that the requirements for the automotive sector are really below all the other transport sectors. The requirements are going back to the 1960s and they consider mostly very little ignition sources like lighters or matches. They're supposed to be smoker equipment. It was based on the assumption that someone who smokes in the car doesn't set the car on fire. But over the years, I mean, a car or a bus from the 60s is not really comparable with something we have today. So the amount of plastic is really not comparable to these older buses. And it seems in recent years that it's even more plastic than before for comfort and for other things. And so the materials behave quite different from, say, train materials. So the materials behave quite different from, say, train materials. Because the requirements are so low, you have total different fire behavior of these materials. If you compare a bus seat and a train seat, they burn completely different. So it's not only the material itself, but if you have a component like a seat, it burns totally different. If you have a train trained seed and we made a lot of experiments with paper cushions and we ignited the paper cushions on top of the seed or a seed mock-up and the trained seed is made so that it's not burning. So the paper cushion is burning and then it's not burning further. it's not burning. There's a paper cushion that's burning, and then it's not burning further. And if you have a bus seat, then within two minutes, the whole seat is burning, and it doesn't stop. Yeah, I have in front of me your report on buses, and there's like an array of pictures showing the calorimetry tests of train seats, coach seats, city bus from 1995, and city bus from 2005. And I assume from the pictures itself, we can clearly see how different each of them behaves and how bigger the fire is when it's in the city bus. And it actually develops after the initial fire source is removed. develops after the initial fire source is removed. So this concept of resisting the ignition source is clearly failing here. I know my colleagues, we have similar issues with testing building materials. And, you know, they have some tests where you have, for example, put a cigarette against the material to test. And we're actually running out of cigarettes that meet the requirements of the standard it's quite quite difficult to obtain such a horrible cigarette as the test standard requires here i always had this i don't know doubt interest in understanding these tests because for me when you define the ignition source so well you can if i was a producer i could play around that you know i could make a material that resists this particular ignition source and just stop my development after that because i've passed the test and and i'm good and if you look at that from scientists perspective if you go into like science, even at the simple concept of activation energy or ignition temperature, it's not that it doesn't ignite. You just move the boundary of what is necessary to ignite that. So my next question is, did you go beyond the ignition properties and kept burning these items to learn more about them? Yes, we compared them to the tests from the train sector. So we put bus materials we obtained from suppliers or one from a real bus. We took some specimens and we tested them against the train regulations, the European train regulations. the train regulations, the European train regulations. And you can see a very big difference because none of the materials we tested from the different sources would be allowed in a train. So we found not one single material which passed the European test for trains. And I think trains and buses are not that different, even when you look how they operate. So the argument often is that the bus is easier to stop on the street and that it can stop everywhere. But on the other hand, you need some time. I mean, if you're on a motorway or if you're in a tunnel, you need some time to stop and you need some time to evacuate. So I think if you compare a city tram and a city bus, it's not so different. And it was like all flammability characteristics? Like it was both the heat release rates, smoke production, the yields of toxic materials, or just some particular ones that went out of range? It is more or less everything, unfortunately. It is not very positive. Yeah, I'm sorry. The main test in the automotive sector is a horizontal test, and I think I don't have to explain to you. I mean, if you have a match... Yeah, but you're very, very welcome to explain it to the listeners. If you have a match and you hold it in a horizontal way, it will not burn very much. And if you have it in a vertical direction, it will burn much more. So the horizontal test is not really discriminating a lot of materials, which means in the end that you can use a lot of materials you are not allowed in other sectors. I mean, even in the building sector, you have a vertical test as a minimum flammability test. And this is the same in the train sector and the ships and the aircraft. I think the horizontal test as a minimum requirement is not working very well because it's not discriminating enough materials. So at least it would be good to have a vertical test as a minimum requirement as it is in other sectors. In all the other transport sectors, you limit the heat release rate and the smoke production and the toxicity. And in the bus sector or in the automotive sector, you only have the flammability more or less. You have the vertical test and the horizontal test, and you have one which is smelting the specimen, but you don't have anything which measures the heat release rate or limits the heat release rate, and you have nothing which limits the smoke production or the toxicity. This is interesting. So you say that in this particular area, the whole fire safety of the vehicle actually was brought down to the concept of pretty much ignition. So that's the one and sole layer of protection that it's actively verified with these horizontal tests and melting to some point, I guess. But that's also a characteristic that I would put into the bracket of fire spread more than anything else, because before your ceiling starts melting on passengers, they're probably already dead from the smoke anyway. It's very ignition-oriented. Whereas from the tests that I know, where you would do heat release rates in any form, even simple heat of combustion, that's an indicator of, let's say, the amount of heat or the size of the fire that can be produced. If you do cone, you look at the very beautiful picture of the fire behavior of the material, including reaction to heat feedback, ignitability into the production of toxic products. When we go into buildings and how we would verify many of the features for the buildings, you would enter this single burning item test, SBI, where you would holistically look at the fire behavior of an element. And I can clearly imagine myself putting a bus chair inside SBI that's perfectly viable and could be used. And if you go up, there's room corner, maybe not as used as many years ago, but it's also a holistic view on the characteristics of your materials in compartment. So your view and your possibilities of understanding the fire behavior are like infinitely bigger than just flammability. Do you miss these features in these simple tests? Yes, several aspects. You have a very small ignition source like a Bunsen burner. So even the flammability test is not very strong. And in the recent regulations, you have more of the vertical tests but only for vertical mounted materials so something like the ceiling which is not vertical mounted would not have to pass a vertical test but it can promote the fire very well because you ignite the ceiling very fast, and then it spreads very good. And then on the other side, the heat release rate and the smoke production rate will tell you something of the ability to spread the fire. And if you don't limit the heat release rate and you have really, really high heat release rate, then it will tell you that the fire propagates through the passenger cabin very quickly. And if you don't limit the smoke production, you will have less visibility very, very quickly. And so if the passengers can't see the exit, they probably won't be able to reach it. So with the fire in 2009, they found passengers which were still stripped on their seats. So they didn't even lose the seatbelt because it was so fast. So that tells you something about the timeline in this development. And that is if you look at pictures from bus fires, very often you see the same picture, that there is no combustible material left. You only have the metal parts of the bus. And this goes really, really quick. So even if the fire service is relatively quick and it's at 10 minutes, then they don't have any chance to rescue somebody. that they don't have any chance to rescue somebody. So you have a situation where you accept that the fire service can't rescue anybody. And this is, for me, that is a strange situation. I took you here on a purpose because this particular issue is like a microcosm of the issues of fire safety we have in all sectors of fire safety. Test methods driving the development, not the fire safety, focusing on one particular characteristic of a material, also in the context of passing a test, without having a holistic view over the use of the material and the environment in which it will be used. Focusing on small scale events such as an ignition of a chair without considering how would this behave when it was a group of buses parked next to each other, where your heat release rate or the size of the fire next to your bus is so tremendous, it doesn't matter what your ignition temperature was of your material, it will ignite. And I guess in your very deep work on this subject, the government asked you to investigate this to prevent this. In your study, did you reach these conclusions, like this has to change, otherwise these large-scale events will continue? Otherwise, these large-scale events will continue? Yes. I think we had several recommendations. It was the smoke detection. It was the engine suppression because a lot of fires, at least in the classic buses, are starting in the engine area. And so a suppression system is very useful to at least slow down the fire until the fire service is on scene. One aspect we recommended, I think we are recommending this for 10 years now or something like that, to do something about the materials, and there is very slow change. I mean, there is this change that the vertical mounted materials now have to be tested vertically, but this is more or less the only thing which has changed with the materials. From my perspective, I'm very interested in the topic of fire sources and size of fires and plastics in relation to the size of the fire. It's also something that I'm really curious and maybe we can talk about that. It's also something that I'm really curious and maybe we can talk about that. The use of the plastics in our vehicles over the decades, how it's changed. And does this invalidate our assumptions for fire safety in many of the infrastructure projects? Because I'll give you my example. We do design car parks for passenger vehicles and because there is not very much research on the fires and passengers vehicles there is very few holistic projects on that we still would base our design from fire tests by tno in 1999 because they were very well documented they were done in a car park they were very well performed experiments They were done in a car park. They were very well performed experiments. Of course, there were further experiments in BRE. There were some in Japan recently. I'm not saying that there was no research, but I still find it very hard to replace my 20-year-old design fire because I feel confident regarding the setup, not necessarily the vehicle. And now, 1999, so they've burned vehicles not fresh from a factory. They must have bought few years old cars, like BRE bought 10 year old cars for their experiments. So I'm basing on beginning of the 90s, so vehicles from that period would now be considered classics. They increase in value now and they are completely different from what I have and what I see in my car. Like, it's a totally different planet. Completely different. Everything is plastic. Everything. So maybe you have a number for that, or maybe just rough assumption, but to what extent this increased, and how much it changes the holistic image of the vehicle fire? No, I can't quantify it, I'm sorry, but what I can say certainly is that the cars are totally different from the cars 10 or 20 years ago, and they burn quite different. So you see sometimes if you only look at the parts, they're a very big difference. And we did this seed experiment you mentioned before and unfortunately the newer seed burned much more than the older seed. So even in this bus you could see that after a few years the situation got worse. And that is not something you would expect. I mean, you would expect that the more modern seat burns not as much as the older one, but that's not the case. The old seat has wood parts, and the newer seat didn't have any wood parts anymore, and the foam was totally different. I can't say what it is because we don't know. It was from two actual buses, but it was thicker and it was more material. It looked and felt different. So there is a lot of change in this material and that leads to a totally different burning behavior. And it's more material, it's easier to ignite, and from your report, I also assume it's also more toxic, right? We found that the smoke production is very high, and that the toxicity is very high, or the toxic components are very present, and we tried to find out whether you can limit one parameter so that you don't have to look at everything. And the train regulations are quite complicated because you have to limit the smoke production, the heat release, and the toxicity. And so you have a whole set of experiments. And then we thought maybe it can be easier. But unfortunately, with all the materials we tested, we found that if you have a material which is okay in terms of heat release, then you can have very toxic gases or very high smoke production. So you need to look at all three parameters additionally to the flammability to have really a material which behaves better. So it is not enough to look at one of the three parameters, but you have to have a limit on all of them so that you really have materials which are better than the ones you are using now. I also have my eyes on graphs from the toxicity of your repos. I also have my eyes on graphs from the toxicity of your represent. One thing that's really stressful to me is that even if some materials perform well in them, there are other materials who will perform horribly bad. Like in one of your tests, HCL is produced not in such a bad amount for like a seed foam or insulation materials but then you you have floor coverings or ceilings we go crazy and on other graphs it's opposite and yet in the vehicle you have the perfect mix of all of them did you try or maybe you know any tests where it would be tested like holistically like a whole vehicle would burn and this would be measured or or it was not approached no but i think you need at first you need a scenario you want to address. I think with all the other transport sectors, they have a scenario in mind which they want to prevent. I mean, they have minimum escape times. We didn't even agree on that so far. How many times do you need to leave a bus in the case of fire? And so no test is really addressing this. And I think, yeah, we need to concentrate on what do we want to reach? Do we want to have, say, 10 minutes or 15 minutes for the passengers to leave the bus? Okay, you need to test which shows you in the end that this is possible. I mean, we tried to combine numerical simulations with our small-scale test to see what the benefit is of some materials. And I think you could do this if we had one calculation where we put in our model train seats and then we looked how the fire would develop if you have a train seat instead of a bus seat in your bus and then you see that with this paper cushion I mentioned earlier, then your development is so much slower that you have so much more time to escape. So that would really give a very big benefit and I think if you would have better requirements for seats, you probably would have really big benefit for And I think if you would have better requirements for seats, you probably would have really big benefit for the passengers. I also find it really interesting because for me it's very difficult to change my point of view into the safety of the vehicle and vehicle users because I'm so used to car parks and tunnels where I would care about the infrastructure and everyone else, basically. So it also shows how we're like in kind of separate bubbles. I enjoy talking to you and you most likely enjoy talking to other fire scientists. But there is no industry to industry discussion. I feel there is no discussion between the car industry at a whole with built environment industry as a whole. Yeah, sure. And you cannot separate the world of vehicles from the world of buildings, which are for vehicles to use. And I find lack of connection here. It's really, really bad for us all. Because there is so much we as the building industry, lack of connection here. It's really, really bad for us all. Yeah. Because there is so much we, as the building industry, could help with the other industry, like identify with all the test methods, with cones, with everything. Yeah. I mean, we've been there. We had combustible linings in buildings. People have died, and we fixed that. We had horrible flammability issues, and one way or another, they were controlled. We're battling with burning facades, and it's also a similar issue. So it would be great. And then we have to design our buildings for the dangers that this industry is preparing for us. And now on this topic, on the dangers that the industry is preparing for us. And now on this topic, on the dangers that the industry is preparing, so let's go into the world of electromobility. And I'll start this by a very bold statement of my own. I would claim that the change in the amount of plastics in a vehicle and their burning behavior is a far bigger risk factor than just using a battery or electric motor inside. I personally, if I see these two problems and I would have all the money and resources to solve one of them, I would go materials, not batteries. What would you pick? I agree to your point. I think if you compare the fire, the engine fire from the battery and the gasoline fire, I think it is comparable. I mean, you have some additional problems in both of them. I mean, if you have fuel and it can distribute itself on the floors and you have other problems with the battery where you have more toxic gases maybe. Engine fires. Yeah, something like that. But the materials are quite a big problem in both fires. And often they are not addressed. Often you are talking about the engine or the battery, and then you think, okay, that is really comparable and I agree. The whole part of the material is not addressed and you have a lot of problems in this area. And I agree that they should be solved. I think one problem you have with your batteries is if you are charging them, you're introducing another possible ignition source. And we saw this in some of these depot fires, that sometimes the battery causes the fire. And so if you have a car park or a depot and you are charging, then you're adding more possible ignition sources. You know, it's frustrating there is this debate on electric vehicles and everything in the vehicle side of fire safety is now so electric vehicle oriented and that's the next big thing. But you go over the fact that you have one ton of highly combustible plastic in your vehicle and this battery is not really changing that much. From the infrastructure point of view, the largest fires in car parks that happened recently, Stavanger Airport fire, the Liverpool Eco fire, we had a huge fire in Warsaw where a large car park has burned down. These were not so devastating because we had a vehicle with batteries in there. No. They were devastating because cars are very flammable. They contain hundreds of kilograms of plastics, and they're in a compartment that essentially is designed to be quite well-ventilated because you need to remove the fumes from the vehicle. So essentially you're putting a hell load of fuel into well-ventilated space and that's what you get. So I assume from our perspective, in our infrastructure, it's so highly underestimated, the flammability of cars. mobility of cars. And I guess from this talk and how you described the testing and the safety procedures in the world of large vehicles, I guess, is the same for you. If you look at this Liverpool car fire, you saw that the structure was really destroyed after this. Stavanger as well. So it was not made to survive. And if you look at the bus depots, at least the fires we had in Germany, the structure was destroyed as well. And with the buses, you have the additional problem that if you try to extinguish them from the outside, they are rain-safe, of course. They are made to be rain-safe. So you have really a problem if you have a bus depot which is really packed, and they normally do this because they don't have that much space, and they want you to make use of this space. So the buses are very close to each other. And then if you have one fully developed fire in one bus, normally it's very difficult to save the others because you already have so many hot gases and smoke you release with this one bus on fire. And if you have a ceiling, then you distribute the whole hot gas layer over all your buses. Okay, let's make a full circle. At the start you've said that you've observed it being quite different from the other transportation industries like trains and I assume aircraft as well and marine as well. Do you think that, for example, in terms of trains, the issue is solved and the same methods would work in buses and potentially in other industries? And if yes, how would you rank them? What would be the best to implement quickest to get the best return? I think from my perspective, the easiest would be to say we use the train materials we already have on the market in buses as well. That would be a very easy and very quick. Like plastic seats, cushions, linings, like these types of materials, yes? Yes. So if you would say you need the same requirements as in trains, I mean the trains and the buses have different levels they address. If you have a train which is only on, like a city train, you have less restrictions than if you have a train which is going long distance and using tunnels. And you could apply the same approach on buses as well. I do think that you don't have to be as strict with a city bus as with a bus which is doing long distance, where the people are sleeping and which is much more comfortable. So you have these differences in buses and trains. So it would be relatively easy to find something which satisfies the needs of different buses in the same way as it is done with trains. But it would, of course, make the materials more expensive. I'm surprised because I thought that you would say it to implement the same testing methods or transport some, let's say, approaches from the industry. But what you've said is actually so much, so much smarter. The good materials already exist. It's like it's not that we stand at the end of the road and we have to invent a new material or we fail. It's just they exist. It seems the issues with the ranking system and how we let some materials be used in a certain way and how some other materials are not promoted and when it comes down to economic incentive it's always the cheaper one will outpace the more expensive one it's quite sad that it's in the end it comes down to money, because it's society that pays for mass transport, and I guess it wouldn't be such a big deal to transfer that. No, I don't think so. I mean, if you compare, for example, from a different area, if you see mattresses in the UK and mattresses, say, in Germany, but I think in most European countries it's the same. We don't have in Germany any requirements for mattresses and in the UK the requirements are relatively high. And if you go to this big Swedish shop, the price is really comparable. It's not that the UK mattress is so much more expensive than if you buy this in Germany or in other European countries. So I guess if you would have a new regulation and it is mandatory for all the buses, then I don't think the price would increase as much as you now estimate if you only look at the difference between trains and buses. So in the end, it could be all about smart legislation and just promoting the good rules. I have a last question related to the best of your knowledge. These regulations related to flammability and the use of materials, are they also applied in passenger cars or there's a world that's completely different? No, that's completely different or no that's very harmonized the whole automotive sector that that is good it's very harmonized nearly worldwide very harmonized just with the wrong standards it's a pity that the requirements are not so high here so so this like issues with flammability, plastics, toxicity and everything, it's the same pathway as the large vehicles, and it's just a different scale, but the methods would be the same. Yeah, so you have more or less the same tests with the cars as well. I mean, normally you have less passengers, so your problem might be smaller, but even with the cars, you see that after a collision, you really have a big danger for the passenger to die in this accident. I think it is an issue with the cars as well, only on an asset scale, because you don't have this single severe incidence. You have more, a lot of smaller incidents, and so it's not so visible. But if you look at the news, you see very often that a car had an accident, a collision, and then a fire, and then it was impossible to save driver. I was quite aware of the issues with plastics and everything and how the vehicles changed, because there was recently a very good report by NFPA on the evolution of vehicle fires. And I know there's a follow-up to that one with full-scale electric vehicles experiments. And from my perspective, that's exactly what we need to build better infrastructure, this holistic testing. And from your side, it also seems optimistic that if you only could change the testing regime and standards and promote these better methods, which I hope you eventually will unleash on the industry. And if Germans do that, that's like half of the cars in the world already. So we will be much, much safer. Thank you very much for this interesting talk with some really sad conclusions that the solution may be simple. It just costs maybe not even too much. It's just because someone doesn't want to pay. so I don't know. I don't hope that there is another big fire which changes, but yeah, I still hope we can have some change without another major fire. Maybe episodes like this one will help promote the movement towards the better. That actually is the point of doing this. Yeah, very good, very good. I would really appreciate that. I hope so. Thank you so much, Anja, for your. I would really appreciate that. I hope so. Thank you so much, Anja, for your time talking about this important issue. And, yeah, all the best. If you change the industry, please let me know. I would love to make a very optimistic follow-up episode to this one. Yeah, I'm working in reaction to fire in the building sector as well. So maybe that's, I mean, I don't know, and with facades, but that is not a funny topic either. Thank you so much once again, and see you around. Yeah, thank you. So after this talk, I feel slightly depressed. We have identified quite a problematic field of engineering. We've identified quite a significant problem for the environment, for the people, with some ability of materials used in modern vehicles, buses. We have identified quite a problematic area where the flammability standards or reaction to fire standards may not be doing the best job filtering good solutions from bad solutions. filtering good solutions from bad solutions. And then, on the other hand, just next door, there's a very similar industry in which similar issues have been solved for years and years. And they're so, so similar to each other, but yet there is no transport of knowledge from one to another. I don't really get why cannot we have the same materials as we have in trains, in our buses. I mean, if it's identified that it is a problem, if it's identified that people literally die in fires because these materials are not good enough. And from the research Anya was quoting, and I'll link some of that in the show notes, it is obvious that materials are a significant part of the issue. So if it is so obvious, why cannot we just change the materials? There is this unknown force that is holding us back. And I'm depressed because I see this invisible force or glass ceilings everywhere in fire safety, everywhere where we have a bunch of legal testing frameworks that are so coupled with each other in ways that it's impossible to decouple them anymore, in ways that prevent us from really engineering the correct solutions because they would suddenly not meet the requirements of the law. Why are we forced to stand with these regulations instead of choosing a pathway that is known and is known to be efficient, working, and providing safety to the users? It's horrible. working and providing safety to the users. It's horrible. And I really appreciate that people like Anya exist who research that, who show this disturbance on paper with proofs. It's just sad that it is so hard to reach the people in charge with this message. And I would love to make a call to action to all of you so you can reach out to your authorities or something, but I understand it is unrealistic. So, yeah, maybe the best thing is just to share the knowledge we have, seek for the best solutions and promote them wherever we can and just use science-based evidence as the foundation of our engineering. And let's just try to create a fire-safe world, one project at a time. And when you have a chance to talk with authorities, if you see an issue like in here with the materials used in buses, take action, educate, and maybe this will help solving one of the issues of the world which for some reason are still unsolved even though the solutions exist. It's actually mind-blowing that the solutions are there, the materials are there, it's just not being used because regulations don't promote them. Anyway, it was very interesting to talk with Ania about that. I've learned a lot about direction to fire. I've learned a lot about how test method, the goal within the regulations can really change the holistic image of the whole sector or the whole field of fire engineering. And I'm very glad to have received this lesson from Ania. And yeah, in the next episode, there's more lessons to come. I have a very exciting thing to share with you that recently happened to me and one of my friends. And we're going to spend a whole episode discussing that and what interesting pathways that opens. So I hope you join us the next Wednesday. We'll be here. And thank you for listening to Fireside Show and see you next Wednesday. This was the Fireside Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
