 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, episode 100. Wow, that's a big number. I was thinking quite a lot about what to do with this episode. Had some plans, changed them. I had an interview with James Quintieri that was supposed to be this episode, but then I thought, it's not great to keep it in the refrigerator for two months, just to give it a nice number. So, that one's already out and I hope you've enjoyed that. I figured out in this podcast I've introduced some miniseries and one of these miniseries that's very popular is Fire Fundamentals. It could be because both of the episodes in this series were with Rory. That's a hypothesis. I have no way to disprove, but I also get a lot of feedback from you, from engineers, that you really enjoy talking about fire science in simple terms and helping understand the science behind the engineering that we do every day. So I figured out, let's do a fire science fundamentals episode based on something that's very close to my practical experience as a researcher and an engineer. That's smoke flow and smoke flow phenomena. And that's what we're going to talk about today. But of course, as it's episode 100, please give me some bragging rights. Let's cherish this moment for a second. So I'm super happy, delighted to reach this point in my journey as a far podcaster. This year has been so far quite nice. I had a chance to travel a bit and meet a lot of you in those travels in Berlin, in Portugal. I just came back from Leipzig. And everywhere I go, I meet fans of the podcast and it's really encouraging to talk with you, to cherish the podcast with you, to learn what you like, what you don't like about the show, to understand how this podcast can serve you better and how can I improve it. There's, of course, a lot of stuff that still I would like to improve in the show. It's probably an ongoing battle to make it as good as it is, but I hope it is at least as good as when I've started. And I hope I got some skill points in editing and interviewing. I really, really, really hope this improved a bit. It's very difficult for me to judge on my own. In the discussions, a common theme is for how long I foresaw the podcast to go on. And honestly speaking, after episodes around 20-ish, I knew that it's going to be a long time gig And at the time I knew it's going to go for a long while And today I still don't see any reason to finish that journey It's a very exciting and interesting journey And it is more exciting as we go So yeah, this is going to continue And I hope you still enjoy it a lot And you share your opinions. If you'd like to cherish this 100th episode with me, there's a good way to do it. For a long time, I didn't ask for reviews, and I didn't really get many of those. So if you could spend a minute and appreciate the podcast by leaving it a five-star rating or a review in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or you can do it on the FirescienceShow.com website.

Listen to the FastLine show. with OFR Consultants, which are a multi-world winning independent consultancy dedicated to addressing fire safety challenges. OFR is UK's leading fire risk consultancy, but they're not just consultancy, they also do a lot of research. One of that is that OFR is a part of the Structural Timber Association Special Interest Group, which was formed to address challenges in the sector through a series of work packages to provide both the guidance and evidence to support fire-safe design of mass timber, high-rise residential buildings, and commercial buildings. My laboratory is the proud partner of two of those work packages, and we are very happy to research mass timber together with OFR. And if this type of career is something that excites you, you may want to reach out to OFR in 2023. They are growing their team and are very keen to hear from industry professionals. Reach out at OFRConsultants.com. And now let's go to the smoke flows and entrainment. So I guess a good point to start is how I got involved in dealing with smoke and smoke flows overall. And when I joined ITB 13 years ago, I was recruited to a position of a smoke control engineer and a person responsible for CFD simulations of smoke flows, and that's a career that is ongoing for me. I very quickly learned to deal with smoke through the standardized means, you know, NFPAs, 92204s, BRE368 and other great tools that we have to engineer smoke control systems. And that was serving me quite well for many, many years. However, in like 2013-14, I started figuring out that there are things that could work a little better, that you can optimize the systems, that some magic numbers are not really working that well. I've started to dig more and that's how I became a scientist, researching smoke control and smoke flows overall. We did reviews on smoke plume models. We've published a lot of research on smoke visibility, wind and smoke, and everything smoke related related actually. Anything related to smoke is my business in science, I guess. So I'm very happy to finally be able to share some of my own thoughts on this with you. So somewhere early in my career, I was delivering a project of a shopping mall to one of the biggest architects around in here. And the guy was quite known for not being the nicest person around, and always, if you delivered a document to him, it was going back a full red, like if it was a reviewer or something in a scientific paper. Anyway, I had a passage of text about the smoke in that document, and he crossed the word flow, and he said that smoke does not flow, smoke proliferates. And actually he kind of got onto something in there. Smoke flow is a complex thing, it's not just a simple flow. For me, an example of something flowing is when you put a rubber duck into a river and it flows away with the river. That's a flow. But if rubber duck behaved like the smoke does, every time it moved, bumped or spinned around, it would split into more ducks and eventually you would have a whole lot of much smaller ducks in your river. That's more of how smoke behaves. So to understand the movement of smoke and all the complexities involved and all the consequences that this has to our everyday engineering and modern fire science, let's start with what the smoke is. That's maybe a naive question, but it's really interesting to dive deep into what goes into the smoke from the perspective of a smoke control engineer. So smoke mostly would be products of combustion, incomplete combustion, that would include gases like water vapor, CO2, CO, some toxic gases that you know from the episodes with David Purser, and also small particles of soot, which are basically a bunch of carbon rings stuck together that form large flakes that are suspended in the air. And this is something that we call soot. An important thing about soot is these particles are very tiny. One micron is already a giant soot particle. They are much smaller than that. And because of that, they weigh almost nothing. Perhaps it's even sufficient to describe them as weightless when we consider their movement around. This has some consequences, you know, because obviously if something's heavy, if you throw it up, it falls down, and everything eventually falls down. But in case of these really tiny particles, the time it takes for them to settle down is very long compared to the time scales in fires. So from the position of a fire, these particles just stay in the air. And what's even more important, as they stay in the air, they do not really change the physical properties of air, at least not in respect to the density, in a way that would be significant. They obviously change the optical properties of air very significantly, and we understand that through the concept of visibility of smoke, which we've talked a lot in this podcast in episode 3 three with Gabriel Lavinia and episode with Professor Lucas Arnold. Visibility of smoke is something very close to my heart, as much as smoke control. But, well, that's not the topic of today's episode. If you want to learn about visibility, we have resources on that. So smoke changes optical properties. The soot will also change the emissivity of air, which has significant consequences for compartment fire dynamics and the way how air can radiate more heat towards the surfaces in your room and spread the fire. But for just the flow, for just the movement of air, the smoke, the mixture of air and soot and the gases that formed in the fire is basically the same thing as the air that surrounds it. It's pretty much the same in the way how it behaves. Of course, it may have a different temperature, that's not it. But in the end, smoke is basically spoiled air. And this is very fundamental concept for us. Because if we can consider smoke simply air, then all the movement of smoke, all the flows, all the mixing is basically mixing of homogeneous mixture, air with air. This simplifies models tremendously because suddenly you don't have to go into complex multiphase physics. You don't have to go into very complex mixing laws, dispersion, fixed diffusion, or stuff like that. For simple smoke calculations, you just consider smoke as spoiled air, and that's enough. The air will obviously change its density related to the temperature that it's on based on the ideal gas assumption that we also put into place in here. And this, in the end, leaves us with a very simple mixture of gases, which are distinguished, basically, by temperature and their density. Now, why change of temperature is important? and their density. Now, why change of temperature is important? As the air heats up, it expands, it changes its density, and this creates something we call buoyant forces. It's forces that act on a lighter material, float in a denser material, that push it upwards, and this is the force that makes our mixture of air and soot and other particles that we call smoke. That's the force that forces it to go upwards, and this upward movement is full of very interesting phenomena that happen on the road that make this whole thing quite complicated and challenging for an engineer. This whole thing is quite complicated and challenging for an engineer. The air is obviously viscous, so if it moves or mixes with surrounding air that you could imagine is standing steel, if your smoke is moving through air, it will create some shear forces. It will mix with the surrounding air, so there will be some vortices. This movement is naturally turbulent. You almost never have in real life scenarios in large fires laminar flows. So, because we have turbulent flows, the air does not move in a linear fashion. It moves in large vortices, which circulate. They spin, and as they move, spinning through the space field with fresh air, they gather more and more air into the mixture. And this is why this whole mixture of smoke grows. This is why smoke proliferates. This is why we have more smoke as it moves, just as in the example of the rubber ducks. Now, an interesting and perhaps naive concept, if smoke is just spoiled air with some amount of soot and other particulates and toxic pollutants in it, maybe we can just dilute it to the level where it's not a problem anymore. And unfortunately, this is almost not possible in settings of building fires. It takes very low amounts of soot to significantly change the optical properties of the air. It literally takes 0.1 gram per cubic meter. That's how little you need to really obscure the visibility in your air. If you have one gram of soot per cubic meter of air, you will probably not see anything. So it really takes a little of this substance to create a challenging environment, which we would consider unsafe as engineers. And even if you try to dilute it, it would take such a tremendous amount of air to bring it down to levels at which it's not hazardous anymore. Okay, for toxic products you probably could do it faster, but for visibility in smoke it's simply non-achievable. So this is why I call the concept naive, because sometimes people think that you can just put a lot of air into the compartment where you have fire, and mix it all, and you'll have very nicely diluted smoke. Now, what you will end up with is just a lot of smoke everywhere that's not gonna go anywhere. Because as you mix, of course, if you add enough cold water to your hot water, your hot water will become cold again. The same thing when you're mixing air. If you mix hot air with cold air, it lowers the temperature and eventually becomes air at ambient temperature. If your smoke becomes air at ambient temperature, it loses the force of buoyancy, the magical force that pushes it upwards where we want it to be, where we have our smoke exhausts, where we have our smoke detection systems far above the heads of people that we want to protect against the smoke. So we actually like buoyancy. Buoyancy is working for us. It's doing the work to provide safety. Without it, we would not be able to deliver fire safety in buildings, at least not in most of those. So if your smoke, the mixture of soot, toxic particles and air loses the buoyancy, it suddenly is standing still everywhere in your building, mixing with the surrounding air, diluting a bit, but not to a level where it would be safe and eventually fills out the whole space. And that's the most striking view in some of hot smoke tests that we do in real buildings. That's the most striking view in some of the hot smoke tests that we do in real buildings. When you really do this exercise in a real building, when you set a real building in an artificial fire, and observe how the smoke moves and how quickly it can fill out the space, you start to respect this force of nature and understand how much engineering it takes to actually make buildings safe from this hazard. So, if dilution doesn't work, how do we make our buildings safe? Of course, I spoiled it already. We use smoke control systems. We use different types of smoke extraction, either through mechanical means, powered ventilators, either through natural openings in the roof, in the facades of our buildings. You can also, to some extent, utilize natural openings like doors and windows to achieve some goals of smoke control. Of course, we have more advanced features like pressurization and others, but this episode is on smoke, not smoke control. So let me stop here. What I want to convey to you is how engineers use the knowledge on the movement of smoke in designing their systems. So when you start your journey as an engineer dealing with smoke control, you very quickly learn the concepts of so-called smoke plumes, which is a concept that helps us mathematically derive the amount of smoke that is entrained in the compartment that we are trying to defend and allows us to calculate how much smoke we should extract to maintain a particular level of safety. Smoke plume is the movement of hot air and gases above the fire. So you have fire at some point of this fire, the flame ends, and this is where the smoke plume begins for me. And there's actually very serious definitions of where it ends and what's the intermittency of a flame, where it ends. But for simple engineering needs, it's all you need to understand that it's the hot air above the fire. And even if you have a fire that does not produce soot, like if you can imagine a fire of a methanol pan, it's quite interesting because you barely can see the flame. If it's very clean, you cannot see the flame at all. And there is no soot in the flame, but you still have entrainment. You still have hot air above these methanol pans, and you still have all the smoke plume phenomena that we normally discuss. So again, the presence of soot in those plumes, the presence of carbon particles that make it dark and obscure, is not something that drives the movement or impacts the movement that much. It's just an, let's say, aesthetic feature. It's the thermal flows, the buoyancy, and the natural rise and mixing of these hot gases with the surrounding air that create all the flow phenomena that we care about when designing smoke control. If I had to classify the plumes, because there's a variety of plumes, there's a variety of plume models that you can use in your engineering analysis and that you have to pick from when you design a building for a particular type of occupancy or a particular architecture, I would say there would be four major ones. One, the most commonly used, I guess, would be axisymmetric plumes and maybe axisymmetric plumes placed against walls, which we would call the adhered plumes. The second one would be line plumes. That's probably not that common in buildings, but still an important distinction. The third one would be all the flows from openings in your building, like door plumes, window plumes, and all the flows that happen through opening. The fourth one is something that many people are very passionate about. It's a concept that we call spill plumes, and that's when you have a complex geometry in your building and the smoke spills from one compartment underneath, let's say, a projecting balcony. And then it spills from that balcony into a common reservoir from where you want to extract it. Kind of like a reversed waterfall, smoke flowing upwards through all the obstacles it meets on its way. And spill blooms would be probably the most complicated we can solve with, let's say, fairly simple analytical models. Anything more complex than that, and of course, there are flows that would be much, much more complex than just a simple spill bloom. flows that would be much, much more complex than just a simple spill bloom. That's land of CFD, that's land of numerical modeling, where you really need more advanced tools to understand the physics of the smoke flow, and you cannot simplify it into a simple algebraic equation that correlates the flow with some variables. So first you have to think of what's the outcome of a plume model. What is the number that the model yields you that defines the flow of the smoke in the smoke plume? It doesn't give you images. It doesn't give you a video. It doesn't give you a fancy vectors colored with temperature. It gives you a number. The number usually is the mass flow rate, which is how much of kilograms of air mixed with soot, with toxic gases, is flowing through the region that we refer to as the smoke plume. This mass flow rate is already a useful number, but because for the smoke control design you probably need the number expressed in cubic meters per second or some other volumetric definition, you need to understand the temperature of the smoke. So that's the second variable that you want to receive from your smoke plume model. In terms of axis symmetric plumes, the world has been quite rich for us in the definition of those. There's plenty of different axis symmetric plume models. First, what does the axis-symmetric mean? It means we are talking about a very perfect symmetric plume. Imagine a pan of fuel that is around symmetrically perfect in every direction. That's the starting point for our plume model. And in many of those plume models, you have to define the initial shape of the fire. Of course, you don't put a shape in there. There's a variable that you put. It's either an assumption that it's a point source, so it's just a single point in the space. There can be an assumption that you include the perimeter of this source, which in a way describes the shape of the circle. Or there's an assumption that there is a virtual origin to the plume. If you imagine the plume as some sort of a cone with a sharp end at the end, and you take the end below your floor, you receive something like a virtual origin that is beneath, often beneath the floor of your compartment where the cone starts. So, at the floor of your compartment, it's not a point, it's a circle, and it keeps growing upwards. That's quite a useful description of a smoke plume for the mathematical calculations that we carry, and it's often considered like that. The variables that you put into plume models is usually some sort of heat release rate, the amount of heat generated by the fire, either the whole thing, the whole chemical energy generated by the fire, or the convective part of the heat release rate. Convective part means the part that goes into the buoyant plume, that is not radiated away from the flame. Because the flame will obviously radiate some energy from it. Roughly 30-35% of this energy will be radiated away. If you've ever been at a campfire, you know it's warm and cozy because the flame is radiating on you. So take this as a proof of this theory. So you define the heat release rate. And then the second variable, the second most important variable, is the height at which the entrainment takes place. So as I've said earlier in the episode, this flow is turbulent. It's a bunch of small vortices spinning all together and getting air into those vortices and growing and by this increasing the amount of smoke. And because they move upwards, the distance they travel upward will define how much of air they could spin inside them. So the height is a very important variable that defines, that dictates the amount of air you will have in your plume. Now, this is a very interesting concept because you cannot simply put the height of your building, for example, as the height of entrainment, because as the smoke reaches the ceiling, it starts to aggregate there, and you suddenly have something that we call professionally the smoke layer. So in your building, you'll not have smoke touching the ceiling and magically disappearing. That would be indeed a very good smoke control system. You have smoke that is aggregating underneath your ceiling with a growing smoke layer that descends down. So if you don't have any means of smoke extraction in your compartment, this will eventually reach the bottom of your compartment and you will be smoke-filled completely. If you have some mean of smoke extraction, and we could assume it's a quite efficient one, the smoke layer will descend, meaning that the entrainment height is lower and lower as it descends, because the smoke can rise into a lower height as the layer descends. Eventually, you will reach a height where the amount of smoke in the smoke plume produced at this interface height is the exact same as the extraction rate of your smoke control system, and you will have this equilibrium at which the amount of smoke generated and the smoke extracted is the same, and the smoke stops falling down anymore. You have a very efficient smoke control system at this point. It's a clever trick. I mean, it omits a lot of physics, to be honest. It's not completely true that the plume inside the smoke layer does not exist anymore there is still movement transfer of momentum shear forces and stuff like that the air still hits the ceiling there are effects along the walls where the flow smoke flows downwards and the geometry is usually more complex than just a cubical shape which you would fill out with a very perfect smoke layer. So, yeah, sure, there is more into that. But as, you know, a simple mathematical explanation of what's happening, a simple correlation that gives you an insight into how quickly these things go, and what you can expect, that's quite convenient and quite good. expect. That's quite convenient and quite good. Actually in our review of smoke plume models done with a team of fantastic Spanish people led by Gabriel Evinie, my good friend, we've shown that this transient calculation of smoke layer descent with simple plume models correlated into that were validated by a full-scale experiment in a very large atrium in Murcia, they were quite accurate in their predictions, so they did quite a good job, even though the physics was obviously simplified a lot in those models. So, smoke height, the height at which the air entrains, this is an important variable. Now, if you want to choose your plume model, you will very quickly realize there are different schools in how you do that. It's actually quite interesting where all these models came from. The basic physics, the conservation of momentum in a buoyancy-driven upwards flow, something we can trace back to Morton and Yig. This is pretty much fundamental science, and we know where it came from. It's just buoyant plumes and buoyant forces. This science even precedes fire safety engineering in a way. This was used by scientists focused very much on fire, like Philip Thomas, for example, who led the movement in the UK in 1960s. They had a series of large car factory fires, if I'm not wrong, that led to emergence of the need of smoke control systems that would be used to remove smoke. There is this very famous fire research technical paper, number 7, Fire Research Technical Paper No. 7 that outlines the concepts of natural smoke ventilation and a lot of concepts of buoyant smoke movement under very specific conditions. There was a gentleman named Hinckley who simplified these correlations a lot, and we've received a very simple plume model that we often refer to as the Thomas or Hinckley's plume model that is very widely used, at least in the UK and Europe. There are, of course, other models. Actually, there are four models, to be honest, that are leading or the most popular ones. The already mentioned Thomas model, the model of McCaffrey, the model of Zukowski, and the model of Eskestet. Each of them has its own peculiar features. For example, the model of McCaffrey distinguishes fire into different zones, where the flame is the intermittent zone and the smoke plume. Bernard McCaffrey, he's an uncle of Kevin McCratton, the creator of FDS. All the funny nuggets you can find in the Fire Science Show episodes. If I was not doing the podcast, I would never know that. And that's a very odd piece of trivia in my head that I realize I have now. Anyway, McCaffrey's model is a very popular one. It has been used extensively in CFAS zone model, the most popular zone model there is. It was superseded by Heskestad model at some point. The other model, Heskestad, it's also very interesting. It has the concept of the virtual origin. It was implemented in NFPA 92 and other popular sources of knowledge in this field, like EN 1211 Part 5, the European Standard, or Principles of Smoke Management, a very well-known handbook for this space. So, the Heskestrad model is very well used over the world. It requires you to calculate the height of the flame, and it requires you to calculate the virtual origin, but then the predictions of the smoke entrainer are quite good. And the other model I've mentioned, a model by Ed Zukoski, it's not used that much, to be honest, but I really like the way how this model was derived, because Ed Zukoski did experiment exactly how I described you the principle we use for smoke control design. So he had a hood under which he burned fires, and then he measured the amount of air extracted from this hood, which correlated to smoke layer being static at a certain height. That is exactly how we design smoke control systems in our buildings. So I find this model very intriguing and interesting in terms of how well you can predict the engineering situation. I thought that it should get more use because of that peculiar feature. The original model of Thomas is, of course, also very widely used. For me, the biggest issue with that model is that you provide the size of the fire through the concept of perimeter, which means you don't put the heat release rate anywhere in the model. And this is because the heat release rate is hidden very deeply in the constants of the model. And we've showed that with Gabriel, that if you play with the perimeter, you can either improve or reduce the accuracy of the model. So, it seems to be a little more complex than just these three variables that go into it that are commonly used. But yeah, these are the families of plume models. We have them. They are algebraic expressions of how much smoke is in the smoke plume at a certain height, and they certainly can be used for our engineering needs. This is the axisymmetric situation, when you have the most perfect situation, which, let's face it, is not very common in real-life fires. First of all, your fire may not be necessarily in the middle of your room. So, what happens when the fire begins closer to an obstacle, like a wall or a corner? Obviously, the entrainment, the amount of air that can be sucked into the smoke that flows upwards above the fire is not the same, because you don't have the whole space around the plume to mix the air with the smoke. You have a wall there that prevents entrainment at that end. And there are, we call this situation the adhered plume, and we have solutions for that as well. There were many people that were researching this space, For that as well, there were many people that were researching this space, and Professor Mielke in his handbook has given quite good explanations of how to calculate adhered looms. A rough estimation, and I took this from the book of Bart Mersi and Tarek Beji, which I highly recommend, The Fluid Mechanics Aspects of Fire and Smoke Dynam dynamics in enclosures a very a very good and useful book i i like it a lot and i refer to it a lot so in that book they say that for a wall plume you would end up with roughly 60 percent of axisymmetric plume flow for a corner you would end up with 43 percent but that's mass flow. You have to remember that the fire will grow quicker, the flows will be at higher velocities. It's not that simple. But still, we recognize that there's a difference in how the smoke will behave if you have it in a confined space. And we have models that help us predict what will happen. Now, the second type of plumes, they have mentioned line plumes. The story is very similar to the axis-symmetric plumes, but now instead of a point source, you have a line that is a source of your smoke, and the upwards movement is very similar to the one you would have in axis-symmetric plumes. I've mentioned the book of Bartman, Sint, Tarek, BG. There I've mentioned the book of Bartman, Sint, Tarek Beji. There is a very good explanation of line plumes in there and some models that can be used. So perhaps it's not the most exciting thing to talk about today. The third thing, flow through openings and windows, doors, stuff like that. This is an interesting one and this is not an easy one. Because if you imagine a fire in a compartment situation, obviously, you will have the smoke layer forming above the floor at some height, and eventually it reaches an opening, and then smoke will flow out of your compartment, and the fresh air will enter the compartment through the same opening at the bottom of it. Now, how much air exits the compartment exactly? That's quite interesting question. And people try to answer that for the history of fire science. We have some good solutions for that. It's easiest if you have flashover drum that is a ventilation controlled fire. We perhaps have the best solutions for that case. When you design smoke control, you probably will be working with not fully flash-over fires, because we're talking about early-time evacuation and stuff like that. You probably don't want to have your fire fully fletched at that point, because it's difficult to control. So in practical engineering, you will end up with smaller fires. And then you can solve this flow by solving the Bernoulli's question on doors, finding the neutral pressure plane, integrating the amount of smoke flowing in the upper part of your opening and the bottom part of your opening. But so far you've sold only the opening and the smoke will flow somewhere from that opening. It's quite interesting. That was a big part of my PhD when I was investigating those type of smoke flow phenomena. We don't have good exact solutions for that. We only have rules of thumb like Howard Morgan once wrote that you should double the amount of smoke that you get from an axisymmetric plume with a star and a caveat that it requires further research. Unfortunately, the further research never came, and many people would still use the double value of the normal plume as your door-opening plume. For me, it was an important part of my PhD because this thing, the amount of smoke that flows through your opening is the initial value that you put into further calculations of spill blooms that we will talk later in the episode. But that's your initial value. And it correlates to the size of your door. So the smaller the door, the smaller the flow. So if you're an engineer, you want this number as small as you can. Well, it's an easy way to do that. Make the door as small as you can. But what you do is you capture the smoke inside the room. Now, the very funny thing, funny consequence of that assumption is that if you make the door very, very large, you will end up with absolutely insane amount of smoke from the algebraic equation, because it does not understand the energy balance in your compartment. It does not understand the fact that the fire is a finite source of buoyancy, is a finite source of heat. It cannot fuel a 100 or 500 meter long opening in your doorway. So actually, when you extract all the smoke that's produced in your room, you converge at a certain value, which is perhaps the maximum possible for a certain compartment. This is what I've shown in my PhD. And interestingly, you can make a very, very large opening, which does not produce as much smoke as you would expect from the simple door equations, because of how big the fire is inside the compartment. But it leads to a very efficient smoke control inside the shopping unit, which means you can design a much safer solution for your shopping mall. You can actually save lives with that. That was the part of my PhD. Unfortunately, not much is published in English. It was the part of my life where I was focused on the Polish market. I have a book in Polish on that. I'll link it in the show notes. I have one paper in English. I'll link it if you're interested in that. Take a look. I'm cringing right now. I'm not sure if I want to share my PhD with you, but I have a love-hate relation with my PhD. Maybe someone will find it useful. I'm happy with this research. So I believe someone will find it useful. I'll link it anyway. So you have these plumes in your openings that go further into your room and further into your building. And now if your building is complicated, that's what's happening with this smoke. This is where we enter the regime of spill plumes. Probably my favorite thing in fire. The thing that made me became a fire scientist. When the smoke flows outside of your opening, it will reach obstacles on its route. It will flow underneath projecting balconies. It will eventually reach the edge of the balcony where it will spill over into some larger space in which the smoke will gather. The complexity of the space can be various. It can be just a simple atrium, but it can be a shopping mall with many multiple shopping units on the way. Or it can be a hotel lobby with balconies connected to the rooms, maybe perhaps escape routes at this place. So places that you want to keep away from the smoke, especially in malls. For some reason, I always find the top level of malls as the food court areas where people would eat and would spend a lot of time. And that's the exact place which will fill with the smoke the fastest. And the exact place where I do not want my smoke, which makes my job challenging and perhaps rewarding as well. my job challenging and perhaps rewarding as well. So, using this type of calculations, again, simple models that require input in terms of the mass flow at the spill edge of the balcony, for example, the rise above the balcony at which the smoke can entrain air, the width of the plume at the edge of the balcony, the inputs that you need to put in there. And the outcome is the exact same as in axis symmetric plumes. You get your mass flow rate, you get your temperature of the smoke that allows you to work with that. Again, you can employ the concept of smoke layer forming in your smoke reservoir, lowering down, making the entrainment height lower, meaning that less smoke is entrained up the way. It's quite complicated calculations, but we really have good resources for that. NFPA 92, BRE 368, and perhaps the best resource in this space would be the PhD thesis of Roger Harrison, who did enormous amount of research on spill plumes in both free setting, where, like in an axisymmetric scenario, the plume can entrain air from around its circumference undisturbed by anything, but also in plumes that were adhered to a wall, which have specific different behavior. Excellent work by Harrison, and I always said that this work, it was supervised by Mike Spearpoint. This work was perhaps the sole reason I became a scientist. I then realized that what I do can be called science, and it's actually quite fun and possibly useful to people. So, smoke models, a whole world of possibilities, a whole world of engineering tools that allow us to quantify how much of the smoke is produced. And by smoke, again, it's a spoiled air. Smoke, again, is a spoiled air. It's a mixture of the combustion products with air that is at a different temperature than the ambient air that is forming above the fire and flows upwards, meeting obstacles on its way, flowing around. If we're at obstacles, there's one more very interesting smoke flow model that is very useful in fire engineering calculations. And these are so-called ceiling jet models. So when your smoke reaches the top of your compartment, it does not disappear there. I said that it forms a layer, but it's not that it magically forms a layer. said that it forms a layer, but it's not that it magically forms a layer. There's a certain physical things happening to this smoke, to this air, when the layer is generated. So, as the flow is upwards, it meets an obstacle, the ceiling. It must change the direction, so it starts flying perpendicular to the previous direction, and it starts to flow along your ceiling. Pretty much like if you spill a bucket of water on your floor, it's going to flow in all directions. The same happens to the smoke. And this flow along the ceiling is something that we refer to as the ceiling jet. Now, the ceiling jet has its properties. refer to as the ceiling jet. Now, the ceiling jet has its properties. There are famous correlations derived by Ron Alpert that define the ceiling jet, that allow you to calculate using Gaussian functions for characterizing horizontal velocities and temperatures. They allow you to get just that velocity and temperature in the jet. You can also find mathematical correlations that will allow you to calculate the depth of this flow, so you know how big part of the space it's taking. Why is ceiling jet important? In the early part of fire, we want to detect fire. If you have sprinklers in your building, you would like your sprinklers to operate. They must be triggered by the fire. It's naive to believe that the fire will happen directly underneath your sensor or your sprinkler. They have their operational ranges of a few meters. We space them out, assuming that the smoke will eventually reach them. And it does. It obviously does reach them exactly in this ceiling jet phenomenon that I just introduced you to. In a ceiling jet, the smoke flows horizontally along your ceiling, eventually triggering your devices. And if we understand what are the physical properties of the smoke in a particular point of time correlated to the size of the fire that is happening at that time, you can understand the velocity, the temperature of that smoke. You can probably calculate the amount of soot that is carried away with the smoke as well. And this gives us tools to predict the response of the devices in the compartments. This is exactly how we calculate the response time of our sprinklers, for example. This is how we calculate the time to triggering heat sensors. This is the exact fundamental basis of DETECT models that were widely used in fire engineering for decades. in fire engineering for decades. There still are cell phone applications employing DETECT that are used by engineers to predict how soon a certain fire of a certain size in a certain space will trigger a sprinkler. The calculation is very easy. We have a sprinkler model, thanks to the efforts at FM Global. We call it the RTI model. It defines the response characteristic of a sprinkler model, thanks to the efforts at FM Global. We call it the RTI model. It defines the response characteristic of a sprinkler, including very simplified heat transfer inside the bulb. It basically allows you to calculate how quickly a bulb of a sprinkler will heat up when exposed to the flow of a certain velocity and temperature. And velocity and temperature is exactly what we get from the ceiling jet model. So if you couple both, you can predict how fast sprinklers will respond. And that's actually a beautiful capability we've gained in the 1970s, if I'm not wrong. Perhaps it was one of the first fire safety engineering applications we had. Ceiling jet models are definitely very useful. They found new uses with the emergence of things like traveling fire models, where Hassemi's model has been used to calculate the flame extensions underneath ceilings and some flow phenomena that help defining the heat flux in front of the fire. You can learn more about traveling fires from episode I had with Guillermo Reynon on that. I'm super happy to randomly throw episodes into the chat that we had that go in-depth into the stories that I'm saying. This is exactly why I've started the podcast, to have a library of good resources people can go for. But yeah, enough of this. Let's go back to the smoke flows. And we're approaching the end because, well, the story of smoke flows is obviously much bigger. We can go deeper into engineering calculations and how smoke control is designed, but perhaps that's a different episode with a different expert maybe. So finally, last thing I wanted to tell you about smoke control is something that I am working a lot these days, and that is fires in tunnels. That is the concepts that we use and employ to control smoke flow in tunnels. Tunnel is a very simple building. It's a pipe, essentially. Tunnel engineers absolutely hate when the tunnels are called pipes, but It's a pipe, essentially. Tunnel engineers absolutely hate when the tunnels are called pipes. But it's a very good simplification. It has two ends, usually. And you can blow air through it. That's the simplest form of smoke control you can introduce in a tunnel. Now, if you have a source of smoke inside your tunnel, a fire that's happening inside, all the phenomena that we've talked about today will happen. It will create a buoyant plume above it. It will create massive ceiling jets that will go in different directions. If there's inclination of your tunnel, there will be a chimney effect that's powered by buoyancy, the exact same thing that powers the entrainment of a smoke above a fire, all these forces combined will create a natural flow of smoke in your tunnel. Now, we want the smoke to go in a very particular direction. We want to blow through it. We want to have control over it so that people can escape and firefighters can enter and save the day by extinguishing the fire. So we introduce smoke control, very often longitudinal smoke control, that simply blows through the tunnel. And now, if you want to design that thing, there are some very interesting concepts of smoke control related to the smoke flow phenomena that you can have. Particularly, you can have two effects or two outcomes of the smoke flow, if I may. One is something we call critical velocity. This means you blow so much air into the fire so quickly that you completely overwhelm it and the fire flaps to the side where you're blowing and no smoke absolutely goes into direction opposite to the airflow. This is critical velocity. This is velocity at which you have absolute control over the smoke. It sounds like a great thing, but perhaps it's not necessarily the best thing you can have in your tunnel in many situations, because if you blow air on fire, you will make it grow. Also, because you're blowing air with such a huge velocity, all the mixing phenomena that I've described happen. So you mix huge amounts of smoke with the incoming air, and in the end, with the incoming air, and in the end you have so much more smoke, and it fills your whole height of the tunnel. So it comes at a cost. But there's a different strategy that you can take. Blowing air at a much smaller speed, which we sometimes call the confinement velocity, that what it allows you to do is to push the smoke away. that what it allows you to do is to push the smoke away. You don't prevent the smoke moving upwards of your airstream, a concept that we often refer to as back layering in the tunnel. So the smoke moves back against the airstream from the direction you're blowing in. For some meters, you have to define how far that goes, how far that stretches, how much back layering you allow for. That's engineering process. But essentially, if it happens for like 20, 30 meters, it's not a problem at all because this smoke will be returned into the direction you're blowing anyway. It's just going to be a small layer of smoke flowing backwards. And this you achieve at a much, much smaller velocity, woods. And this you achieve at a much, much smaller velocity, perhaps at a velocity low enough to transfer momentum into your smoke. So you force the movement of it, but low enough to not mix it to the point where it would lose buoyancy. I hope you're following me. So the smoke has buoyancy. It flows up into the layer. And what you're doing here is you're pushing the layer in its entirety. The whole layer is being moved and the smoke is not mixing with the ambient air, it's not falling down, and you're removing the smoke in the form of layer. That's perfect because you want the smoke to be above people, vehicles, and everything that you have in the bottom part of your tunnel. So it is perhaps the most efficient way to extract smoke from a tunnel. This is something that my student is doing their PhD on and we are researching a lot because it's very interesting when exactly and at what air velocity these effects occur and how you can practically achieve that. And of course, to do that, you really need to understand smoke entrainment and smoke flows very well. I think I will stop at this. There is so much more to cover in terms of smoke flow, but I think we have already covered a lot. I really hope this was entertaining to you. I hope it was perhaps useful to you. Please let me know.

I need this feedback to make my job better or maybe to shut up and not produce those anymore. If you want Rory back in the Fire Fundamentals, be my guest. Spam him with emails. I will very gladly have him back in the show. If you help me organize that, I will appreciate that. Rest in peace to Rory's inbox at this moment. I hope we can convince him to come back to the show for more Fire Fundamentals. And I am very eager to produce more of these episodes for you. If you have ideas on what topics we could cover in Fire Fundamentals, please let me know. And I will try to produce them for you. let me know and I will try to produce them for you.
