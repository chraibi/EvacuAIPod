 Hello and welcome to episode 56 of the Fire Science Show. Great to have you here. First, let me thank you for all the feedback and ratings and reviews that keep popping now and then in Spotify or Apple Podcasts. As mentioned in previous episodes, it means a lot to the show because it gives us a chance to be shown on rankings and other stuff that people use to seek for podcasts to listen and be discovered by people who may actually benefit from it. So I'm very thankful because it's a great way to reach new audience and by leaving reviews and ratings, you help me a lot building my community, which you're a part of. And also, as usual, nothing works better than word of mouth. So if you can recommend a podcast to a friend or a colleague in your office, that's even better. On the today's episode, I guess my today's episode is kind of an avatar of who I would like to reach with this podcast because he is a firefighter, a fire engineer, and someone who actually has quite a decent fire science background going through professional criticism in Maryland. His name is David Stacey and his company, Performance Based Fire Protection Engineering, is a nice growing business based in the US where through fire science and fire modeling, he delivers holistic performance based fire engineering projects, which we're going to talk about in the episode. But we're going to talk about a lot of things, a lot. We start with how being a firefighter changes your perspective as a fire engineer and how being a fire engineer changes your perspective as a firefighter we go into the ways how people seek knowledge and how different sources come into play at different stages we've mentioned mentioned how you need to communicate with other stakeholders, especially AHJs, in the performance-based design processes and how Dave's company manages that. And in the end, we go into the world of fire modeling because Dave is also a fire modeler. So we go all into CPUs and cloud modeling, BIM import, and other things that are really interesting for modelers. So, boy, we've touched a lot of subjects in this episode, and I hope you will like it. For me, it was a great talk with a fellow engineer, and I hope you will enjoy it as well. So, let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzy≈Ñski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to Firesize Show. I'm today with David Stacey, UMD alumni, full-blood fire safety engineer, a firefighter, and the man who runs his performance-based engineering business. Hey, David. Great to have you on the show. Hey, well, good, yeah. Thanks for having me. Excited to be here. I'm happy to talk with a fellow fire engineer because the point of the podcast is to bring stuff that's useful to our community and I need a reality check what the community needs and you are you are my reality check super happy to have this discussion so first of all maybe tell us a little bit how you've ended up in your own company as you you were a firefighter right and suddenly a twist in the career. Yeah, it was definitely one of the more unique stories. I think most of us that fall into this profession actually have an interesting story how we got here. So yeah, I've always been involved with the fire service, you know, even back to middle school, early high school days, really involved with the fire service. And that's what I wanted to do. But I was doing good in school, wanted to pursue higher education going to university so when i was finishing up high school i literally typed into google firefighting college trying to find something that was hands-on operational side you know on the firefighting side and maryland came up and maryland's program obviously the department of fire protection engineering as well as the fire station there uh college park volunteer fire department so i quickly realized that was a pretty cool opportunity where uh have the fire, fresh inside operations, as well as a world-class university and degree opportunity. So I got into Maryland, got my BS in fire protection engineering. And yeah, even then, when I was graduating, I still really enjoyed the fire service and wanted to go that route. Had some good internships withIST, whereas where I got my fire modeling startup when I was interning there, Steve Kerber brought me in there and Dan Madrikovsky was there at the time. So that was an amazing opportunity. For sure got me on my feet and also interned with the then RJA, now Jensen Hughes in their Arizona office. So I had some good opportunities. So I knew those opportunities were there, but pursued the fire service, got hired as a career firefighter out of college with an engineering degree. And once I got through the academy, I was out in the fields. I looked back for employment opportunities with an engineering firm. And again, at the time, it was still RJA, well, Jensen Associates, in the Raleigh office, Raleigh, North Carolina. And they took me on pretty much as a part-time, full-time position, you know, over 30 hours a week. That's a little part-time. I had two full-time jobs. I still have two full-time jobs, but I enjoyed doing both. And yeah, I got in a wide range of work types, but really found a niche doing fire modeling, specifically smoke control performance based design. I was there for about seven years, got my P.E. and just realized at that point I had three children and it was a good opportunity to split off and start my firm. And that's how I got to where we are today. And yeah, I found it performance-based fire protection engineering which in the name our go-to work type and our niche is is fire modeling performance-based but we are a full service fire protection firm you must have amazing ceo on your website with with that with that name yeah but that's a great story and um you've been very lucky to touch so many aspects of fire engineering, like pursuing top U.S., one of the best of the world's fire science for years exposure to real fires. So that is very rare somehow, very rare combination in our field. And I don't really know that many fire experts who would have experience from both. I'm not going to lie. I knew that before. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted you on the show, going to lie. I knew that before and that's one of the reasons why I wanted you on the show because this perspective is truly unique in the world where we design systems made for safety and in many cases made for firefighters and from my experience with my firefighters around, I sometimes design stuff they don't really like or use or need or want and somehow gets in the code and I have to design it. They don't know why. I don't know why. The person who wrote the code probably is dead for like 20 years because it was 50 years ago and we're in this conundrum designing stuff for no good reason. So going into serious discussion, my first question is, can you see an immediate effect or immediate benefit of you being a firefighter and working with PBD systems, with performance-based design systems? It definitely is a benefit. I think it's in my day-to-day life, I may take it for granted. More often than not, my co-workers and partners in my company are reminding me like, hey, Dave, you know, your experience, you could really leverage that. And it goes a long way. The biggest impact, taking a step back and looking at it and seeing how it impacts and we're able to utilize it to our advantage, is how we communicate with 37 jurisdiction, with the ASJs throughout the U.S. They are used to, I feel like, and this isn't a knock on other professionals in the field, but there's ways engineers talk, right, within design teams. And then there's ways that you can communicate more effectively with ASJs, with fire marshals, fire inspectors, and building code officials. So I think what I've learned is I'm able to kind of flip a switch when I could be in one hour on a design team call talking to architects, mechanical engineers, structural engineers, and then 30 minutes later be talking to an AHJ, and I'm able to flip that switch and kind of communicate with them in a little bit different way than they're used to. For example, outside of a PBD project, let's say a simple Springer design project where we're trying to have a conversation on where we should put the fire department connection. I've caught myself a lot of times saying things like, oh, you know, your first two engine companies, it's not going to pull in over here. They're going to take the main address. They're going to hit the hydrant across the street, so it makes sense for the FTC to be here. And you kind of see, especially if we're doing a video call with the ASJs, they're like, how's this guy know how to talk about that? You know very specific fire department operations, it gains some buy-in, not that you have to sell yourself, but it gains some buy-in where they're like, okay, this guy understands what we're trying to do as a fire department. I love that because it echoes my last episode where I said the number one skill is communication. And I love how you also put that on the very first place. And I think any fire safety engineer dealing with problems, on one hand, having architects, other stakeholders who are not fire experts. On the other hand, having a client who is paying and is absolutely not a fire expert. They're just interested in not spending too much money. And on the third hand, having the jurisdiction, the fireman, the code officials and so on. And then with each of them, you have to communicate successfully. And with each of them, you require a different way of communication. And do you think for those fire safety engineers who are not involved in fire operations, because, well, honestly speaking, like not very much people would be actively involved, like you said, and not many people would have time and will and maybe are just not fit. It's also not smart to jump into fire if you're not trained. But do you think there is a way how engineers or fire researchers would get at least a touch of that to build up that mindset to open up their view on these issues? Sure. Yeah, I think there's several steps that can be performed. The timing of it is one thing. I've been involved in the fire service for almost 20 years. I was a very young child, but I was going around the firehouse, hanging out, starting to learn stuff. So I've been involved for a long time. I've picked up a lot of experience and history in doing so. But if you're completely green to the fire service, meaning you've never been in a fire station or ridden a fire truck, no volunteer fire department experience, which is fine. I think a great first step is to reach out to your local jurisdiction. Firefighters are one of the most welcoming professions. If you stop by a firehouse with good intentions, they will gladly open their doors and bring you in. So I think as small, as informal as stopping by a station, telling the crew there, hey, this is what I do as my profession. I'd love to sit down with you one time and talk about some challenges I've had with working with building officials, fire officials, with designing systems, determining if there's a disconnect. You know, hey, do you guys like standby connections on the intermediate floor level or on the floor level? It's a great, I mean, they will talk for hours about stuff like that. Firefighters are very into the job. They're always trying to improve their working environment and their operations. So they would welcome you into the station. I agree. I love talking with firefighters. I get exposed to them a little bit more. One reason, because of the number of professional projects we carry. The second reason is that our testing facility, testing laboratory, is literally next door to the regional training center for firefighters. So they often come to our lab as protection for more dangerous experiments. And then we often have to carry, we cannot carry open air experiments in our lab, but they welcome us in their lab where they have a permit because they're firefighters. They can do a little more than us. Right, they have some more leniency. So that's like this relation being built. But outside of building like personal relation with the local firemen, to my head comes UL as a great source of resources and courses. Yeah, I was just going to bring that up, Ojek, is to give a plug for UL and Steve Gerber and his group over there. What they're doing is for sure the catalyst of connecting fire engineering, fire safety engineering, fire protection engineering to the fire service, actually putting science and data to fire ground operations. They've gotten away. And again, this is always very important in university, but from smaller analytical tests type projects, which are great. Right. Understanding planes in different conditions, planes in outer space like that's highly sought after and needed research. But what UL is doing is putting the practicality of actual fire around operations. How does a firefighter opening a door and not opening the bedroom window as a ventilation point versus opening the roof as a ventilation point? How does air entrainment get affected by post-train application? Guys are going crazy over this research, this data, and the way they deliver it is tremendous. And I think other organizations are taking UL's lead. NIST has revamped their database on heat release rate and design fire characteristics. Oh, yeah, that is brilliant. It's really looking sharp, and it's helping get others engaged and have buy-in on that research. And before we switch the topic, do you think it's worth it? Absolutely. I think it's been a little bit of a challenge, specifically several years ago. Firefighters and the fire service, they don't like things to stay the same, but they also don't like change. So when data was starting to come out, right, there's a lot of hesitation. And, oh, that's just lab stuff. That's just science stuff. This is how you do it in the field. It took a little bit to break that threshold break that ice but now i mean i'll see it routinely in the station guys pulling up reading these reports watching the videos because we like watching videos versus reading um and it's starting to get it and you'll i mean we've changed some tactics with my career department based on this research and it's starting to be captured holistically across that field. Based on resources, but do you also see in your job as a firefighter the impact of you doing PBD and understanding buildings more? Again, like compared to your colleagues who would not be PBD engineers or fire safety engineers. Is that impacting your everyday life as a fireman? I think there are certain conditions, more so on the training side and educational with my crew. I serve as a captain on my career department. And within the department as a whole, we actually have a couple of FPEs on my department, which is pretty cool that are in operations, not prevention. So we're kind of looked at towards some technical guidance from high-rise smokeproof enclosures, tear press systems, atrium smoke control. And then PVD, when we look at, we have a lot of vertical growth, a lot of growth going on in our city, decreased fire separation, distances between buildings. And, yeah, you can point out, even some products that I worked on personally, some of these performance-based designs popping up in the jurisdiction. So it's a good opportunity to educate and teach guys about how that design, how that building was built, the effort that went into making that condition equal or improved to the prescriptive code. I ask a lot about it because, you know, at some point I've realized there's a missing link between these two groups of people, which in essence to succeed, they each need each other, you know. We need firefighters because our strategy is so heavily relied on firefighter intervention at some point. Only if you don't care about the interior of the building or like you're 100% sure your compartmentation is going to work. Otherwise, you rely on firefighters intervention. And we often take design decisions based on this hidden assumption in the back that it will happen and at the same time firefighters need us fire safety engineers because in many cases the fires in the buildings today grow so fast that without active systems without good passive system strategy it would be just impossible to fight fires in a complex building. So these two professions need, they need a connection. And there are connections being built, as you've mentioned. There's many being built. And in this podcast, I would love to build one more. And that's why I'm so interested in these aspects of how life of a firefighter and performance-based design engineer for fire safety systems, how that twists together. Now, if you may take me to your journey into performance-based design, you made that the name for your company, but I would really love to hear what it is for you. How would you define what you're doing? Sure. Yeah. So globally, and a lot of listeners of your podcast are familiar with performance-based design. Here in the States, obviously, it's a design option. It's an international billing code. It's in adopted codes and standards. But what I will say is, again, in the U.S., it's definitely lagged behind other geographical areas of the world. So although it's been there for quite some time, it's always been an option. Some jurisdictions are more hesitant to the approach. And, you know, again, from my initial experience in my early portion of my career, I identified that was a good opportunity. The tools and resources from what I've seen and from what I've been a part of are being developed to further enhance the approaches and the acceptance of performance-based design. And yeah, I mean, from a business model, right, I see it being more and more prevalent in the U.S. So I saw it as a good opportunity to say design teams, architects, right, they're ever so often increasing their design goals, their crazy ideas that we need to solve, right? They want to have the next best thing in building design, tallest building, the biggest building, have the next best thing in building design, tallest building, the biggest building, large open spaces, non-separated spaces from atriums and arenas. And these things are coming down the pipe. And the prescriptive code makes it clear, you know, right in the introduction to these codes, that it's not meant to hinder alternative ways of thinking as long as it meets or exceeds the code. So that's how I jumped into PVD and it's quite accepted in the U.S. However, we do run into certain jurisdictions that are more reluctant. You know, when we come in there and say, hey, we're trying to justify an excess travel distance, 250 feet to 300. And here's why and here's our approaches. Some jurisdictions are, I don't want to say playing it safe, but they really want to rely on the prescriptive code in this current time. But we're getting there. Nice. I always found performance-based design, like, for me, that is the engineering. The other part is code speak or a cooking book style of engineering. So that's the thing. That's why I pursued this career. That's what I wanted to do with my life, not apply your codes and standards, which awfully a lot of my time is exactly that. And I know you're dealing mostly with smoke control projects. Is there like the main aspect where you employ PBD and you've mentioned travel distances as well? Any other aspects of your work? Sure. yeah. So with performance-based design, as you said, smoke control is definitely one of our most prevalent work types in terms of fire modeling, PS, pathfinder, and CONTAM for high-rise smoke group enclosures. And technically, those design approaches are not an alternative means and method. It's not a performance-based design approach. They're directly allowable in the code. So within performance-based design, I would say our heavy hitters are excess travel distance, fire separation distance, alternatives facing for methods of smoke detection, such as beam pockets, providing detection to every other beam pocket, maybe some advanced method of smoke detection, some air aspiration as an alternative. Those are some of the common TBDs. advanced method of smoke detection, some air aspiration as an alternative to show improvement. Those are some of the common TBDs. And then we get into some, what we have to be careful with performance-based design is your decision on one aspect of fire protection or life safety can affect others. So certain projects are more single lane, right, solving one issue. But a lot of times we get into that holistic approach, which I know you're familiar with because that's how the whole building is built. And that's the one part I think we lag behind here in the States is we have to make sure that what we're changing on one aspect of a project doesn't have an adverse effect on others. So I really enjoy the full holistic methods of performance-based design where we're looking at sprinkler protection, smoke detection, fire separation, braiding requirements, smoke controls thrown in there, fire department access. Maybe fire department access is hindered and we need to provide an alternative solution to provide an equal or greater level of safety. The way we discuss it with our clients is basically any code challenge. Now, we're not always going to have a solution, but when they are stumped, when they say, hmm, we never run into this, how can we solve this problem? That's when you reach out to a firm like mine. And we're not going to have a solution every time. It may be something that we're like, no, I'm sorry, we cannot get away from Sprinkler protecting this high hazard occupancy just by doing a model, right? But we do try to work with them, try to come up with a pathway moving forward for a solution. As you said, fire modeling, excess travels, smoke movement in general, fire separation, and these all are things that you can verify through fire modeling. You mentioned CFD, FDS software. I guess that's a big chunk of what you do, modeling fires in buildings. chunk of what you do modeling fires in buildings I wondered as a professional what type of resources would you normally seek for this? So yeah in terms of design fires it's one of the topics I'm really interested in and I try to be involved with you know you have several committees through the SFPE doing design fire database research I was involved in a research project through the SFPP, as well as a couple of pool fire protection and the University of Maryland, where we looked at a historical look at what information is available to us. Are there any gaps in information and where do we need to go moving forward? So I think as a professional, there's a little bit of a lag in more modern research coming out that becomes available to the engineers. There's a lot of private experimental data being developed, a little bit of a lag coming out to the field. When you look at handbooks, SFED handbook and other resources, the UMD has a design fire database on their website, NIST, of course. A lot of these are, relatively speaking, dated, right? You have old televisions, old wardrobes the classic christmas tree fire that everyone likes to reference right but at a certain point when we're going 5 10 15 years down the road when do we have to think about okay what am i using as my basis of design my design fires what are my fire characteristics my soot yield is that appropriate for this building so the resources are there but i think surely there's going to be a framework to continually develop that and make it accessible across all engineers. With your involvement with SFP as well, the Standards Committee for Performance-Based Design, right, that's one of the goals to kind of globally try to align us all. And through discussions even on that, it's like, well, do we say you do a five megawatt fire in any atrium that's four stories? And the answer is no, because we do need to have some allowance for that engineer to make that decision or what should the suit you would be in that case. I think in the end, we always have to have that area of interpretation and justification for the engineer. With that being said, hopefully we continually update our database and our resources available to us. And what about like for me as a researcher, as a scientist, my first steps would be towards places like Fire Safety Journal, Fire Technology, like scientific publications. And give me an honest answer. Do you think these things are accessible enough for engineers? You didn't mention them, so I guess it would not be your first step to seek them. And I truly wonder how engineers would use this type of resources. And if they don't use it, you have any idea why? Yeah, great question. I find myself within those journals, the fire safety journal and some of the more technical resources, when I'm looking for something very specific. So perhaps design fire characteristics or heat release rate from a certain energy battery or a certain vehicle type within it or a certain occupancy. That's usually when I get driven to those. And I'll be honest, sometimes I'm doing Google searches, just trying to gather all my resources. You know what you have to be careful of, right, is you just don't see one number. You're like, okay, that's what I use. But part of my process, again, for a very specific approach or analysis is find as many resources as I can and references. I save them in my project file. I read them all. I highlight appropriate sections. I try to correlate it all together to come up with a conservative basis of design for that analysis. As far as readily accessible, I mean, some of them are subscription-based. You already have to purchase articles, which is fine. Some are thesis that are defendant, which are great to reference and utilize. I think it's everything out there that you need as an engineer. It is attainable. It's just the level that you go to find it. Again, for instance, I feel like you have to be careful where you just don't find one resource and you say, okay, yep, 550 kilowatts is what I'm using for my design fire. You really have to look into the weeds, make sure it's a well-vetted experimental set, and then go from there. And on your everyday reading list, I would assume you would be closer to reading reading fire engineering from SFP and then just browsing through FSJ, I mean, fire safety journal on a daily basis. I'll be completely transparent. I'm not a daily reader of FSJ. I don't think it's like as a negative trade because it's absolutely not. And I am an academic and I would not consider myself a daily reader. It's just this assumption that we as a fire scientist community, we try to deal solutions, make research that eventually is an utility for the community. But I also see there's, again, a missing link between the worlds. I love how you have framed this searchability or ability to figure out, does a source exist? And if it does, where it is? And if it is, how can you access it? So there's like these glass walls that need to be broken. You have to be very intentional to actually get to a scientific paper and get your data out of it. Exactly. 100%. That's exactly my point. And going back to that last group, I was a part of the Design Fire database project sponsored by the SFE Foundation. That was pretty much the result is, right, the grand goal would be, yeah, a one-stop shop, a database, everything and anything from government research to private research to just engineers that say, hey, I justify this based on ABC, putting it into one searchable database. It sounds great. We would all love that, right? Yeah. The effort of both collaborating, contributing, vetting the information, making a graphical interface that's searchable is achievable for sure, but it's going to be a good amount of effort. But that was pretty much the result of our research and gap analysis in that project is it would help the community. It's going to be a lot of work. There's a lot of steps to be taken. And we're kind of looking for direction if it's going to move forward to pursue that or not. What you're saying now is actually amazing because, unfortunately, the things you just mentioned are very incompatible with with journal papers however the knowledge would be transferred in in that way and that's something i need to talk with my colleagues in in higher places the editors and other who pull the strings in journals because if we want to make science more accessible it's not about building more walls and more sophisticated knowledge pouring into the journals but maybe finding ways how to actually get this knowledge to people and that is something i would love to see okay enough rambling about journals and thank you for your openness and honesty to talk about that. You've mentioned before that in your communication with authorities, you have to convince them for a solution. Now, you've also told me before that you have some steps or process or your approach how to communicate with them. So maybe you can share if it's not like trademarked and patented. It would be a great patent, a way to convince authorities I'm right. So first, yes, it's not so much to convince them that, hey, you know, you got to sign off on our solution. It's going to work. It's fine. Just, you know, sign this document. More so, if you want to use the word convince, on the overall approach to welcome the analysis and the possible pending acceptance of it. So, no, our process is not proprietary. What I would say, it's definitely following the projected path of, as I mentioned, the SFP Standard Making Committee on Performance-Based Design, where we have different chapters on what's required from your obviously identifying your scope and your project goals, your performance metrics, having a design brief, having your final report. All these steps are being developed back of house right now. And just to be clear, the goal of that standard making committee is to make an annex material to the building code structure so that the ahjs have a resource they say okay i'm being asked to entertain a performance-based design i have no clue what that is oh here's appendix material to the building code it helps me understand and accept this approach so that is going to be huge especially in the states because again we're we're behind on that front so in terms terms of right now, what do I do? Because that isn't necessarily in place yet. Our approach is very methodical and direct with them. So even if there's certain jurisdictions that we work with quite a bit, they're familiar with us as a firm, with fire modeling and TBD holistically. So they understand it. But regardless, we always, first, what we do is called a letter of intent. It may not be a physical letter, but it's at least a discussion with them that says, hey, we're working with so and so client. Here is their code challenge. And here's how we're going to go about attempting to provide a solution. So, for instance, it would be, hey, we have a building with exterior openings that exceed 60 percent and eight feet from an adjacent building. And obviously that doesn't meet the extent of the IBC for fire separation distance. We're going to do a performance-based design approach to find an alternative to prove equal or greater fire resistance for the specific situation. Would you entertain that? That would be the discussion with the AHJ. They would say, yeah, you know, we've seen that before. We're willing to entertain it. Now we have our buy-in on the approach, not the solution. There are some cases where they say, oh, no, no, that, you know, fire modeling. We don't do this, thank you. Yeah, you know, you're just going to put garbage in and it's going to give you the solution, which can happen, right? Garbage in equals garbage out. So at that point, we take a step back. We help to provide some education on our next steps moving forward, getting their eye in and collaboration throughout the process, making them feel comfortable with it. Usually, we're successful with that. What that next step looks like is the design brief portion. So internally, we're going through, we're looking at our design documents, getting a method of approach, a methodology on how we're going to solve this code issue or attempt to solve this code issue. Maybe it's to provide additional sprinkler protection, increase the sprinkler design density, make some architectural changes, whatever it is that we think could prove this solution. And we're then going to develop the design brief. In the design brief, again, it reiterates the code challenge of issue prescriptively, what we're trying to overcome. Because again, the U.S. is based on a prescriptive code. So if we can't meet it, we have to provide the alternative. So it would identify what that is. It would identify what our basis is going to be, how we're going to go evaluating that condition, what our performance metrics are. And this is where, George, where we were discussing earlier on design fires, we're going to explicitly state in this portion of the analysis, we are going to evaluate an axisymmetric fire with energy based on four sprinklers activating, and that's going to be our design fire. Or we have justified two couches burning simultaneously as our design fire. So here you would not only say we follow these generic guidelines or we do it like everyone else, but you would point to specific design choices you've made with already providing explanations for these choices based on engineering knowledge, known sources, databases and fire science in general, yes? We do that at this step as well as justify our performance metrics. So what will be the pass signs in general, yes. We do that at this step as well as justify our performance metrics. So what will be the best fail, whether, you know, for tentability or heat flux, wall temperature, whatever our performance metrics are, we couple both of those in this design brief. Now it's not to say they can't change based on some type of design change moving forward. However, if they do change, we better have a good reason and justification for it. What this does is it protects the analysis. As we've all seen in our professional career, right, there could be cases where someone's designed a smoke control system mechanically and architecturally, they're limited to only 80,000 CFM, and they make the design fire work for them, right? That is what we don't want to do, and that's how we protect the city, the AHJ, our client, and ourselves as professionals by saying, this is how we're going to do the analysis. This way, when they get our final report, which is the final step after we do the whole approach, they don't see that, okay, well, you modeled a 1200 kilowatt fire in your design brief, you said 2400 kilowatt. What was the change here? What was this reduction? And if we don't have a reason for that, right, it's a flag of, okay, well, did you make this analysis work? Which, of course, jeopardizes us as a profession, right? And it's not an ethical thing to do. So that's overall our approach to PVD, that letter of intent for discussion on what we're going to do, the design brief, which outlines further details on what we're going to do and what's the pass fail criteria. And the AHJ, the stakeholders are involved in all of this so that they feel and they are a part of it. If they say, no, you know, you modeled a fire 10 feet from that exposure. But what if there's a car in between and we want to see the car break? So that gives them the opportunity to do that. And then we go ahead, do the analysis, issue the final report. And by then, everyone's been engaged the whole time. They understand the concept, they understand what we did, how we got to the conclusion, and it's a well-validated and smooth approach. And out of curiosity, how often would you be checked by the third-party consultants? What's the culture in there? Yeah, honestly, I feel a third-party reviewer is very important. And in the standards making committee, it is going to be a component of it. But honestly, again, I'm always very transparent with any discussion. I would say just shy of 50% is our work currently being engaged by a third party. The AHJ doesn't have to engage a third party currently in the States. I'm not sure about in your area, but they do have the option to, and it's at the cost of the client. So some AHJs, they may have an FPE on staff and are well familiar with this and feel comfortable reviewing it. So it's not that it doesn't get reviewed. Smaller cities, smaller jurisdictions, that is typically where we see them say, hey, I don't even know what I'm reading here. I'm going to hire another engineering firm to review this. If you're curious how it's in here, we very rarely would have a real third-party check. I think a lot of responsibility falls down on the firefighters because for common solutions, you just go with the code and even if you do like PBD for smoke control, it is a very common thing to do in here. So the knowledge is well propagated within the community, and most people can tell a simulation is crap by looking at it. It's a well-developed thing in here. And if you have a building that exceeds, for example, your floor area or evacuation path length or distances between buildings, you would go into some sort of derogation process from the law, which includes gaining opinion of your regional fire service, the state fire service at some point. And these guys are very experienced. So in a way, they take the responsibility of the third party on themselves, if they like it or not, if they're aware of that or not. Though I'm tunneling projects in which I'm very active, it happens. And this, I think, is a nice thing, but it's difficult and it adds time to the whole process. And I also had to, in the meantime, when you were talking, I had to recalculate how much 80,000 CFM in human units is, and that seems to be 135,920 cubic meters per hour. Sorry. That's funny, yeah. Yeah, I apologize for my English. No, no, it's okay. It's your problem. Sorry. Sorry, I was once forced to calculate BTUs and pressure explained in like pounds per square inch or something. That was something, that was absolutely something. I was writing down your process because I really like it and I wrote one word in other color education. So because you're repeating this process on and all, is this education still individual-based? Like this client is this, so we prepare special presentation for that? Or you already have resources you refer them to? And if so, how would that database would be built? Yeah, as far as the overall process, it's more individual. We do have some presentations to run them through. We're actually working right now on a really neat infographic that goes through each of these steps that I kind of ran through quickly. I think it ends up being a little more detailed. It's like 12 or 15 steps, and we will be rolling that out soon. So I'll get it up on my website, and that will be available for everyone to check out and use as a resource. What would be the website address? I'm going to link it. Yeah, so it would be our firm's address, which is pbfpe.com, performance-basedfireprotectionengineering.com. Nice. And it's not up there yet. We're working on rolling it out, making it all doctored up and pretty. But it will be a nice resource that we look forward to Yeah. Well, people in the audience, just check it every day and get that man some Google credibility by an inflow of clicks to his webpage. In the end, I really wanted to talk to you about your everyday job as a fire safety engineer and someone who's doing modeling a lot. And how does your routine of working on the model look like? I really wonder how the difference from my, I see posts of your company in LinkedIn and they're always interesting. And I see these amazing models and I'm really curious. Like, for example, do you work a lot with BIM models and transfer them to FDS? Great question. Yeah, great question. I'll be happy to share some of that with you. So as far as I'll kind of walk you through a model, I guess would be the easiest way. I love BIM models. I love Revit models. What I will say is in most cases, we are not directly importing those and utilizing them as our base model build. The approach that you can do through using like Pyro's Thunderheads PyroSIM is you can take a BIM model, get it as an IFC file, and import it into PyroSim. What I found in my experience is, obviously, creating your mesh around your domain, you could take the obstructions and thicken them all to try to snap them to a mesh. But especially in very complicated projects and buildings, I found that that snapping is very difficult to regulate, right? And a lot of times we get engaged pretty early, even what we call schematic design phase or early design development, where that Revit model isn't entirely completed. So, yeah, you may have saw my post just the other day on identifying leakages. Yeah, there's a thing I thought, wow, leakage, like my models don't really leak. But in fact, I didn't put it in the context of because i hear you i have the same the same issue for years and mine is not leakages mine is i i don't use structured mesh i use unstructured mesh which means that i try to put my mesh elements in a very different fashion everywhere. But if my software, my mesher finds obstruction next to a wall, which is like 10 nanometers away, like one pixel away in AutoCAD on print, you cannot see that. Walking through Revit model, you never see that. But if there are two lines, which you see as one, it's going to try and put a mesh between them, which ends up in really bad errors. So it's like the work with this type of operation is 99% cleaning up, 1% importing. Yeah. 100% same issue. So yeah, that specific video we're talking about, that was a quick opportunity from a client where they wanted to have a rough order magnitude of exhaust. So, yeah, to be honest, we took the Revit model, we put a mesh on it. I tried snapping obstructions. And as you can actually see in the video, there are numerous leaks. So very specific instances would we do that most often, good old-fashioned, taking floor plans, CADs or PDFs, marking them up, using them as backgrounds, and building that model from scratch by using solid obstructions of the walls, right, floor slab assemblies. Like you said, when I do it that way, I know that model is built correctly. With a few exceptions, we may miss a couple overlaps or something, or we misalign our meshes but that is my preferred approach even in a large arena maybe we just have the model specific portion of that arena again taking that random model one it's a huge file it's very cumbersome difficult to work with and as you said in my experience the time it takes to clean it up outweighs the time it takes if i just built it uh individually from scratch yeah from from the dimensional realm. And you said you sometimes, like in this project, you were asked for quick, rough outcome. So that's interesting. I wonder how you deal with that in terms of the quality of the model. Do you run sensitivity studies or you are just okay with the uncertainties because it's a rough first assumption? Yeah, more so the later with that disclaimer to the client. You know, hey, one, right, typically we don't have a design brief. We don't have a basis of design. So we do have to be careful here because when we model, say I throw in some sprinkler links and I do a quick sprinkler activation, that's great and that's good initial info. But, yeah, no, we're not doing full sensitivity. We're not looking at winter conditions for makeup air, summer conditions, wind, mesh cell sensitivity. We're not going to that extent. But in general, if we have some level of conservatism in there, we get a general sense of how we expect the system to work, especially a simple smoke control exhaust case. We'll get them in the order of magnitude. And I'll say, hey, I think you're going to be between 100 and 140,000 against CFM. And you need these doors to open. Again, this is just a quick picture. As you develop your project, we're going to have to dig into this more fine. More so, it's just initial one. Maybe the client's like, oh, I didn't know I was going to have an atrium. What's this going to look like? They want to get some quick numbers to get some pricing together because agents are expensive right yeah they are and in your but in your routine you would like assume that you are going to refine this in future and your final product would be like this but on the timeline you just have this five days to give a rough assumption or a week or or two weeks and then you have like a month to finalize so I ask that because in fire science, what I often observe is, and I hate it, I hate it the most. A lot of people write a scientific paper and they would just drop like half meter mesh and would say they were limited by the computational capabilities of their laptop or something and just live on with that. And then again, I see the market, I see consultants which are not okay with such simplification and are like you are very open about the limitations and I see scientists that are super okay because they had to get the paper pushed and I hate this fully and how do you find like your verification validation of your models you do that yourself or you rely on fire science and you use fds because it's the most validated probably pool we have yeah we definitely do stay pretty much within the fds framework because of the extensive validation and verification but yeah to fully paint the picture and in this specific instance we would you know say we're engaged with that client for a full smoke control rational analysis, right, a written document that has all that incorporated into it. We may tell them, hey, we'll get you an initial idea within a week or two, some rough modeling, we need to refine that. And then yeah, sometimes they're taken aback by how long we say we need four to six weeks for a simple atrium kind of seems crazy to them. But that's what it takes to get through, like you said, to do all the sensitivity on our extreme environmental conditions, atmospheric conditions, pressure, as well as mesh sensitivity. Most often we're making sure that we're falling within all the parameters. D-star, Q-star, there's been studies where it's been found to not be as detrimental as originally thought, but we do try to stay within those and at least do the due diligence to range our cell size, see how that affects the results. In most cases, again, for a simple smoke control system, it's usually not going to throw you off by a large order of magnitude, but you may see minor variance. And these performance metrics for the model itself, is this also in a way communicated with the AHIJ during the process and with the clients? It is in your initial draft, like we expect this to be like that? Absolutely, yeah. I mean, so when we look at tentability, there's been numerous cases where internally we like to look at visibility at six feet through a light emitting sign will increase our visibility factor for certain occupancies sometimes we'll keep we'll maintain it at a more demanding value but we've had we have had certain asas that say oh no i would like you to maintain visibility at eight feet because your egress sign is normally at eight feet you know it's above it yeah great well we will do that for sure so yeah we do that during the design brief stage before we do our final. That's cool. And going into the calculation process, I know you are building computers. I'm also following that on LinkedIn. I love that content that you provide. But there's a debate like cloud having in-house computer. I am also in the middle of that decision, actually. So we're also in the middle of purchasing a new supercomputer for ANSYS or just going fully into collaboration with another institute. I've also published that on LinkedIn some time ago. We've done very nice sensitivity studies with them, how fast we can go. And damn it, that's a banger. I guess you must go through the same challenges as well, right? Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's definitely a cost-benefit analysis for us. You know, when I first started my first FireMile project, yeah, I was using cloud-based programs. And as we grew, we did our first model machine, our second model machine, and now we're building our fourth. We're starting to put them into a rack arrangement. We're going to network them together, and we're having a lot of fun and success with that. So there's two sides of it. One, for the most part, we're able to handle our capacity in-house. And with those in-house machines, I'm able to fine-tune them and put in the hardware that I want. I'll give some plugs. So we're using AMD Ryzen Threadrippers. I've been talking about that in the field. Hey, are they working well for FDS? What are the limitations to them? I personally love them. I think Verizon is starting to get away from the Threadripper platform because they're improving their more baseline processors a little bit. So I don't know how long they're going to support or keep that product line going. But, I mean, we're getting 4.2 gigahertz of processing speed on these. They're pumping. They're moving quite well. That's insane, actually. Yeah. So I like to do them in-house. We're running models quick. We're able to do our validation sensitivity. That being said, just these past two weeks, all three model machines are at 100% capacity. So we still leverage those cloud computing servers. We use SableCore quite a bit. It's a great platform. The limitation is they, to be honest, they are a little bit slower, but they're reliable. They're doing the maintenance on them. They're on standby power. They meet certain federal regulations with security standards. So there is a lot of benefit to it. And we're cyclical. When we get really heavy, we put, I think I have 12 iterations going right now on stable core so yeah we use a combination of both and that's probably the choice we're gonna follow as well like with an in-house beast ready on demand and i also like the versatility to run my own scientific projects on it whenever i like without like asking for more money to pay the cloud fee I usually have. I love how this computational power and capabilities are cheaper and easier than ever before, which again is against that, what I've meant, what I hate most, seeing like, oh, I was limited with my computer. No one's limited with your computer, having Amazon Cloud Service or SabalCore or other cloud services out there. It's just a matter of budget and determination. And people would spend like dozens of thousands of dollars on fire tests to publish a paper. And why are we justifying bad work in here? I'm sorry, I'm ranting, but it annoys me. It annoys the hell out of me. No, no, I understand what you're saying yeah i mean there should be no reason that someone's trying to run a scientific and a technical model on a simple you know processor on their laptop you know first yeah some models it will work but you shouldn't limit you shouldn't not utilize the right model inputs just to get it to run right i guess is what i'm saying'm saying, right? You shouldn't expand your mesh on validation so it runs. If you do a one meter mesh, you will make a very large volume run on your laptop, but are the results valid? Versus if you don't have the computing power, I feel like the cloud servers are pretty reasonable. They're usually based on price per core hour. So if you have a four process model and it takes three days to run, I mean, you're looking at, I can't do the math in my head, you're looking at like under $20 US. So it's not, I understand cost is an issue, but it's not like these are. It's not prohibitive. Okay, David, thank you so much for this interesting discussion. Thank you for your openness to talk about the processes in your company and how you deal with PPD. Half of the audience of the podcast is scientists who probably never done engineering. So I think it's quite refreshing for them to hear about how the engineering world lives and what the issues are in here. Actually, maybe you have a message to fire scientists out there. How can they help engineers? And can you craft a message? What comes to your head first? Yeah, I think, you know, we just need to continually work on our connection between the fields and the parties. Obviously, we can leverage a lot off of each other, but there surely are disconnects at a very high technical level. It kind of goes downhill, right? You have your very high technical, at a very high technical level, it kind of goes downhill, right? You have your very high technical, your scientific level, engineers, HJs, firefighters, it all goes downhill. But we're all in the state, like we discussed, we're all for the common cause, which is to improve life safety and fire protection to citizens across the globe, as well as property conservation. So if we're not all in the same playing field, it's going to be difficult to achieve that. So yeah, we just all need to work together, connect with one another, talk to each other on a professional level to understand where we can complement each other and work towards that. Thank you so much for coming here. Thank you so much for sharing. And I hope to see you soon. Absolutely. Yeah, thank you. And that's it for this episode. I hope you really enjoyed this discussion with David about fire engineering and other aspects around the life of a fire engineer out there. I really enjoyed his views from the perspective of a firefighter, from the perspective of someone who communicates with authorities a lot, someone who has to convey the messages, someone who has to convey the messages, someone who has to prepare drafts of his designs and explain them and make sure they are sound, make informed choices, be responsible for uncertainties and all other aspects of what real performance-based fire engineering is. If you never had the chance to design a building or design fire safety systems in a building, I hope this episode has brought you a little insight into the mind of design fire safety systems in a building, I hope this episode has brought you a little insight into the mind of a fire safety engineer or fire protection engineer. What are the choices being done and how the work looks from the inside? And if you are a fire protection engineer and what we were discussing is your bread and butter, I guess you still have found some interesting insights how the job is done in other places. And I certainly did from my perspective. I've learned a lot from David and I highly appreciate his openness to discuss the subjects, how he runs his company, how are his frameworks, how he does these little things that they are not that very often shared. So certainly that was a gem. Thank you very much, David, for your honesty and openness. And it was such a great discussion. We need to do this again. And that would be it for today's episode. I hope you liked it. And if you did, as said in the opening, please leave a review. Please give me a five star rating. It helps a lot. I've discovered that recently, and it really does. And, yeah, if you enjoy the show, well, good news. Next episode next Wednesday. See you there. Cheers. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
